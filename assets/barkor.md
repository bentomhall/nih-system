When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, their speed is reduced to zero until the start of their next turn.

Expend 2 STA. You and all creatures in a 15' long line that is 10' wide behind you (relative to the target point in space) gain advantage on the saving throw and the shielded creatures take no damage if they succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if they fail.
