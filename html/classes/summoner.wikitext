==Summoner==
Trying to mimic the feel of the Final Fantasy 7+ summons. They show up, they do (big thing), then they disappear. Maybe with a charge mechanic.

Probably thematically either a fey cycle, elemental cycle, or astral (celestial/fiend) cycle.

===Thoughts===
Mode switch. Internalized -> Externalized. When Internalized, each of the different summons provides a passive bonus. Some amount of charges to Externalize the summons, producing some effect, but removing the passive. Each summon can only be used once per period, but you learn more and new ways to deal.
