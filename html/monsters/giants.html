		<h1 class="section">Giants</h1>
		<p>Giants in all their forms descend from the ancient titans. Contrary to the name, titans were of reasonably normal stature. But they possessed the power of True Words in the form of runes, often inscribed on their bodies. These runes gave them control over matter, allowing them to transform into hulking figures many tens of feet (some even a hundred) feet tall and with strength to move mountains.</p>
		<p>After the Titan-Wyrm wars and the treachery of Isskap with the Orb of All Might, the titans' runic power was broken, leaving them incapable of voluntarily transforming; the result were the ancestors of today's jazuu and dwarves (the latter being those whose power was stripped to create the Orb in the first place). Instead, the last remnants of their power went into the creation of the Titanwalls, runic constructs that could rewrite a jazuu, transforming them permanently into a true giant...if they survived and were able to control the process. Those who failed to control the transformation or who bailed out early became the giant-kin. In a cruel twist of fate, true giants are sterile, but giant-kin breed true. Thus, true giants are rare, but giant-kin have spread throughout all the continents of Quartus.</p>
		<h3 class="subsection">True Giants</h3>
		<p>The transformation at a Titanwall can be likened to a reprogramming--one translation goes as follows.</p>

		<h2 class="subsection">Giant-kin</h2>
		<p>The original giant-kin were failed candidates for the true giant transformation ritual...those that survived anyway. In a cruel twist of ironic fate, these failed transformations retained their fertility and have multiplied. All in all, the giant-kin vastly outnumber the true giants, at least in Noefra and Soefra. Giant-kin are less common in Oelfra, where the better-maintained Titanwalls led to fewer failures. But they still exist.</p>
		<p>Giant-kin tend to have some flaw in their makeup--ogres are congenitally stupid, trolls are preternaturally hungry, and the twin heads of the ettin make them prone to something akin to split personalities...wth a vengeance. The "fey ogres", sometimes called ogre magi or oni, are often consumed by their hunger for power and prone to megalomania.</p>
		<h2>Ogres</h2>
		<p>Dumb, brutish, and strong, ogres make up the majority of all giant-kin. On their own, they rarely progress beyond stone tools and uncured leather, living in primitive tribes ruled by the strongest and most brutal of them. Many of them have become mercenaries, led by smarter folks, including "half ogres", who are really throwbacks to their jazuu heritage. Ogres are only marginally cross-fertile with humans, although they can interbreed with jazuu fairly easily. This doesn't stop them from trying. This is not always rape, although ogre culture prizes strength and so misunderstandings are unfortunately common. Ogre women are often bigger and stronger than their menfolk and frequently keep the men in line with cuffs and curses.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Common.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Found throughout the Federated Nations, but especially in the eastern Sea of Grass, Giant-spine Mountains, and the Sundown Hills.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Rarely more involved than "yell and charge at the nearest foe". Fairly easy to intimidate by someone who appears big and strong, they do not respect or understand magic and will prefer to crush mages rather than run in fear.</p>

		<h2>Fey Ogres</h2>
		<p>AKA oni or ogre magi, these aren't truly ogres nor are they fey. They're what happens when ogres or jazuu are heavily influenced by fey (usually maliciously). They wield semi-primal magics, usually trickery-related, and can shapeshift. Most ogre communities hate and fear the oni, casting them out or killing them when their powers are discovered. Jazuu communities tend to be more tolerant, until the young oni starts wielding its powers improperly. In return, oni tend to despise ogres and jazuu, delighting in tricking and manipulating them.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Rare. Only 1 in a thousand ogre children may be born as an oni.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Anywhere ogres are found, but usually on the outskirts. They also delight in manipulating other mortals. They often lead packs of other malicious giant-kin or humanoids.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Trickery and self-preservation are the name of the game. They prefer to avoid revealing their nature where possible, and will flee (leaving their allies in the lurch) if pressed.</p>

If the fey ogre dies, it reverts to its true form, and its glaive reverts to its normal size.</p>
			</div>

		<h2>Troll</h2>
		<p>Green-skined, lanky, with long claws and fangs, trolls are the incarnation of insatiable hunger. Their constant regeneration makes them prone to mutations. Even when their body is well fed, they still feel hunger gnawing at them. Troll societies tend to be small, just a family unit at most, and the female will drive off or eat the children once they're grown. Trolls do not share territory well, generally. As such, they are often considered kill-on-sight foes of civilization wherever they are found. Even the "civilized" ones are a constant danger--if their hunger gets the better of them they will eat anything, including and almost preferring other sentient creatures.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Uncommon near civilization, but all too common in outlying areas.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Swamps and jungles. The northern Jungle of Fangs and Bloodthirst Wildlands are home to many clusters of trolls.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> While regenerating, trolls fear nothing. Once their regeneration is stopped by fire or acid, they become much more defensive. They will focus-fire on anyone that deals either of these damage types to them. If hungry, they will try to down a character and drag them off to be consumed.</p>

If the troll takes acid or fire damage, its maximum hit points are reduced by the damage taken.</p>

		<h2>Ettin</h2>
		<p>Two-headed, twisted aberrations, the ettin prove that two heads <em>aren't</em> always better than one. Their heads are prone to bickering and outright not cooperating with each other. The rare ettin whose heads are in complete agreement is a serious threat, however. And the very rare few who turn to magic are a potent force, as they can cast two spells simultaneously.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Rare. Ettin are the least common of the giant-kin.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Open broken lands, especially in the Windwalker Confederacy.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Hulk smash.</p>
