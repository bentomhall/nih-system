\section{Celestials}
Creatures of the astral who are encountered in their own forms (either on the Astral plane or having traveled to another plane under their own power or that of an Ascendant) are called "celestials", after the most prominent group, the angels. Additionally, Mortal-plane creatures touched by strong amounts of Ascendant power may become MORE than they were. These two are counted as celestials--among them the heavenly flying horse, the pegasus, and the horned protector and friend to the innocent, the unicorn.
\subsection{Angels}
"Angel" most properly denotes the members of the Angelic Hosts, those sworn to the endless battle to keep the universe safe from threats from Beyond. In common parlance, however, it means all sapient lucians who act on the orders of the Great Mechanism or various Ascendants. They inhabit either their own, often vaguely humanoid bodies of aether or wondrous shells of aether. Because their essence is of the Astral directly, they don't have the vulnerability to silver that fiends do.

Don't mistake their luminous, kindly appearances for beneficence or goodness or kindness. Most often, angels are sent to the Mortal and other planes on specific missions, often of vengeance, justice, or punishment. Some are good and kindly, others are not. But angels are almost always \textit{dutiful}, even if that means wreaking havoc on mortals.

	\DndMonsterAction{Astral Edge} The blade archon's weapon attacks deal an additional 1d6 radiant damage (included in the attacks). This is an inherent property of the archon, not a property of the weapon.
	
	\DndMonsterAction{Dancing Blades} The blade archon is accompanied by two floating longswords that it uses to make attacks either in melee or at range, giving it much larger reach than normal.
	
	\DndMonsterSection{Actions}
	\DndMonsterAction{Multiattack} The Archon attacks twice with its longswords. It can use Confeitor in place of either of those attacks if available.

	\DndMonsterAction{Confeitor (Recharge 5-6)} The floating blades spin around him, creating after-images. These images shoot outward, piercing all creatures within 15 feet. Targets must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, taking 4d6 psychic damage on a failure or half as much on a success. Creatures that fail are \nameref{condition:shaken} by memories of their sins and regrets until the end of their next turn.

    \DndMonsterAction{Distant Aid} The angel can cast any spell that only targets allies out to a range of 60 ft, even if the range is smaller. This also extends the radius of aura-type spells.

    \textit{Concentration:} \nameref{spell:arcane-binding} (2x), \nameref{spell:bless} (1x)
