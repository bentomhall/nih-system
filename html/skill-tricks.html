<h1 class="chapter" id="skill-tricks">Skill Tricks</h1>

<p>Those who are particularly adept at certain aspects of adventuring often learn ways to use their talents to perform tricks that seem supernatural or magical to outside observers. While they are not magical in the same sense as spells or invocations, per se, they do produce effects not normally possible.</p>

<p>Each skill trick detailed below shares some common characteristics:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>A cost</b>. Most skill tricks cost something, whether expending a replaceable tool, damaging a weapon or armor, or (most commonly) expending Stamina or Aether or both.</li>
	<li><b>An ability score</b>. Every skill trick is tied to a particular ability score. That ability score sets its DC.</li>
	<li><b>A prerequisite</b>. Every skill trick has one or more prerequisites before it can be learned. These are generally either a particular level of proficiency (numerical value, which does not includes expertise) for those that are tied to a particular skill or tool, or a character level for those marked as General.</li>
	<li><b>A target or targets</b>. Many skill tricks target either an object or one or more creatures. A few target a particular area.</li>
	<li><b>An effect</b>. The text of the skill trick describes the effect, as well as any saving throws required.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="subsection">Skill Trick DCs</h3>
<p>The DC for any saving throws required by skill tricks is given by</p>

<div class="centered">
<b>8 + the relevant ability score + your proficiency bonus</b>
</div>

<p>regardless of whether the trick involves a proficiency or not. If you have expertise in the relevant skill or tool, targets have disadvantage on the saving throw.</p>

<h3 class="subsection" id="acquiring-skill-tricks">Acquiring Skill Tricks</h3>

<p>Some classes get native access to Skill Tricks as a class feature. If they grant access to more advanced skill tricks beyond the basic ones at particular levels, that access overrides any prerequisites in the skill trick. Everyone else can choose a skill trick that they qualify for whenever they acquire an Ability Score Improvement from their class. At the same time, they can trade out one skill trick they've learned for a different one they qualify for.</p>

On a failure, they can't focus on anything but you and are effectively blinded and deafened to all other occurrences.

<div><em>Wisdom (Medicine) Advanced Skill Trick</em></div>

<p>As an action, you can attempt to resuscitate someone who died within the last minute. Make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against a DC of 15 + the number of rounds since they died.

<h3 class="subsection" id="skulker">Skulker</h3>

<div><em>Dexterity (Stealth) Advanced Skill Trick</em></div>

<p>You can attempt to hide even if only lightly obscured. Additionally, missing with an attack does not remove the hidden or invisible status.</p>

<h3 class="subsection" id="snow-job">Snow Job</h3>

<div><em>Charisma (Deception) Advanced Skill Trick</em></div>

<p>When you make a Charisma (Deception) check to convince someone you know something you don't or are someone you are not, you do so at advantage. In addition, if you succeed by more than 5, the target willingly tells you the missing information.</p>

<h3 class="subsection" id="sunder">Sunder</h3>

<div><em>Strength (Carpentry, Mason's, or Blacksmith's Tools) Advanced Skill Trick</em></div>

<p>Alternatively, you can target attended objects as follows, expending 2 STA:</p>
<ul>

	<li><b>Weapons</b>: Make an attack against the target's AC. On a hit, the target takes half damage from the attack and has disadvantage on all attacks made with that weapon.</li>
	<li><b>Wielded spell foci or other objects in hand</b>: Make an attack at disadvantage against the target's AC. On a hit, the focus is knocked from their grasp and lands 1d6 \texttimes 5 ft away in a random direction.</li>
</ul>

<div><em>Strength (Athletics) Advanced Skill Trick</em></div>

<p>You can grapple and shove creatures two sizes larger than yourself. If you expend 1 STA, you can remove the size limit entirely.</p>

<p>Additionally, when you start your turn with a creature grappled, you can expend 1 STA and attempt a second grapple check. If you succeed, the target is restrained until the grapple ends.</p>

<p>Expert skill tricks require a +5 proficiency or level 13 characters.</p>

<h3 class="subsection" id="blindfighter">Blindfighter</h3>

<div><em>Wisdom (Perception) Expert Skill Trick</em></div>

<p>Invisible or unseen enemies no longer have advantage to hit you. In addition, you do not have disadvantage to hit invisible or unseen enemies and gain blindsight out to 10 ft. If you already have blindsight or gain it later, this stacks.</p>

<h3 class="subsection" id="break-will">Break Will</h3>

<div><em>Charisma (Intimidation) Expert Skill Trick</em></div>

<p>This skill trick acts like <a href="#demoralize">Demoralize</a> except that you can force any number of creatures that can see and hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw, becoming <a href="conditions.html#broken">broken</a> on a failure and <a href="conditions.html#frightened">frightened</a> of you on a success.

	<li>You can expend 3 AET as a reaction to attempt to disrupt spellcasting by a creature you can see within 60 ft. of you. Make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against a DC of 10 + the spell level. On a success, the spell fails. If you have the Spellcasting feature, you can substitute your spellcasting ability for Intelligence.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="subsection" id="dungeoncrasher">Dungeoncrasher</h3>

<div><em>Strength (Athletics) Expert Skill Trick</em></div>

<p>When you move at least 10 feet before attempting to shove a creature, you can shove any size of creature. In addition, the distance you can shove creatures increases by 5 ft. for every STA you expend when making the check. If the creature is stopped short of the full distance by a hard surface, they must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they are stunned until the end of their next turn. If they are stopped by running into a creature of their size or smaller, the other creature is knocked prone unless they succeed on a Strength saving throw.</p>

<h3 class="subsection" id="find-portal">Find Portal</h3>

<div><em>Wisdom (Survival) Expert Skill Trick</em></div>

<p>You search for signs of an accessible planar portal within 1 mile of you. Make a Wisdom (Survival) check and expend 2 AET, with advantage if you also are proficient in Arcana. The result determines your success:</p>

<table>
	<tr><th>Check Total</th><th>Result</th></tr>
	<tr><td>&lt; 10</td><td></td>You find a portal to a plane of the DM's choosing. The location on that plane that it leads to is dangerous.</tr>

<div><em>Dexterity (Stealth) Expert Skill Trick</em></div>

<p>When you are hidden, you no longer need to be concealed to remain hidden, but you must expend 1 STA for every turn you spend hidden without concealment.

<h3 class="subsection" id="slippery">Slippery</h3>

<div><em>Dexterity (Acrobatics) Expert Skill Trick</em></div>

<p>You can no longer be grappled or restrained by non-legendary effects as long as you spend 1 STA when the effect is applied.</p>

<div><em>Charisma (Persuasion) Master Skill Trick</em></div>

<p>As an action, you can magically call for a truce even during combat, expending 3 AET. All creatures that can understand your language must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they become non-hostile until someone takes a hostile action. This ability does not work on mindless creatures, including zombies and skeletons.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you are not actively fighting someone, you can force them to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, their disposition to you increases by one step for 10 minutes or until you take hostile action against them. Once the effect ends, they will still follow through on any bargains struck during that time, but their disposition toward you may change.</p>

<h3 class="subsection" id="force-portal">Force Portal</h3>

<div><em>Wisdom (Survival) Master Skill Trick</em></div>

<p>As an action and expending 4 AET, you force a micro-fissure in the fabric of the planes to form a full-fledged portal that lasts for 6 seconds. You can choose what plane it exits to, but only a rough description of the location on that plane.</p>

<h3 class="subsection" id="healing-hands">Healing Hands</h3>
