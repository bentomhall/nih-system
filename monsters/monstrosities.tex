\section{Monstrosities}\label{sec:monstrosities}
Monstrosities are the catch-all category for things that aren't shaped roughly like a person. Does it speak but look like a \hyperref[sec:beasts]{beast}? Does it have magical abilities but not fit into another category? Was it created by a mage in a long-ago day but now breed normally? Then it's probably a monstrosity.
