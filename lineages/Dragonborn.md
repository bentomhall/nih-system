### Dragonborn
Created about 800 years ago by forcing fragments of draconic souls into unborn human children, dragonborn have carved out an place for themselves in the harsh terrain of the Kairen Mountains. Their culture is clan-based and warlike, as they are under constant threat from creatures of ice and winter that live on the Nocthian Plateau on the other side of the mountains. Within the last 5 years, a sizeable group of dragonborn that had been isolated in the Council Lands rejoined the remainder in Wyrmhold. Divided into 6 clans (of which 5 are playable, the 6th being the royal clan and very small), each clan has specialized the training of its members. Each clan includes members of all elemental heritages (as that is an individual trait, not a family one).

Physically, dragonborn are scaled-skin humanoids standing taller than most humans (5’6” to 6’2”). They stand upright but have lizard-like tails, and their scales are different colors depending on which element their souls resonate with. While appearing reptilian, they are still mammalian, bearing live young and nursing them just like the humans they originated from. Their skins, while not as tough as the scales of dragons, are relatively insensitive and tough and so they often wear fewer clothes for incidental protection. They still wear armor as normal, with custom-made boots that leave their clawed toes free. They have hair or feather-like crests and/or horns or leathery crests.

#### Names: 
By convention, all dragonborn use names following the pattern <Given> <Status> <Clan>. The clans are described above, and the status marker is either ka for nobles or vo for the common folk.

Common male dragonborn names include: Aodh, Arthfael, Caderyn, Caomh, Cynbel, Cynwrig, Drustan, Judoc, Maedoc, Nechtan, and Seisyll. Common female dragonborn names include: Abi, Ailsa, Beathag, Catrina, Beitris, Elspeth, Fiona, Iona, Isobel, Jean, Kenna, Lilias, Mhairi, Morven, Seona, Sheona, and Una.

***Breath Weapon***. You can use your bonus action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.

When you use your breath weapon, each creature must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

***Damage Resistance***. You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.

***Languages***. You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.
