\subsection{Fiends}
"Fiend" is the word used by mortals to describe any resident of the Astral or Abyssal (few make a differentiation, although the differences are many) summoned via ritual or magic into another plane as weapons or soldiers and given a body woven of aether to inhabit. These "combat forms" have become quite standardized over the centuries, chosen as much for their intimidating looks as for their raw combat potential. One side effect of this new form is that killing a fiend on the Mortal requires trapping their core essence and dispersing it--simply shattering the body by physical or magical force just ends the spell and sends them back to where they came from. It does irritate them considerably though; they can feel pain in their borrowed forms just like in their "true" forms.

The more powerful the summoned entity, the greater expenditure of aether is required to house it. A Flame Fiend, for example, is one of the most potent of its kind and can summon others subservient to it, while an imp or a dretch are the lowliest, the latter barely capable of thought.

Such aether-born shells, however, do have a weakness to silver, as it disrupts the complex patterns that contain their otherplanar essence. Damage done by silvered weapons leaves them weakened, if just for a moment.

\DndMonsterAction{Wall of Ice (Recharge 6)}
The fiend magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet in diameter.

When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the fiend is incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.

A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.\\nOn a failed save, the cube enters the creature’s space, and the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed.

\DndMonsterAction{Ethereal Sight} The ghost can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.

\DndMonsterAction{Incorporeal Movement} The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

\DndMonsterSection{Actions}
\DndMonsterAttack[
	name=Withering Touch,

]

\DndMonsterAction{Etherealness}
The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.
\DndMonsterAction{Horrifying Visage}
Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 \texttimes 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a \textit{greater restoration} spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.

One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the \textit{dispel evil and good} spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body.

\DndMonsterAction{Luring Song}
The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.

While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24 hours.

\DndMonsterAction{Petrifying Gaze} When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the \textit{greater restoration} spell or other magic.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.
