		<h2 class="section">Celestials</h2>
		<p>Creatures of the astral who are encountered in their own forms (either on the Astral plane or having traveled to another plane under their own power or that of an Ascendant) are called "celestials", after the most prominent group, the angels. Additionally, Mortal-plane creatures touched by strong amounts of Ascendant power may become MORE than they were. These two are counted as celestials--among them the heavenly flying horse, the pegasus, and the horned protector and friend to the innocent, the unicorn.</p>
		<h3 class="subsection">Angels</h3>
		<p>"Angel" most properly denotes the members of the Angelic Hosts, those sworn to the endless battle to keep the universe safe from threats from Beyond. In common parlance, however, it means all sapient lucians who act on the orders of the Great Mechanism or various Ascendants. They inhabit either their own, often vaguely humanoid bodies of aether or wondrous shells of aether. Because their essence is of the Astral directly, they don't have the vulnerability to silver that fiends do.</p>
		<p>Don't mistake their luminous, kindly appearances for beneficence or goodness or kindness. Most often, angels are sent to the Mortal and other planes on specific missions, often of vengeance, justice, or punishment. Some are good and kindly, others are not. But angels are almost always <em>dutiful</em>, even if that means wreaking havoc on mortals.</p>
		<h2>Astral Eye</h2>
		<p>Less a fully independent entity and more an "astral construct" used by the angelic legions as a mobile scouting and support platform, the Astral Eye takes the shape of a transparent crystalline sphere with a single eye floating in it, with the sphere surrounded by multiple revolving rings etched with symbols of power. The whole thing glows with a golden light.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Extremely rare. Only scholars of the astral know of their existence, as they rarely interact with mortals.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Found in company with other angels, wherever those are found throughout the planes.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> The Eye will generally use Divine Inspiration on its first turn and then hangs back, using Righteous Jaunt as necessary to avoid melee and otherwise using Burning Beam. Target priority depends on the other angels present--it will tend to focus fire. Like all angels, the Astral Eye will not retreat unless ordered to by its superiors.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Blade Archon</h2>
		<p>The blade archon is the workhorse offensive combat angel. Humanoid in shape except for the broad wings of aether floating near their armored backs, their faces masked with opaque white masks marked only with their legion and host affiliation, they are nameless and faceless destroyers of all that is aberrant or dangerous to the realms. Their floating blades, wielded by the power of their minds, can both slice the body and force the soul to revisit its regrets and wrongs.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Uncommon. Most encounters with angels of the legions involves at least one blade archon, but those encounters are themselves rare. Intelligence (Religion) gives more information.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Throughout the planes, but rarely on the Mortal. Wherever they're found, they're found in groups with other angels and with a specific purpose in mind.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Unless given other orders, blade archons will fight fully offensively, preferring to get fully stuck in a cluster of enemies. Against mortals, they will primarily fight to disable or shatter morale, killing only when necessary or when ordered to or when the mortal is suspected of involvement with aberrants or demons. Confeitor is used as early as possible when it would hit 2 or more creatures and then again when it recharges. Otherwise, they prefer to be in melee.</p>

			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Astral Edge.</b></p>
				<p>The blade archon's weapon attacks deal an additional 1d6 radiant damage (included in the attacks). This is an inherent property of the archon, not a property of the weapon.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Dancing Blades.</b></p>
				<p>The blade archon is accompanied by two floating longswords that it uses to make attacks either in melee or at range, giving it much larger reach than normal.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Actions</h3>
			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Multiattack.</b></p>

			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Confeitor (Recharge 5-6).</b></p>
				<p>The floating blades spin around him, creating after-images. These images shoot outward, piercing all creatures within 15 feet. Targets must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, taking 4d6 psychic damage on a failure or half as much on a success. Creatures that fail are  <a href="../conditions.html#shaken">shaken</a> by memories of their sins and regrets until the end of their next turn.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Seraph</h2>
		<p>The seraphim are the support casters of the angelic legions. Their role is to stand behind the archons and rain bolts of astral aether on their foes while healing the wounds of the front line. This does not make them easy targets, however. Like the archons, they are humanoid in appearance except for their wings of radiant energy and their opaque, eyeless masks that do not inhibit their vision. Seraphim wear robes over their armor and do not carry visible weapons. </p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Uncommon. Most encounters with angels of the legions involves at least one seraph, but those encounters are themselves rare. Intelligence (Religion) gives more information.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Throughout the planes, but rarely on the Mortal. Wherever they're found, they're found in groups with other angels and with a specific purpose in mind.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Unless given other orders, seraphim will fight defensively unless an aberrant or demon is present, in which case they will bend all efforts to destroy that one creature. Against mortals, they will primarily fight to disable or shatter morale, killing only when necessary or when ordered to. Or when the mortal is suspected of involvement with aberrants or demons. Seraphim prefer to stay back and throw sacred lances, using their spells to defend, heal, and support their allies.</p>

		<h2>Valorites</h2>
		<p>Valorites and their sergeants are the defensive line of the legions, making up the bulk of the 3rd Host's 1st Legion (aka the Anvil). While they can fly like all other angels, they prefer to form ranks with their tower shields and short swords. Let the blade archons charge the foe--valorites prefer to receive the charge and have it shatter on their bulwark.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Uncommon. Valorites are rarely encountered on Quartus--they're most common out in the endless battlefield of the outer system near the Crystal Shell. Intelligence (Religion) gives more information.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Throughout the planes, but rarely on Quartus. Wherever they're found, they're found in groups with other valorites and with a specific purpose in mind. A group of valorites is usually led by a sergeant, more heavily armored and armed and giving commands.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Valorites traditionally form ranks with others and push as a formation. Usually a group of seraphs or other ranged angels occupy the center of the formation, protected by the bodies and shields of the valorites. While in formation, they are resistant to missile or ranged spell fire. They prefer to let the enemies come to them.</p>

		<h3 class="subsection">Astral-Touched Mortal Creatures</h3>
		<p>Just like humanoids can be plane-touched, so too can various beasts. This is rare, and the resulting creature is generally associated with either purity or healing. The two most well-known of these are the unicorn (a symbol of purity and healing for the land) and the pegasus, a symbol of freedom. Most of these are native to the Astral (born from imported beasts) rather than arising naturally on the Mortal plane.</p>
		
		<h2>Pegasus</h2>
		<p>Most commonly seen as the steed of a powerful oathbound, pegasi are found in small flocks in the high mountain regions of Quartus and commonly serve divine messengers from the Astral. Appearing as a shimmering white horse with feathered wings, they have a sense of justice and will allow people to ride them in service of holy causes. Divine messengers often appear riding these winged horses.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Very rare.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> The astral plane and a few isolated high-mountain areas.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Pegasi prefer to avoid combat wherever possible unless being ridden by a creature they have accepted. If someone unworthy tries to mount them, they will try to buck the sinner off and flee.</p>

		<h2>Unicorn</h2>
		<p>The unicorn is a widely-recognized symbol of purity. Some cultures believe that unicorns will only associate with virgins...that is not inherently true (although some unicorns may prefer that). As intelligent as an average human, these horned, astral-touched fey creatures communicate telepathically when they choose. Do beware--purification is not always a pleasant experience, and unicorns often hold to an extremely high standard of purity. Of course not all unicorns actually care about this--some are just majestic, horned, intelligent and telepathic magically-enhanced equines.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Extremely rare. No unicorn sightings have been confirmed in western Noefra for the last 50 years. It's said that unicorns played a part in the Refugee Seekers' flight from the last battlefield of the Cataclysm War, but at this point that's just legend. Intelligence (Nature) gives more information.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Unknown. Probably more common in the wild areas of the Astral plane.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Unicorns rarely engage in combat except to defend themselves and their chosen areas. When necessary, they will charge in and gore their opponents before striking with their hooves.</p>
