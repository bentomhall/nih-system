<h2 class="section">Dragons</h2>

<p>All dragons trace their descent from the wyrms of old, primal forces of destruction whose speech unmade matter, returning it to pure elemental force. True dragons retain the largest portion of that essence and are tied to elements; false dragons were either bred from wyrm essence or are the non-sapient descendents of corrupted dragons.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Dragon, True</h3>

<p>All true dragons are born as chromatic, rainbow colored hatchlings. Before they leave the nest, they undergo the First Molt, which involves seeking out a form of elemental or planar energy and encysting themselves inside, becoming attuned to that elemental energy if they survive, awakening as wyrmlings. As they grow, they undergo a Second Molt, becoming young dragons when their hoard imperative awakens. This hoard imperative is the driving force for all maturing true dragons. It commands them to seek out and gather <em>something</em>, which could be as simple as shiny coins or gems...or as esoteric as the smiles on people's faces when they hear a story. This hoard serves as the dragon's strength and weakness--it channels the aether of the land to the dragon, extending their lifespans and fueling their power (both physical and magical), but if it is lost or destroyed, the dragon experiences extreme trauma, often dying (but not before going berserk and destroying everything around it). Some few dragons can find a new hoard, but dragons protect their hoards with their lives. Once a young dragon collects enough of a hoard, it undergoes the Third Molt, becoming an adult. Adult dragons are mature and fertile, forming bonds with other dragons. Most dragons end their lifecycle here; a few have the added need to dominate other dragons. These eventually undergo a Fourth Molt, becoming the fearsome ancients, leaders of dragon flights. Many dragons have the ability to transform into mortal forms (although they retain their draconic power)</p>

<p>Dragons are intensely magical creatures--their very bones and body is steeped in elemental energy. As such, a true dragon's corpse is quite valuable to alchemists and crafters and mages of all kinds; the eggs of true dragons (which can last centuries in a "fossilized" state before hatching when exposed to the correct energies) have been used as arcane power sources. Both of these uses cause extremely negative from any true dragons who discover them.</p>

<p>Some dragons seek out and learn mortal magic--this effort leaves them visually changed for reasons that are not clear. Their scales become metallic. Generally, metallic dragons are more tolerant of humanoid mortals than their chromatic (non-metallic) kin; their hoards tend to reflect their mortal-focused nature. This does not make them less dangerous. For many metallics, manipulating mortals is a form of a game and they have little concern for the wellbeing of their play pieces except as sources of their hoard.</p>
