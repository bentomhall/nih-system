## Alternate Lineage Development
Rethinking how races (now called "lineages") work for PC construction.

**Lineage**: The "biological" part. Every lineage specifies

- Size (both category and suggested height/weight bands)
- Age (both age of physical maturity and usual max age)
- Base speed (walking + any others as appropriate)
- Ability Score Increase (+1 to one ability score from the list given, total ASI cannot exceed +2 to any given ability score)
- Status. One of "core", "regional X", "rare", and "X-touched". Core lineages are found everywhere and raise no especial eyebrows. Regional lineages are common/normal in region X, but will raise eyebrows elsewhere. Rare lineages raise eyebrows everywhere. Touched (X) is special--these are more like templates attached to core or regional lineages rather than independent lineages. They may add, change, or modify characteristics of the parent lineage.
- Some combination of features. One minor feature only counts as half of a major feature; each lineage has the equivalent of 2 major features.

**Culture**: The area you come from. In general, any lineage can come from any culture. Restrictions are as noted in each description. Cultures specify

- Region (where they're mostly found)
- Ability Score Increase (+1 to one ability score from the list given, total ASI cannot exceed +2 to any given ability score)
- Extra languages. 1 or more languages other than Common, which every adventurer speaks.
- Proficiencies. 3 total proficiencies (tools, skills, or otherwise).
- Feature. One major-equivalent feature.

**Background**: As currently, except also pick an ability score to increase by +1 of your choice. Total from lineage, culture, and background can't exceed +2 to any single ability score (so +1/+1/+1 or +2/+1).

### Lineages

***Age***: adult at 16, lives until 80-ish

***Size***: Medium. 5' - 6'6", 100-300 lbs

***Speed***: 30ft.

***Status***: Core

***Desperate Plea (+)***: As a reaction when you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can choose to reroll the check and take the second result. If you had advantage or disadvantage, the reroll does as well. You can use this trait a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.

***Cultural Mimicry***: Choose any feature granted by a different culture than the one you chose.

#### Dwarf

***Ability Score Increase***: +1 Constitution

***Age***: physically adult at 20, lives until 150-ish

***Size***: Medium. 4' - 5'6", 150-250 lbs

***Speed***: 30ft.

***Status***: core

***Stone's Endurance (+)***: When you expend a hit die as part of a short rest, you can choose to either remove a level of exhaustion (keeping the rolled healing) or maximize the healing received from that hit die. You can use this feature once per short rest.

***Darkvision***: You have darkvision out to 60ft.

***Poison Resistance***: You have resistance to poison damage and make Constitution saving throws against being poisoned at advantage.

#### Ihmisi (aka wood elf)

***Ability Score Increase***: +1 Dexterity
***Age***: adult at 20, lives until 120-ish
***Size***: Medium. 5' - 5'9", 80-180 lbs
***Speed***: 30ft.

***Voices of the Kami (+)***: While on the mortal plane you can meditate for 1 minute. During that time, your senses (vision and hearing) expand to 100ft (increasing to 200ft starting at level 5, 500ft starting at level 11, and 1000 ft at level 17) regardless of natural obstructions and you can sense the presence and number of any creatures within range. The exact location of "unnatural" creatures (fiends, undead, aberrations, or celestials) are pinpointed and you know their type. In cities or other "worked" environments, the range is halved and only unnatural creatures are sensed. You cannot see through or into buildings or other constructed obstructions. You can use this trait a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.

***Trance***: Instead of sleeping during a long rest, you spend the 6 hours of 'sleep' in a semi-conscious state, still able to perceive your environment.

***Size***: Medium. 5'6" - 7', 150-350 lbs

***Speed***: 35ft.

***Status***: core

***Red Fang's Legacy (+)***: Once per long rest, you can rage as if you were a level 1 barbarian, except that you can concentrate on spells (but not cast them) while raging in this way. If you have the Rage class feature, you instead can use that feature an additional time per long rest and can concentrate on spells while raging.

***Relentless Advance***: Your speed increases by 5ft (included in the speed entry).

***Brutal Critical***: When you critically hit with an attack, instead of rolling the damage dice twice, roll the damage dice for the attack once and add the result to the maximum roll of the dice (ie max + roll). Features that increase the number of critical dice are not maximized.

#### Gwerin (aka high elves)

***Ability Score Increase***: +1 Intelligence

***Age***: adult around 20, live to 190-200

***Size***: Medium. 5'4" - 6'5", 100-200 lbs

***Speed***: 30ft

***Legacy of Knowledge (+)***: When you make an ability check involving either Intelligence or Charisma, you can choose to apply double your proficiency bonus instead of whatever level of proficiency (including none at all) would normally apply. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.

On a failure, the target makes attack rolls against you at disadvantage and their attitude increases by one step (hostile -> indifferent -> friendly) for the duration of the interaction. 

In combat, targets that fail can repeat their saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. Creatures that succeed on their saving throw or for whom the effect ends cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.

***Small***: You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

***Diminutive Target***: When you gain cover against an attack from another creature, it counts as 3/4 cover, not half cover.

#### Dragonborn, True

***Size***: Medium. 5'0" - 6'6", 110-300 lbs

***Breath Weapon(+)***. You can use your bonus action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation. Alternatively, you can use this ability in place of a weapon attack from the Attack action.

When you use your breath weapon, each creature must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

After you use your breath weapon, you canâ€™t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

***Draconic Ancestry***: Choose a color from the Elemental Affinity table and gain resistance to the related damage type. If you have the Breath Weapon feature, this also sets the damage type, saving throw, and shape of the breath weapon.

**Elemental Affinity**
|Color|Damage Type (Description)|Saving Throw|Shape|
|:---:|:----------|:-----------|:----|
|Black|Necrotic (Green-tinged black vapor)|Constitution|20' cone|
