<h3 class="subsection">Sample Backgrounds</h3>
<h4 class="subsub">Aristocrat</h4>
<div class="background-block">
	<div><b>Proficiencies</b>: History, Persuasion, one gambling set, land or water vehicles</div>
	<div><b>Languages</b>: Any language of your choice</div>
	<div><b>Items</b>: A set of fine clothes, a signet ring with your house's seal, a pouch containing 15 gp</div>
	<div><b>Skill Trick</b>: <a href="skill-tricks.html#diplomat">Diplomat</a> or <a href="skill-tricks.html#scholar-history">Scholar: History</a></div>
</div>

<p>True nobles are rare in the Federated Nations--the noble houses are few and far between and mostly very small--and not generally suited for adventuring. But aristocrats (formal or informal, hereditary or not), the scions of landed gentry, rich merchant princes, influential families, etc? Those are many, even in the more egalitarian nations. And second and third children often make a name for themselves as adventurers.</p>

<h5>Questions to consider</h5>
<ul>
	<li>What role did your family play in the nation you grew up in? Did they have a formal title or just significant influence? Maybe they had an old name, but had fallen on hard times?</li>
	<li>Are you still in good favor with your family? Or are you estranged?</li>
	<li>Is there anyone trying to get you to return and play a bigger role in the family affairs? Are you running from any arranged marriages?</li>
	<li>How do you view the "common folk"? How familiar are you with their ways and traditions? How cloistered in your high status were you?</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="subsub">Crafter</h4>
<div class="background-block">
	<div><b>Proficiencies</b>: Investigation, two crafting tools of your choice</div>
	<div><b>Languages</b>: Dwarven</div>
	<div><b>Items</b>: A set of crafting tools you are proficient in, 10gp of materials for that work, and a pouch containing 15 gp</div>
	<div><b>Skill Trick</b>: <a href="skill-tricks.html#craft-apprentice">Craft Apprentice</a></div>
</div>

<p>Most of the Federated Nations works on a guild apprenticeship basis, with individual crafters learning under masters and striking out on their own to provide services. You were one of those crafters.</p>

<h5>Questions to consider</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Did you complete your apprenticeship? If not, is your master still looking for you? If so, what is your relationship with your former master?</li>
	<li>Are you a member in good standing with any of the crafting guilds? If not, are you at odds with any?</li>
	<li>What variety of crafting did you do (e.g. fine metal work, pots, structural metal, armor/weapon smithing, etc)?</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="subsub">Criminal</h4>
<div class="background-block">
	<div><b>Proficiencies</b>: Intimidation OR Deception, Stealth, Thieves tools</div>

	<div><b>Items</b>: Thieves tools, a set of dark clothing, and a pouch containing 15 gp</div>
	<div><b>Skill Trick</b>: <a href="skill-tricks.html#misdirect">Misdirect</a> OR <a href="skill-tricks.html#feint">Feint</a></div>
</div>

<p>Criminal organizations, as well as individuals who live and operate outside the law, are common throughout the lands of the Federated Nations. The city state of Rauviz and the oligarchy of Asai'ka are most notorious for harboring criminal organizations, but "guilds" are present in most areas. Before you were an adventurer, you lived such a life.</p>

<h5>Questions to Consider</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Were you part of an organized group? Or a freelancer?</li>
	<li>What was your specialty? Armed thuggery? Muscle? A pick-pocket? A confidence-man? A smuggler?</li>
	<li>Do you still have connections with the underground where you came from? Are they friendly? Or did you flee in haste? If so, why?</li>
	<li>What did you do that you regretted, if anything? What secrets do you have that might come back to bite you or your party?</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="subsub">Entertainer</h4>
<div class="background-block">
	<div><b>Proficiencies</b>: Acrobatics, Performance, Disguise Kit, one musical instrument of your choice</div>
	<div><b>Languages</b>: One common language of your choice</div>
	<div><b>Items</b>: A disguise kit, a set of performers clothes, a musical instrument, and a pouch containing 10 gp</div>
	<div><b>Skill Trick</b>: <a href="skill-tricks.html#tumble">Tumble</a></div>
</div>

<p>Entertainers are minstrels, traveling players, actors, actresses, temple dancers, street performers, etc. They often move from place to place in search of work and new audiences.</p>

<h5>Questions to Consider</h5>
<ul>
	<li>What kind of entertainer were you?</li>
	<li>Were you part of a troupe or band, or were you solo?</li>
	<li>What kinds of audiences did you favor? The common folk in taverns? Busking for coins on the street? The high society parties?</li>
	<li>Was there any particular person or people you had drama with?</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="subsub">Farmer</h4>
<div class="background-block">
	<div><b>Proficiencies</b>: Animal Handling, Survival, Nature, one crafting tool of your choice or Land Vehicles</div>
	<div><b>Languages</b>: One common language of your choice</div>
	<div><b>Items</b>: A small pet (CR 0) such as a dog, cat, or squirrel that will do simple tricks, a pouch containing 5 gp</div>
	<div><b>Skill Trick</b>: <a href="skill-tricks.html#soothe-domesticated-animal">Soothe Domesticated Animal</a> OR (if proficient in a crafting tool) <a href="skill-tricks.html#craft-apprentice">Craft Apprentice</a></div>
</div>

<p>The majority of the population of the Federated Nations is involved in farming or livestock handling to one degree or another. Without the rural folks, no one eats. Not even the greatest. You were part of that agricultural backbone...until you took up the adventuring life.</p>

<h5>Questions to Consider</h5>
<ul>
	<li>What did you or your family/village specialize in? Livestock? Grains? Did you have an orchard?</li>
	<li>What kind of village or town did you live in? Maybe an isolated hamlet of a few dozen souls? maybe the outskirts of a large city?</li>
	<li>Where did you get the resources and learning to pursue your adventuring career? A armsman might have inherited the sword and armor from an ancestor, etc.</li>
	<li>Do you still have family back on the farm? Were they ok with you leaving?</li>
	<li>What were you known for as a youth? Any particular events stand out?</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="subsub">Merchant</h4>
<div class="background-block">
	<div><b>Proficiencies</b>: Deception or Persuasion, Insight, land vehicles, one gambling set of your choice</div>
	<div><b>Languages</b>: One common language of your choice</div>
	<div><b>Items</b>: A book, a quill pen, and ink. A pouch containing 20 gp</div>
	<div><b>Skill Trick</b>: <a href="skill-tricks.html#diplomat">Diplomat</a> OR <a href="skill-tricks.html#haggler">Haggler</a></div>
</div>

<p>Merchants run the gamut from the great merchant princes of Rauviz or Asai'ka to the humble traveling peddlers wandering among the settlements on the fringes of the known world. Before taking up adventuring, you were living this life, trading goods produced by others for coin.</p>

<h5>Questions to Consider</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Were you a solo practitioner? Part of a family business? Or part of a larger conglomerate?</li>
	<li>What did your business specialize in, if anything? Were you a purveyor of particular goods or a general peddler? What kind of customers were your norm?</li>
	<li>What contacts do you still have?</li>
	<li>What kind of reputation did you have? A fair dealer, accepted if not liked? A fly-by-night operator? Someone who could find what the customer wants...at a price? A shady, high pressure operator?</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="subsub">Sailor</h4>
<div class="background-block">
	<div><b>Proficiencies</b>: Perception, Survival, water vehicles and cartographer's tools</div>
	<div><b>Languages</b>: Thieves Cant</div>
	<div><b>Items</b>: A compass, a dagger, a pouch containing 10gp</div>

</div>

<p>The Federated Nations is mostly landlocked. Four major bodies of water, plus a selection of riverine routes are the major outlets for the sailing dreams of mortalkind. The cold and misty Sea of Dreams to the north, the placid, freshwater, and deep Lake Coy'in (more the size of an inland sea), the shallow and stormy Gap-tooth Bay near Byssia, and the pirate-infested, island-dotted tropical Moon Sea south of the Jungle of Fangs. Each one has their own maritime tradition. You were crew aboard a ship, or maybe a solo fisherman.</p>

<h5>Questions to Consider</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Was your ship a large cargo vessel, a fast courier, or a fishing boat?</li>
	<li>Was the business of your ship entirely above-board? Or was smuggling a factor?</li>
	<li>What's your ship doing now?</li>
	<li>Were you willingly part of that life? Or were you snatched up and bound to service?</li>
	<li>Was your ship one big family or wer the captain and officers tyrants? Or maybe you were a tyrant?</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="subsub">Scholar</h4>
<div class="background-block">
	<div><b>Proficiencies</b>: two of Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion</div>
	<div><b>Languages</b>: Any two languages of your choice</div>
	<div><b>Items</b>: A quill, ink pot, and a notebook, a pouch containing 10 gp</div>
	<div><b>Skill Trick</b>: <a href="skill-tricks.html#linguist">Linguist</a> OR a Scholar skill trick for one of the proficiencies you picked.</div>
</div>

<p>Many of the nations have a scholarly tradition, although not all have an <em>academic</em> tradition. Some scholars are bound up in a library, such as the Four Towers just outside Crisial City, others wander. Many, if not most, scholars have some association with the Sages Guild, the international union of "civilized" scholars. For some, however, that association is negative--they reject the hidebound and conservative traditions of the Sages.</p>

<h5>Questions to Consider</h5>
<ul>
	<li>What was your specialty? The history of nations? Natural sciences? Arcana? The planes beyond? The practical matters of alchemy? Something even more esoteric or forbidden?</li>
	<li>What is your relationship with the Sages Guild? A member in good standing? An outcast? Something in between?</li>
	<li>If you were cloistered in a library or laboratory...what brought you out of that life? If you were a wanderer...what made you take up your particular practices (your class)?</li>
	<li>Do you have a reputation in the scholarly community?</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="subsub">Shrine-keeper</h4>
<div class="background-block">
	<div><b>Proficiencies</b>: Religion, Persuasion, Wood-carver's tools</div>
	<div><b>Languages</b>: Sylvan OR Lucian</div>
	<div><b>Items</b>: A set of vestments, a holy symbol, and a pouch containing 10 gp</div>
	<div><b>Skill Trick</b>: <a href="skill-tricks.html#scholar-religion">Scholar: Religion</a> OR <a href="skill-tricks.html#diplomat">Diplomat</a></div>
</div>

<p>Shrine-keeper, priest, cleric, wise one, witch. Those that tend to the shrines of the Ascendants and kami that dot the landscape have many names. Most have no particular gifts of power; those that do often take up a calling like that of the priest class. But the number of those that simply tend the shrines, participating in the veneration and worship while not having an official standing with the Power in question, is legion. You were among that latter number whether by birth or choice.</p>

<h5>Questions to Consider</h5>
<ul>
	<li>What kind of shrine did you serve at? A small obscure rural shrine to a kami? Or a major temple in the heart of a city? Or maybe a private shrine frequented by the powerful?</li>
	<li>Were you part of a larger group of keepers and priests? Or was this your duty alone?</li>
	<li>Did you choose this life? Or was it thrust upon you by family obligations?</li>
	<li>Do you still have faith in that Power? What's your relationship with Them now?</li>
	<li>What event made you leave the service of the shrine and take up the life of a wandering adventurer? An oracle from your Power? Or the destruction/desecration of the shrine? Or maybe just a desire for a new life?</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="subsub">Soldier</h4>
<div class="background-block">
	<div><b>Proficiencies</b>: Athletics, Medicine, one game set, smiths' tools</div>

</div>

<p>Most of the Federated Nations don't have large standing armies--it's been a time of peace for quite a while. Wyrmhold is the key exception. But they all have militias of one sort or another, and every nation has specialist forces such as Crisial's Scout Corps or the March Wardens of Byssia. There are also many private guard companies (mercenary companies by another name) doing caravan and local security, as well as private "armies" of the various wealthy and/or aristocratic families, as well as the clan guards common in the more tribal areas. You served in one of these groups.</p>

<h5>Questions to Consider</h5>
<ul>
	<li>What kind of organization did you serve with?</li>
	<li>Were you just a grunt or were you an officer?</li>
	<li>What role did you play in that organization?</li>
	<li>Did you leave on good terms? Or did you leave under a cloud (earned or not)?</li>
	<li>Were there any particular (small-scale) actions you participated in?</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="subsub">Street Kid</h4>
<div class="background-block">
	<div><b>Proficiencies</b>: Perception, Stealth OR Intimidation, thieves tools, one gambling set of your choice</div>
	<div><b>Languages</b>: Thieves Cant</div>
	<div><b>Items</b>: A gambling set, thieves tools, a pouch containing 5 gp</div>

</div>

<p>Every city and substantial town has those who fall through the cracks. Kids, especially, who grow up among the poor and lack stable homes. Not all of them are orphans, but all of them share the desperate struggle for day-to-day survival. Working odd jobs, stealing food, joining a street gang, begging--these are the occupations of such children. You were part of that life, but unlike most, you broke out and gained enough training to adventure.</p>

<h5>Questions to Consider</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Were you an orphan? Why did you end up on the streets?</li>
	<li>How did you survive? Did you try to play by the rules, or were you part of the underground (even if unofficially)? Were you part of a gang?</li>
	<li>How did you gain the training and resources for your class? Was there a kind (or cruel!) mentor or benefactor? A happy accident? A particularly big score?</li>
	<li>What kind of a town did you grow up in? Was it a big city? A medium-sized town?</li>
</ul>
