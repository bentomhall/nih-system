		<h2 class="section">Monstrosities</h2>
		<p>Monstrosities are the catch-all category for things that aren't shaped roughly like a person. Does it speak but look like a <a href=beasts.html>beast</a>? Does it have magical abilities but not fit into another category? Was it created by a mage in a long-ago day but now breed normally? Then it's probably a monstrosity.</p>
		<h2>Ankheg</h2>
		<p>The Ankheg, aka tunnel worm, aka rancher's bane, is a dangerous pest common to the temperate plains regions of Quartus. They create large burrows and holes that horses and cattle break their legs in...when the ankheg aren't rising up and devouring said horses and cattle. They have an acid spit that can dissolve flesh and bone and their main mandibles grab and tear. Their plates are hard--various metal-scarce folks such as the Hevonen (aka Horse Clans) of the Lupaus Plain have been known to fashion them into breastplates. A talented leatherworker might be able to fashion an item that resists acid damage out of them.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> For anyone who grew up in or around the plains, ankheg and their nature are common knowledge.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Ankheg are mostly found on temperate plains. They come in swarms of 2d4-1.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Ankheg are ambush predators, preferring to stay burrowed until they detect edible creatures close by, and then rising to attack. They spit acid and then move in for the kill.</p>

			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Spit.</b></p>
				<p>The ankheg spits acid in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide, provided that it has no creature grappled. Each creature in that line must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Basilisk</h2>
		<p>The basilisk, with its six legs, four eyes (in pairs on each side of the elongated, crocodilian snout), and petrifying gaze is a feared predator. Thankfully it is quite unintelligent and can be tricked by shiny objects.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> The basilisk is not common outside areas such as the Bloodthirst Wildlands and the Great Eastern Dustlands, but its fame has spread. Most characters recognize them immediately, but the secrets to its gaze (including exact range) require a scholarly background, a ranger's lifestyle, or a successfully Intelligence (Nature) check.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Basilisks make dens in caves near water, usually in ravines and hill country. A den of basilisks is often a mated pair with possibly some young at certain times of year.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Basilisks try to get close enough to petrify their foes. Other than that, they tend to be straightforward predators. Their lack of speed means they tend to lie in wait until foes are close and then pounce.</p>

			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Petrifying Gaze.</b></p>
				<p>If a creature other than the basilisk's mate starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the <a href="../spells/incantations.html#restoration">restoration</a> incantation (greater only) or other magic.</p>
				<p>A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn and treats it as an unseen target (disadvantage to hit with attacks, and the basilisk has advantage to hit the creature), when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</p>
				<p>If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.</p>

		<h2>Behir</h2>
		<p>Said to have been created by titans during the First Age as hunting partners against the Wyrm during their wars, a small population of them has survived in the wild. Intensely anti-social and imbued with a hatred of everything draconic, they lair individually and despoil livestock and prey on all sorts of creatures. While they pretend to be anti-dragon, they do also succumb to some of the same hoarding instincts and can sometimes be bribed to allow passage, especially if you claim to be hunting dragons.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Obscure. No one who has not studied them in particular knows anything about them, and even students of dragon and titan legends must succeed on an Intelligence (History) check.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Behir are only found in the wastelands of the northern Dragonreach. When encountered, they are nearly always alone. They lair in twisting caverns high enough for them to hide above enemies.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> The behir use their climbing speed to gain the advantage, often blasting with their lightning breath before descending to do battle. They attempt to swallow foes where possible and then retreat, picking off the enemy with hit and run attacks. They will generally prioritize anyone speaking Draconic or who looks related to dragons (including dragonborn).</p>

			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Multiattack.</b></p>
				<p>The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.</p>

			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6).</b></p>
				<p></p>
				<p>The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Swallow.</b></p>
				<p>The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.</p>
				<p>If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.</p>

		<h2>Blink Dogs</h2>
		<p>These are dogs, infused with Shadow energy. Named for its ability to teleport short distances. Shy and evasive, but loyal if befriended. Human-level intelligence.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Rare, but not unknown.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Kami-heavy forested areas. Sometimes they will work with ihmisi or orc groups.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Blink dogs will only attack if they or their allies are threatened. Otherwise, they'll teleport away from danger where possible.</p>

		<h2>Chimera</h2>
		<p>A three-headed combination of an enlarged, bat-winged lion with a dragon's head and a goat's head on either shoulder (mounted on snake-like necks), the chimera is both puzzling and extremely dangerous. Known for their ravenous appetites and extremely stupid behavior, chimeras are a scourge whenever they appear. Especially since the dragon head can breathe a cone of fire.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Chimeras are widely-known but rare, mostly because they're hunted down whenever they show up lest they eat everything in sight. No checks are necessary to identify them.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Chimeras keep to the wilds. Most of the known populations live in the mountains between the Giant-Spine range and the Ladyfrost range near Shinevog, although the prime nests aren't known.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Chimeras are stupid. They prefer to charge in, breathe fire, and start attacking whoever irritates them most. If injured, they'll usually try to flee with their superior flight speed. They especially like eating horses and cattle, preferentially attacking them over people (who tend to have sharp things).</p>

		<h2>Chuul</h2>
		<p>The chuul were once lobsters, now twisted by biological magics into servants of the comiedar and the mkhulu. Some free populations exist where their masters were destroyed or abandoned them. Standing on four legs with an upright posture, like a lobster-human hybrid, they use the long tentacles coming from their mouth region and their claws to carry prey back for consumption or experimentation by their masters. Their tentacles carry a paralytic venom. They are also quite sensitive to active magic and use it to home in on interesting prey.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Rare. These are unknown by any but the most dedicated scholars of the sea-tyrants.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Found underwater near mkhulu settlements and occasionally on land in flooded or marshy areas. They rarely travel far from the sea. They are found in company of mkhulu, comeidar, or their servants, and often in groups of 2-5. Free nests tend to have half a dozen or so adults.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> When serving sea tyrants, they are tasked to bring back certain individuals, usually spell-casters, and will do so relentlessly. When hunting for food, they take easy prey and drag them back underwater to drown and be eaten.</p>

			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Tentacles.</b></p>
				<p>One creature grappled by the chuul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is stunned.

		<h2>Cloaker</h2>
		<p>So named because of its resemblance to a large cloak as it flutters down from the ceiling of a cave onto someone's head, the cloaker is a monstrous creature found underground. Warped by ancient wild magic, it is intelligent enough to communicate via telepathic image projection, even though it cannot speak. Feared by the goroesi of Moon's Vengeance as "the moaning death in the dark", cloakers are virtually unknown outside that blasted region.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Virtually unknown. Their existence is not found in any lore of the main parts of the Noefran continent.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Tunnels and caves of Moon's Vengeance and very occasionally the Inner Barrier Range. Found alone or using things like grick as stalking horses.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Cloakers hang from the ceiling, virtually invisible while motionless. They drop onto the heads of their targets and latch on, gnawing at them. It uses its tail against that creature or against others nearby, and uses Moan and Phantasms to protect itself. Cloakers can be reasoned with, mostly by bribing them with easier targets. If seriously threatened, they will detach and flee. They often save Moan to allow an easier escape.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="monster-attack"><b>Bite.</b> <em>Melee Weapon Attack.</em> <em>+6 to hit, range 5 ft.</em> <em>Hit:</em> 2d6 + 3 piercing, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.</p>
			<p class="monster-attack"><b>Tail.</b> <em>Melee Weapon Attack.</em> <em>+6 to hit, range 10 ft.</em> <em>Hit:</em> 1d8 + 3 slashing </p>
			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Moan.</b></p>
				<p>Each creature other than a cloaker within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become shaken until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If the result is 8 or lower, they are frightened instead. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours</p>
			</div>
			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).</b></p>
				<p>The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.</p>
				<p>Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.</p>
				<p>A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.</p>

		<h2>Cockatrice</h2>
		<p>Chicken-like monsters with a petrifying bite. Why they exist, and how they feed on stone (without a basilisk's acidic saliva) is quite unknown. Most scholars blame the Twisted or one of his followers for coming up with this one--it's too bizarre even to blame on mages or the aelvar, the two most common suspects whenever a weird creature is discovered.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Cockatrice nests have been discovered throughout Noefra. They are fairly widely-known. Some believe that they are spontaneous mutations of chickens, but there is wide disagreement.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Anywhere chickens can be found. Usually found in flocks of 5-10.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Swarm and peck. Flee if damaged or panicked. That's about all they can manage. They're not particularly bright (like the chickens they resemble).</p>

		<h2>Darkmantle</h2>
		<p>This creature is akin to a smaller, stupider, less-dangerous cloaker. They fall from the ceiling onto people and attempt to crush them. Unlike the cloaker, they cannot talk or be reasoned with.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Virtually unknown outside Moon's Vengeance. Some fragmentary reports from the Uulani Confederacy say that they have reached at least that far north.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Underground tunnels and caves. Usually found in clusters and packs, often working with ropers or other ambush predators.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Darkmantles are ambush predators, preferring to drop from hiding onto someone and crush the life out of them. They use their Darkness Aura ability to cover their escape if damaged or to blind their foes.</p>

		<h2>Doppelganger</h2>
		<p></p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Rumors of dopplegangers abound, but most of them are false. An Intelligence (Arcana) check gives more information.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Dopplegangers are native to the plane of Clay, one of the Earth-aspected elemental planes, where they form a normal part of society. Elsewhere, they tend to be hired as spies, actors, prostitutes, and assassins. Only rarely are they found in groups with other doppelgangers, but they frequently are in cahoots with other mortals.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Dopplegangers aren't keen on combat. They prefer to infiltrate and escape. When tasked to assassinate targets, they seek to gain surprise in the hope that their Surprise Attack will finish the job. If not, they tend to attempt to flee.</p>

				<p>The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p>

		<h2>Ettercap</h2>
		<p>The ettercap is a horrifying amalgam of humanoid and spider traits. Originally created by acolytes of the Twisted, a small breeding population exists in the Bloodthirst Wildlands among other remote areas. While they look (mostly) humanoid, they are not Spoken and operate on animal instinct only.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Ettercap are known only to the residents of their native areas. A few depictions exist in rare books, but they are filled with guesses and interpolations.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Ettercap live in corrupted forests and caves, usually in and around nests of Giant Spiders or other such spider types. Usually one or two ettercap and a large number of spiders.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Ettercap act like spiders, attempting to surprise from above and use their web to entangle enemies. They rarely finish off their foes, preferring to incapacitate them and slowly drain them of life over days or weeks of feeding.</p>

		<h2>Grick</h2>
		<p>The grick is an ugly worm-like segmented creature about 6 feet long when fully grown. It has four fleshy, octopus-like tentacles surrounding a hard beak, but no visible eyes (although it is not blind). Its coloration blends into rocky terrain. Most theories suggest that they were spawned by demonic meddling, probably that of the Twisted or his acolytes. However, they are natural creatures at this point.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Rare. Only fragmentary reports of grick exist outside of Moon's Vengeance, although some adventurers reported that a colony of hive-minded grick and other creatures live under part of Godsfall. Intelligence (Nature) gives information.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Grick live underground in areas heavy with rampant magic and demonic corruption, although they themselves are not demonic. They tend to come in nests of 2-10 adults.<p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b>Grick are nearly mindless and attack the nearest target. They will run away if injured, as they are mostly predatory beasts. Some other monstrosities have been known to tame them as attack animals.</p>

		<h2>Griffon</h2>
		<p>The noble-appearing griffon, with its eagle's forequarters and lion's hind-quarters, is known all over Noefra. The dwarves of the southern Jungle of Fangs tame them as mounts, as do various other groups. Wild griffons prey on herd animals, preferring unattended cows and horses. Kits can be tamed and will generally imprint on a single rider, although expert trainers can transfer the bond to some degree. Unlike most non-standard mounts, their bone structure accommodates a saddle fairly easily.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Common. It's rare for someone not to recognize them.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Mountains and hills all over Quartus, especially near open rolling plains. Usually found as a mated pair for adults, sometimes with kits.<p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Griffons are hit and run predators, preferring to strike from the sky and drag off their foes. They will only fight to the death when protecting their nests. They do recognize bows and crossbows and will avoid those where possible.</p>

		<h2>Harpy</h2>
		<p>Harpies are a rare species of monstrosity known to inhabit many of the waste and fringe lands of Noefra and other continents. They are roughly a cross between a goblinoid torso, arms/hands (although clawed) and upper legs and head and a vulture's wings and lower legs/claws. The males of the species, called bloodhawks, are rarer than the females and have raptorial beaks as well; the females have fully goblinoid heads but sharpened carnivore teeth. Both sexes have aggressively exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics and external genitalia. They are obligate carnivores, although like dogs they can eat small amounts of grains and other vegetable matter. They are often territorial, cowardly, and aggressive, with bad tempers. Some exceptions exist.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Uncommon, but well-known. Their song is widely known among adventurers.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Hills and mountains, especially near the Bloodthirst Wildlands and the Eastern Dustlands. Usually found in groups of 2 or more.<p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Female harpies will try to lure people and animals close...or off cliffs with their song. If the song fails or the enemies look strong, the harpies will generally try to break off contact unless protecting their nests. Bloodhawks are more physically aggressive and will attack those that aren't charmed. Harpies have been known to use creatures like basilisks as hazards, luring people into range of the basilisk and then sharing the spoils.</p>

			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Luring Song.</b></p>
				<p>The harpy sings a magical melody. Every beast, monstrosity, humanoid, or giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.</p>
				<p>While charmed by the harpy, a target cannot take any actions and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.</p>
				<p>A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24 hours.</p>

		<h2>Hydra</h2>
		<p>The multi-headed hydra is legendary...but sadly not only a legend. With their multiple heads, regeneration (including regrowing heads), and extreme hunger (many mouths to feed, even if it's all the same stomach), they're a serious danger whenever encountered. In some elementally-charged areas there have been reports of hydras capable of breathing cold, fire, or poison. Thankfully, hydras are not smart like dragons.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Rare, but well-attested. Variants are rumored but not known. Intelligence (Nature) to determine if it's a variant.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Swamps, bogs, and marshes. Their large bodies need flotation. Rarely found in company of other monsters of size Medium or larger, since it tends to treat Small creatures as not worth eating.<p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> No tactics. Charge and eat. Remember to use its multiple reactions and extended reach.</p>

		<h2>Land Shark</h2>
		<p>The land shark, also known as a bulette or "that abyss-spawned armored <em>thing</em>" are a nasty danger in the Lupaus Plains and most of the hill lands throughout Noefra. Thankfully they've been hunted out of more settled areas by adventurers. Like an overgrown basilisk, they have six legs and a vaguely reptilian look. They lack the petrifying stare, but are covered in tough chitinous armor plates like an overgrown armadillo. They have a heavy toothed beak, which is their primary offense. With their burrowing capabilities and tough armor, they lurk underground and try to surprise animals...and people. What is less obvious about them is that they also have prodigiously-strong legs, letting them leap onto foes.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>

		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Hills and plains away from settlements, mostly. Rarely in groups of more than 2 (a mated pair).</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Land sharks have one basic strategy--lurk and pounce. They try to stay underground until their tremorsense picks up edible targets, then they surface and pounce. If they're not in melee, they'll try to use Deadly Leap to get on top of someone. They primarily attack out of hunger and will drag bodies underground for later eating.</p>

			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Standing Leap.</b></p>

			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Deadly Leap.</b></p>
				<p>If the land shark jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 14 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone and take 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked prone, and is pushed 5 feet out of the land shark's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone in the land shark's space.</p>

		<h2>Manticore</h2>
		<p>Another "what insane person thought that would be a good idea" creation, variously attributed to acolytes of the Twisted and aelven bio-mages, the manticore is like a winged lion with a number of fast-growing, detatchable spines on its tail. It can throw these spines to great effect. Manticores can speak and can often be bought off with bribes of food (which they prefer to be in the form of fresh meat). Like giant cats, however, they usually have a perverse sense of humor and an insatiable curiosity.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Uncommon. Intelligence (Nature) is usually the appropriate check.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Found in mountainous areas and other places where game is plentiful and they can circle and pounce.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> They will generally try to soften up their prey from a distance with their tail spikes, closing after it is wounded or if the enemy starts fighting back with ranged attacks. They recognize and particularly dislike archers and mages and will chase them around the map. Like cats, they like to play with their food.</p>

		<h2>Medusa</h2>
		<p>Medusae are, thankfully, rare. The result of particular curses, usually demonic in origin, these women have snakes for hair and the uncontrollable power to petrify any creature that meets their eyes. Thus, those that interact with others wear heavy veils or blindfolds, relying on their hearing for perception. Note that the curse they are subject to is not removable by <a href="../spells/allspells.html#remove-curse">remove curse</a> or other such abilities--it's become part of them. The curse is often family-linked, affecting the women of some bloodlines. While the medusa presented here is not a spell-caster, many of them learn illusion magic, mostly to hide their curse.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Extremely rare. Intelligence (Arcana) is the appropriate check to learn more about their cursed nature.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Often jungles, but in principle anywhere. Rarely where there are large numbers of people.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Medusae try to stay at range and petrify their foes when forced into combat (or acting out of malice). They try to avoid polished surfaces, although oddly natural reflective surfaces do not trigger their self-petrification.</p>

			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Petrifying Gaze.</b></p>
				<p>When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the <a href="../spells/incantations.html#restoration">restoration</a> (greater only).</p>
				<p>Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.</p>
				<p>If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.</p>

			<h3>Actions</h3>

		<h2>Mimic</h2>
		<p>Why isn't the mimic an ooze? Who knows. Where did they come from? Someone with a sick sense of humor. Probably the Twisted. A corruption of the naturally-protean entities from the planes of mud and clay, these are archetypal dungeon dangers. Taking the form of a medium object that people will naturally interact with such as a door, chest, table, or other such object, they adhere to whoever touches them and then use their toothed maw to devour their prey. Some have speculated that mimics might be able to be trained, but few are foolhardy enough to try. Others have spread rumors of gigantic mimics capable of taking on the shape of a room or even an entire building...let us hope those are not true.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Uncommon. Intelligence (Nature or Arcana) is the appropriate check.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Places where unlucky creatures, especially humanoids, are likely to come. But that aren't frequented. Rarely-used cellars, ruins, underground vaults and tunnels, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> They stay motionless until something touches them, then strike. They do not react when attacked from range in their object form, as they've learned that adventurers get paranoid fast.</p>

		<h2>Nagas</h2>
		<p>The guardian and spirit nagas represent two snake-like creatures, originally created to act as protectors and nemesis figures, respectively. They represent the polar opposites of the astral--radiant and beneficent and necrotic and destructive. The few naga known to exist are mainly found in the Jungle of Fangs and Bloodthirst Wildlands, where they act as living deific figures to many of the ophidian tribes.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Legendary.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b>Jungle ruins, especially the Jungle of Fangs, Bloodthirst Wildlands, and Great Rift.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b>Both types prefer to cast spells until forced into melee, at which point they lay to with their bite. Guardian naga will act supportively of their allies, while spirit naga are more directly offensive. </p>
