	<p>A black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 necrotic damage and deals only half damage with weapon attacks until the spell ends.</p>

	<p>At the end of each of the target's turns, it can make a Constitution saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends.</p>

	<p><b>Overcast</b> When you cast this spell using more than 3 AET, the damage increases by 1d8 for every 2 additional aether spent.</p>

	<p>A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.</p>

	<p>The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>

	</div>
	<p>You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body.</p>

	<p>If the target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.</p>

	<p>The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature's race to change. The GM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to determine what form the creature takes when restored to life, or the GM chooses a form.</p>
	<table>

	<p>The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original lineage for the new one and changes its lineage traits accordingly. Its culture does not change.</p>

	<p>At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.</p>

<div class="spell-card" id="resilient-sphere">

		<div class="duration">Concentration, up to 1 minute</div>
	</div>
	<p>A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.</p>

	<p>Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage from outside the sphere, and a creature or object inside can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside it. Unwilling targets inside can attack the sphere as an object with AC 17, damage threshold 10, and 16 HP. When it reaches 0 HP, the spell ends and the globe vanishes.</p>

	<p>The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature's speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.</p>

	</div>
	<p>You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends.</p>

	<p>You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.</p>

	</div>
	<p>Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw and you do not need a clear path to the target.</p>

	<p>The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>

	</div>
	<p>You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.</p>

	<p>If the warded creature makes an attack, deals damage, or casts a spell that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.</p>

	<p>You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.</p>

	<p>Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.</p>

	<p><b>Overcast</b> When you cast this spell using more than 3 AET, you create one additional ray for every 3 additional AET you spend.</p>

	</div>
	<p>A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>

	<p>A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.</p>

	<p><b>Overcast</b> When you cast this spell using more than 3 AET, the damage increases by 1d8 for every 2 additional AET spent.</p>

	</div>
	<p>An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. For the duration, you take no damage from <em>magic missile</em>. Additionally, you can take the Deflect action as if you were wearing a shield, spending AET instead of STA to do so.</p>

</div>
<div class="spell-card" id="shield-of-faith">
	<div class="spell-header">

		<div class="duration">Concentration, up to 10 minutes</div>
	</div>
	<p>A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration. This does not stack with a shield.</p>

		<div class="cast-time">1 bonus action</div>
		<div class="targets">1 club or quarterstaff/Touch</div>
		<div class="duration">1 minute</div>
	</div>
	<p>The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature's power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn't already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.</p>

	</div>
	<p>Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.</p>

	<p>The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).</p>

<div class="spell-card" id="silence">

		<div class="targets">20-ft-radius sphere/120 feet</div>
		<div class="duration">Concentration, up to 10 minutes</div>
	</div>
	<p>For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.</p>

<div class="spell-card" id="silent-image">
	<div class="spell-header">

		<div class="cast-time">1 action</div>
		<div class="targets">--/60 feet</div>
		<div class="duration">Concentration, up to 10 minutes</div>
	</div>
	<p>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.</p>

	<p>You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.</p>

	<p>Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.</p>

		<div class="duration">Concentration, up to 1 minute</div>
	</div>
	<p>This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Up to 5 creatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. Creatures who fail their saving throw fall unconscious until the spell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake.</p>

	<p>Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected by this spell.</p>

	<p><b>Overcast</b> When you cast this spell and expend more than 2 AET, the number of affected creatures increases by one for every 3 additional AET spent.</p>

	</div>
	<p>Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.</p>

	<p>The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.</p>

	<p>If a creature is concentrating in the spell's area, the creature must make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.</p>

	</div>
	<p>You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.</p>

	<p>An affected target's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.</p>

	<p>If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.</p>

	<p>A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.</p>

	</div>
	<p>The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels, up to a total per round of 16d4.</p>

	<p>The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.</p>

	<p>You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. Their appearance is up to you.</p>

	<p>When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. Affected creatures treat the area as difficult terrain, and when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage or 3d8 necrotic damage (your choice when you cast the spell). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.</p>

	<p>You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing (your choice) damage equal to 1d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier.</p>

	<p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.</p>

	<p>The weapon can take whatever form you choose. The damage type should be appropriate for the weapon.</p>

	<p>You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration.</p>

	<p>Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.</p>

	<p>A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.</p>

	<p>You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.</p>

	<p>You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable, as judged by the GM. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act ends the spell.</p>

	<p>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.</p>

	<p>You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you could suggest that an orc stab his leader in the back the next time they're in camp together.</p>

	<p>If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.</p>

On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded by this spell.

	<p>You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.</p>

	<p><b>Creature.</b> You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature's Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.</p>

	<p>On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.</p>

	<p><b>Object.</b> You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.</p>

	<p>If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature's Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.</p>

	<p>You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.</p>

	<p>The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.

	<p>A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.</p>

	<p>If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.</p>

	<p>The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.</p>

	<p>If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.</p>

	<p>The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM's discretion.</p>

	<p>A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement.
