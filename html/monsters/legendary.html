  <div class="monster-action"><p><b>Hold Breath.</b></p>
    <p>The hydra can hold its breath for 1 hour.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="monster-action"><p><b>Multiple Heads.</b></p>
    <p>The hydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the hydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.</p>
    <p>Whenever the hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the hydra dies.</p>
    <p>At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown in this way.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="monster-action"><p><b>Reactive Heads.</b></p>
    <p>For each head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="monster-action"><p><b>Wakeful.</b></p>
    <p>While the hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <div class="monster-action"><p><b>Multiattack.</b></p>
    <p>The hydra makes as many bite attacks as it has heads.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="monster-attack"><b>Bite.</b> <em>Melee Weapon Attack.</em> <em>+7 to hit, range 10 ft.</em> <em>Hit:</em> 1d10 + 5 piercing damage. </p>
  <h3>Variants</h3>
  <div class="monster-action"><p><b>Cryohydra.</b></p>
    <p>Cryohydras gain a breath weapon (recharge 6 unless they have more than 5 heads, in which case recharge 4-6)--as an action, they breath a line of cold 40ft long and 10 ft wide from all their heads. Targets in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 cold damage per head on a failure or half as much on a success. This increases the OR by 3.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="monster-action"><p><b>Pyrohydra.</b></p>
    <p>Pyrohydras gain a breath weapon (recharge 6 unless they have more than 5 heads, in which case recharge 4-6)--as an action, they breath a line of fire 40ft long and 10 ft wide from all their heads. Targets in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage per head on a failure or half as much on a success. This increases the OR by 3. Their regeneration is stopped by cold, not fire.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="monster-action"><p><b>Venom Hydra.</b></p>
    <p>Venom Hydras gain a breath weapon (recharge 6 unless they have more than 5 heads, in which case recharge 4-6)--as an action, they breath a line of poison 40ft long and 10 ft wide from all their heads. Targets in the area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 3d6 poison damage per head on a failure or half as much on a success. This increases the OR by 3.</p>

    <p>The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Actions</h3>
  <div class="monster-action"><p><b>Multiattack.</b></p>
    <p>The kraken makes three tentacle attacks, each of which it can replace with one use of Fling or Bite.</p>
  </div>
  <p class="monster-attack"><b>Bite.</b> <em>Melee Weapon Attack.</em> <em>+17 to hit, range 5 ft.</em> <em>Hit:</em> 3d8 + 10 piercing. If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns. If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone. </p>
  <p class="monster-attack"><b>Tentacle.</b> <em>Melee Weapon Attack.</em> <em>+17 to hit, range 30 ft.</em> <em>Hit:</em> 3d6 + 10 bludgeoning, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target. </p>
  <div class="monster-action"><p><b>Fling.</b></p>
    <p>One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="monster-action"><p><b>Lightning Storm (recharge 5-6).</b></p>
    <p>The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 120 feet of it. A target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
  <p>The Kraken can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Kraken regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
  <div class="monster-action"><p><b>Tentacle Attack or Fling.</b></p>
    <p>The kraken makes one tentacle attack or uses its Fling.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="monster-action"><p><b>Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions).</b></p>
    <p>The kraken uses Lightning Storm.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="monster-action"><p><b>Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions).</b></p>
    <p>While underwater, the kraken expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of the kraken's next turn.</p>
