\subsection{Therianthropes}
Therianthropes, more commonly known as were creatures, stem originally from demonic interference, mostly from the followers of the demon prince known as the Red Fang. But many of the creatures are blameless victims, and there are a substantial number of people who inherited the ability to transform from their cursed ancestors. These entries only describe those capable of passing on the curse via bite, in the main the victims themselves of a cursed bite. Were-creatures may either choose to revel in their blood-lust curse or seek to control it; either way, they remain dangerous.

There are others, called Skinwalkers or Loup Garou, who willingly trafficked with demons to gain power. They are even more powerful, if thankfully rare.

All were creatures possess extreme regenerative capability, being capable of near-instantly regenerating from even mortal wounds. Silvered weapons stop this healing, leaving lasting wounds, and being beheaded once made unconscious also works. Not much else does.

\DndMonsterAction{Cursed Regeneration} The werebear regenerates 20 hit points at the start of each of its turns. It only dies if its maximum hit points reach zero (see Silver Sensitivity) or if someone uses an action to behead it while it is unconscious at zero hit points.

\DndMonsterAction{Silver Sensitivity} Silver's purity is antithetical to the cursed nature of a were creature. As such, damage dealt by silvered weapons reduce the werebear's maximum hit points by an amount equal to the damage dealt. This lasts until the werebear completes a long rest.

\DndMonsterAction{Shapechanger} The werebear can use its action to polymorph into a Large bear-humanoid hybrid or into a Large bear, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size and AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

\DndMonsterAction{Keen Smell} The werebear has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

\DndMonsterAction{Silver Sensitivity} Silver's purity is antithetical to the cursed nature of a were creature. As such, damage dealt by silvered weapons reduce the wereboar's maximum hit points by an amount equal to the damage dealt. This lasts until the wereboar completes a long rest.

\DndMonsterAction{Shapechanger} The wereboar can use its action to polymorph into a boar-humanoid hybrid or into a boar, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

\DndMonsterAction{Charge (Boar or Hybrid Form Only)} If the wereboar moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with its tusks on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

\DndMonsterAction{Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)} If the wereboar takes 14 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.

\DndMonsterAction{Silver Sensitivity} Silver's purity is antithetical to the cursed nature of a were creature. As such, damage dealt by silvered weapons reduce the werewolf's maximum hit points by an amount equal to the damage dealt. This lasts until the werewolf completes a long rest.

\DndMonsterAction{Shapechanger} The werewolf can use its action to polymorph into a wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

\DndMonsterAction{Keen Hearing and Smell} The werewolf has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

\DndMonsterSection{Actions}
The werewolf makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws or spear.
