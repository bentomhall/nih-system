A living campaign setting designed for the Fifth Edition of the world's most popular role-playing game, Dreams of Hope extends and continues the story of Quartus after the Cataclysm.

=== The Cataclysm and its Aftermath ===

250 years ago, a terrible magical cataclysm shattered the continent of Noefra (and most of the world of Quartus). Magic, both arcane and divine, stopped working and the [[Old Gods]] sacrificed themselves in an attempt to keep the world from disintegrating. Even with this sacrifice, storms, earthquakes, and other calamities swept the land. Almost 80% of the population of the continent died either immediately or over the next few years. When the magic returned 50 years later, it was different. New gods had arisen and spell-casters of all types had to re-learn their art. The survivors had retreated to isolated areas, convinced that they alone survived the Cataclysm.

=== A Spark of Hope ===
A little more than 45 years ago, a group of heroes known as the [[Catalysts]] convinced the five major countries of the western half of [[Noefra]] to coordinate their efforts—and so the [[Federated Nations]] council was born. With it came the founding of the [[Adventurer’s Guild]], an international problem-solving organization that handles requests from citizens and governments alike.

For many years, all was well. The fall of the [[Hungering Frost]] in 211 AC gave [[Wyrmhold]] a breath of hope. The [[Devil's Rebellion]] in the southern part of the [[Stone Throne]] was suppressed after adventurers gave advance warning. New cities were founded, including [[Shinevog]] and [[Zhapai Karmap]]. [[Godsfall]] was liberated, letting the [[Archon of Time]] and [[The Redeeming Blades]] ascend. Adventurers made friendly contact through the [[Portal Network]] to [[Ithemba]] on the [[Soefra]]n continent.

=== Rising Tensions ===
By 230 AC, however, the internal stresses on several of the [[Federated Nations]] member states had grown beyond repair. The [[Council Lands]] was especially troubled, but the [[Stone Throne]] suffered discontent as well. In 227 AC, a coup attempt by the deposed [[Guildmasters]] of the former Council Lands led to civil war. That war ended in 230 AC with the [[Treaty of Rauviz]] and the dissolution of the [[Council Lands]] into five nations: the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]], the [[Crisial Kingdom]], the [[Uulan Confederacy]], the [[Free State of Rauviz]], and the [[Duarchy of Kotimaa]]. A few years later, the [[Stone Throne]] disassociated more peacefully into three nations: the [[Sha'slar Autonomous Zone]] in the north, [[Asai'ka]] in the central [[Jungle of Fangs]], and the [[Serpent Dominion]] in the south by [[Lake Thom]]. While Byssia and Wyrmhold did not break up, they have internal tensions of their own and especially tensions between themselves and between themselves and the other nations. 

In this unsettled time were born the [[Registered Companies]]--mercenary adventuring organizations chartered by each nation. Ranging from the large, corporate [[Golden Banner]] company to the strange and obsessive [[Selan's Seekers]] to the quasi-spy organization known as the [[Holy Hands]], these companies employ adventurers of all [[Adventuring Ranks|ranks]] and attitudes. Those adventurers who belong to a company--a requirement of the [[Crystal Spire Protocols]] (CSP)--are titled Registered Adventurers. As a result of all of this, the [[Adventurer’s Guild]] reconfigured itself to provide mainly policing support. They and their Sanctioned Adventurers keep the [[Registered Companies]] in line with the CSP and keep the [[Portal Network]] open and functioning.

=== Registered Adventurers ===
What are Registered Adventurers? In Earth terms, they're something like a cross between a Special Forces team and a private security contractor or mercenary. Their chains of command are loose and once unleashed on an objective they are free to pick their own methods of resolution. Most of their pay comes from what they acquire in the field--they keep what they loot. Their potential for growth can quickly leave them among the most personally powerful individuals as well as quite wealthy and they tend to retire after a few campaigns. Or die. For the risks they face are great. Abandoned temples to unknown gods, dragons' lairs, demon-summoning cults, hideous monsters, deadly traps. These are the everyday challenges facing a Registered Adventurer. Are you up for the challenge?

The playable races of the setting are (sub-races are included unless specifically excluded):

;[[Humans]]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;: Most common race by far. Major populations exist in all nations except [[Wyrmhold]].

;[[Dwarves]]: Common in the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]], [[Shinevog]], and [[Zhapai Karmap]]. Uncommon but not unknown in the [[Serpent Dominion]]. Rare otherwise.

;Elves : [[Puun Ihmisia]] (pronounced poohn ih-ME-si-a, commonly shortened to imisi, aka wood elves) are common in [[Byssia]], the [[Duarchy]], and [[Zhapai Karmap]]. [[Gwerin]] (GOOER-in), aka high elves are only common in the [[Crisial Kingdom]]. As of mid-summer 250 AC, [[goroesi]] (gor-o-ES-i, dark elves) are available for play. All goroesi come through the [[Serpent Dominion]] and must use the statistics noted in that article. Second note: Metsae (wood elven) and [[Yonwach]] (high elven) are different languages. Choose one if you choose Elven as a language.

;[[Halflings]] : Only common in the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]], but present in the [[Crisial Kingdom]] and the [[Sha'slar Autonomous Zone]] as well, especially in agricultural areas. Rare. Strongly matriarchal society--men are comparatively rare.

;[[Half-elves]]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; : Common in [[Byssia]] and all 3 of the nations of the former [[Stone Throne]]. Present in all 5 of the [[Council Lands]] [[Successor States]] but not common.

;[[Orcs|Half-orcs]]&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;: Full-blooded orcs use these stats; half-orcs ''per se'' don't exist. Very common in [[Wyrmhold]] and the [[Duarchy]]. Uncommon or rare elsewhere.

;[[Dragonborn]] (all colors&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;): Rare but more common as adventurers. Very common (dominant, in fact) in [[Wyrmhold]]. Not found elsewhere. Mostly related to one another (small, clannish population). Add Darkvision (60 ft) and can choose either +2 DEX or +2 STR. Breath weapon is a bonus action. 

;[[Plane-touched]] (Homebrew&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;): Elemental plane-touched are mostly from [[Byssia]], although others are starting to pop up elsewhere. Astral plane-touched are rare and most common in the [[Successor States]].

;[[Hobgoblins]] (Homebrew&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;): Either from [[Wyrmhold]] or the [[Windwalker Confederacy]]. Mistrusted by populations where they're not native. Ignore the lore presented in the book.

;[[Ophidian]]s (Homebrew&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;): Humanoids with snake-like influences. Only present in the nations of the [[Jungle of Fangs]]. 2nd-class citizens in [[Asai'ka]].

;[[Soul-forged]] (Homebrew) : Present in southern [[Wyrmhold]] or [[Byssia]]. Very new race, may get startled reactions elsewhere.

;[[Sher-ka]] [sher-KA] (Homebrew&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;): Anthropomorphic cats from [[Ithemba]] on the south continent.

;[[Jazuu]] [JAZZ-oo] (Homebrew&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;): Large, competitive, mountain people related to giants. From [[Zhapai Karmap]] or [[Wyrmhold]].

If you use the [[Player Option--Variant Races| variant race]] option for applicable races (marked with &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), you may choose an extended background from [[Player Option--Regional Backgrounds]].

[1]: Acceptable alternate stats for the astral plane-touched are found in published books; alternate stat blocks for elemental plane-touched are found in the the a free official pdf.

[2]: Acceptable alternate stats for these races are found in various published books.

[3]: Acceptable alternate stats for this race are found in various published books.

[4]: Main stats are found in the [[Player Option--Variant Races]] document.

==== Classes and Archetypes ====
To learn more about the role of the classes (and their NPC equivalents) in Dreams of Hope, see [[Classes and Quartus]]. For a list of allowed classes and archetypes, talk to the GM.

==== Technology and Magic Levels ====
Magic is common, but permanent magic items are rare. There is no general ability to purchase most permanent magical items, although some organizations facilitate purchase of items for their members in good standing (generally limited to Uncommon and Common items). Potions and other consumable magical items are purchasable in the larger cities.

Tool uses from Xanathar's Guide are in play, as are downtime rules.

==== Expectations ====
* Formal alignment is not in force—this goes for NPCs as well. Not all orcs are evil; neither are chromatic dragons (by default anyway).
* Don’t be a jerk. Repeated evil behavior will get your character exiled or killed.
* Build characters that have a reason to be with the group. This is a group game and there is no room for unhelpful loners.
* Keep things PG. Profanity is discouraged. Sexual content will never be explicit (fade-to-black). Violence should never be graphically described.
* PvP actions are forbidden and will not be allowed. This includes passive-aggressive actions and (non-consensual) theft from party members. The only exception is if both people agree to it out of character as well as rules that will be followed and consequences. Either side can say no at any time which vetos that action.

==== House Rules ====
See [[Default Houserules]].

==== Languages ====
Most citizens of the [[Federated Nations]] area speak [[Common]] of one dialect or another. This does not include most goblins or orcs not from [[Wyrmhold]]. All characters start with proficiency in Common. For Elven, choose either high elven or wood elven. For more information, see [[Languages of Western Noefra]]. Note: language is important. I'm fine with people that have a "any language of your choice" feature holding that choice until it's needed (and then locked in once made).

These are the changes I usually make when GM'ing. Other than the racial restrictions these are not setting specific.

== Class Changes ==
UA and homebrew are available on a case-by-case basis except where noted.

=== Barbarian (Path of the Berserker) ===
You may use frenzy up to once per short rest without incurring exhaustion--all subsequent uses cause exhaustion penalties as noted. 

=== Fighting Styles ===
* Protection : Can be used after seeing the roll.

== Spells ==

=== Summoning ===
All spells that summon, create, or animate creatures have the following addition: "Creatures created (or summoned or animated) by this spell cannot use any ability that would allow them to summon, create, or animate other creatures." This is categorical--no summon chains.

I strongly encourage use of Tasha's ''Summon X'' spells over the PHB (and other) ''Conjure X''. If you choose to use the mass-conjure spells, please restrict yourself to either 1 or two creatures. I'll generally let you pick what you get, but please be prepared to run them quickly.

=== Counterspell ===
Xanathar's identification rules (requiring a reaction and an Intelligence (Arcana) check to identify a spell) are in effect. You cannot, generally, hide a spell-casting that has verbal or somatic components--the volume is at least that of a normal speaking voice and is uniquely identifiable as "arcane words". If a monster is casting a spell, I will say "The &lt;X&gt; begins casting a spell...."--that's your opportunity to counterspell. Monsters with counterspell will (in the main, with very few exceptions) counterspell the first N spells they can counterspell. I won't metagame the fact that you're telling me what spell you're casting.

=== Force Barriers ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;These are experimental and not often in use.&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Tiny Hut, Wall of Force,'' and ''Forcecage'' have additional language: "The barrier created by this spell is an object with (10+spell level) AC and a damage threshold of 5+(spell level/2), resistance to non-magical attacks, and immunity to fire, cold, poison, lightning, radiant, psychic, and necrotic damage. If the barrier takes damage in excess of its threshold, the caster must make a Constitution saving throw as if they had taken the damage while concentrating on the spell (even if it does not require concentration), except that the minimum DC increases by 2 for every time it is triggered for the duration of the spell. On a failure, the spell ends. Note: if the spell does not require concentration normally, this does ''not'' occupy your concentration, and does not benefit from things like War Caster (or other sources of advantage on Concentration saves). ''Disintegrate'' still automatically ends the spells as well.

Forcecage specifically: It loses the "immune to all damage" line. 

=== Polymorph (for campaigns starting on/after 7/31/2022) ===
Change "The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating)." to "the new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the '''level of the spell.'''"

== Races ==
See [[Player's Guide--Character Creation]] for available races.

Dragonborn can use their breath weapon as a bonus action (instead of an action). They also get darkvision (60 ft) and can choose between +2 DEX or +2 STR.

At your option, you can use the [[Player Option--Variant Races]] and [[Player Option--Regional Backgrounds]]. This is not required, but you can only use the Regional Backgrounds if you use the Variant Race that matches (for those with variant races).

== Inspiration ==
The party has a number of inspiration points equal to the number of players. These reset at the beginning of each session.

No player can use inspiration on themselves. Any ''other'' player may choose to use a point for someone else, allowing them to re-roll any d20-based check, attack, or saving throw. This can be done after the roll, and inherits any advantage/disadvantage from the first roll (ie if you had advantage before, roll again with advantage). You must use the second roll and no more than one inspiration can be used on any check.
== Variant Rules ==
* Encumbrance is used normally (NO variant encumbrance)
* Alignment is not in use.
* Combat Maneuvers (Climb onto a bigger creature, Disarm, Overrun, and Shove Aside) are in use.
* Feats and Multiclassing are available without restriction, subject to source restrictions.
* XP is off--see below for level advancement.
* Resting is normal (1 hr short rests/8 hr long rests), although certain occasions may call for modified rest schedules.
* Skills may be used with non-traditional abilities.
* Xanthar's downtime rules are in play. For crafting, see [[Items and Crafting]].

== Advancement ==
Instead of using XP (in any fashion), you will advance in levels in the following manner.

Each session where the table feels something meaningful happened, each player present will mark one tic under the XP portion of their sheet. When a character has accumulated a number of tics equal to their current level (or 4, whichever is smaller), they will advance in levels.

So, for example, if Bob is level 4, he needs to attend 4 meaningful sessions to reach level 5. A meaningful session may involve combat (or not), exploration, social interaction with other characters, etc.

      <text bytes="7061" sha1="jndsann54txnkyo7q85qq7ahsdvmztm" xml:space="preserve">Dwarves (cultural name: Tumnii) descend from the Lesser [[Titans]] who served Creation/Order, but whose runic nature was (partially) stolen during the [[Titan-Wyrm War|2nd Titan-Wyrm War]]...by their fellow Titans. Like the earth, they are solid and not easily moved; their tempers are volcanic when finally roused. 

== A Word About Clans ==
Tumnii use the word "ogav" (pl. "ogav", transliterated from [[runic script]]) for their super-family, sub-national organization; this is generally translated into Common as "clan" but is more literally "unit". An Ogav is ''roughly'' a group of tumnisi families who share governance and responsibility for a particular region (whether of tunnels or of surface lands). These families are ''usually'' related by blood and marriage, but such relationships are much less important than the bonds of Sanaa-ogavni (roughly "idea unity", often shortened to Sanoga). Sanaa-ogavni is the concept of being one in thought with another dwarf or group of dwarves. Across tumnisi cultures, this concept is usually one of the highest virtues. Clan splits are not uncommon nor are they particularly rancorous, usually, as lack of Sanoga means the clan would struggle to function. Lone dwarves, bereft of ogav, are considered outsiders and suspicious. The fact that other races (other than goblins) seem to lack the concept of sanoga as a driving force makes many dwarves suspicious of "tall folk".

Ogav tend to be led by a chief, usually called the Clan Chief, who is generally male. They handle the "hard" affairs of the clan. A woman (generally) serves as Chief Listener, handling the "soft affairs" of the clan and most importantly the Sanaa-ogavni. As a result, the Chief Listener tends to have the final say in important matters of clan business, although sanoga means that usually intra-clan disputes are small and mostly about process or means, not ends.

Inter-clan disputes are generally settled via council, although this differs strongly among inter-clan groups. Unlike sanoga which governs intra-clan relationships...there are no binding principles for inter-clan relationships except the general principles of truth and honor to which most clans at least pay lip service. There are no generally-accepted terms for inter-clan councils worldwide, although the Council of Exemplars in [[Fuar Uulan]] is an example of such councils.

== Physiology ==
Tumnii are overwhelmingly born as fraternal twins--one male and one female. Dwarves are considered adult at age 25 and generally live until they are about 120. Overall, they tend to be shorter than humans, standing between 4'0" and 5'2", but broader and more muscular. Generally, all adult dwarves have beards. Whether one or both sexes shave is a cultural matter. Of all the lineages of Quartus, there is the most in-group physiological difference between cultural groups of tumnii, as their physiology directly adapts to their circumstances at the clan-group level. 

== Noefran Dwarven Culture ==
Several main branches of dwarven culture exist, each with sub-divisions. Notable for the relative lack of sexual dimorphism relative to other dwarven groups. 

=== Council Dwarves ===
These are the clans that were once part of the [[Council Lands]] until its dissolution. Since then they've spread throughout the [[Successor States]] and into [[Shinevog]] and elsewhere. When most people of the [[Federated Nations]] think of dwarves, they're thinking of Council Dwarves. Two main sub-varieties: Surfacers and Deep-Mountain. Both groups have strongly-assigned gender roles, but neither gender is dominant. Male dwarves tend to deal with the "hard" things and women with the "soft" matters; men deal with crafting and mining while women farm or trade. Women are the judges and leaders. Ask a male dwarf to take charge and he'll almost always defer to his wife. Stubbornness is taught from a young age. Both varieties speak closely-related versions of [[Languages of Western Noefra|Bidni-kell]]. Virtually all Surfacer dwarves speak Common; many, but not all, Deep-Mountain dwarves do as well. In the most traditional, xenophobic clans, one or two low-status individuals are designated as "speakers with Outside" and learn Common.

==== Surfacer ====
Surfacer dwarves have ancestors that lived above ground and were craftsmen and traders. They tend to be taller than deep-mountain dwarves (averaging 4'8" with 5'0" not being too uncommon) but more wiry and slender than mountain dwarves. Sexual dimorphism (while muted compared to other races) is more pronounced in surfacer dwarves than in deep-mountain dwarves. This mainly shows up in facial features and body build. Height, weight, and strength are only minimally different. Female surfacer dwarves tend to have sharper features and straighter, longer hair than males. Both have elaborate beards.

Surfacer dwarves are less culturally conservative than deep-mountain dwarves, but still very conservative compared to other races (humans, especially). Surfacer dwarfs are not considered adult until they are married, with only a few (adventurers, basically) exceptions. Marriages are for life and divorce is strongly stigmatized. Remarriage happens after the death of a spouse, but is not very common. Widows and widowers gain the appellation "sigan," meaning "broken."

==== Deep-mountain ====
Deep-mountain dwarves are the arch-conservatives to the surfacer dwarves' moderation. Lack of ready access to rich foods and ample spaces have stunted the deep-mountain dwarves in height (averaging 4'4"); the constant workload in the mines and tunnels has increased their strength. There are very few external differences between deep-mountain dwarf sexes (unless you get them naked).

Except for adventurers, all deep-mountain dwarves that are found outside of their clans are married. The two act as a single unit. Marriages are monogamous and for life. Remarriage is extremely rare and strongly stigmatized. Adultery is social suicide (and often considered criminal). Widows and widowers tend to volunteer for the most hazardous duties and often become death-seekers (not suicidal per se, just unconcerned for their own lives). Children are raised by the clan as a whole.

Social stigmas are extremely powerful for deep-mountain dwarves. This leads to clan-level conformity. From the outside, it often appears as if a clan of mountain dwarves is a single organism that shares a mind (sanoga to the extreme). Disagreements (while they exist) are never shared outside the clan. The greatest taboo is to knowingly write falsehoods. This taboo is enforced by the death penalty.

==== Naming ====
Dwarven names (especially those from the Council Lands) are unisex and of the form &lt;Given&gt; &lt;Clan&gt;.

Example given names include:

Adilet, Aibek, Anara, Aybek, Bermet, Cholpon, Gulnara, Jyrgal, Ruslan, Sukhrab, Taalay, Zhyrgal.

Clan names include:

Chingis, Batbayar, Khulan, Gerel, Naranbaatar, Narangerel, Sarnai, Tsetseg

For clan structure in the Council Lands, see [[Dwarven Clans]].

To serve them in their tasks It created the Progenitor Races, numbering six. This is the story of those that trace their descent from the servants of Creation (AKA Order), the Titans.

Tasked with forming the physical bones of the world, the Titans were built in a variety of shapes and sizes. Most notable were the Great Titans. Humanoid figures supposedly standing 80-100 feet tall, made of metal and stone and clothed in glowing runic words, these majestic creatures shaped the world, creating valleys with their fists and scooping up mountains. Wielding the power of runic writing they warred for dominance with the Wyrm during the [[Ages of the World|First Age]] of the world after the [[Prehistory|Dawn War]]. But as all things must die, so did the Titans. When, in hubris, the [[Titan Conclave]] created the [[Orb of All Might]] to gain victory over their perpetual foes the [[Wyrm]], they empowered that fell device by draining the pussiance from their lesser kin. Those victims, reduced in size, stature, and might, became the ancestors of the modern-day [[dwarves]].

The [[Orb of All Might|Orb]] was then used to similarly diminish the Wyrm, creating modern-day [[Dragons|dragon-kind]]. The resulting backlash shattered both the Orb and the runic power used to create it. The remaining Titans fell as well, quickly losing the ability to manipulate their own size as well as outside matter. They are currently known as the [[Jazuu]] or goliaths; those who have survived ritual transformations with what remains of the runic power are known as giants.

      <text bytes="6436" sha1="kw6grjle1ct8qmnixu0zg2lmn4itdqj" xml:space="preserve">''Historian's note: This is a fragment of a text recovered from the ruins of the Library at Hawk's Peak. It appears to have been written as an introduction to the universe during the time of the Western Empire (about 700 B.C.). Its accuracy cannot be determined. The Congregation certainly won't confirm or deny any of this. Footnotes in the original text have been reproduced in square brackets. The footnote at the bottom has been added, as have section headings.''

[Author's note: The following is the best reconstruction that the priests of The Seeker in the Darkness have been able to create based on interviews with dragons, prophets, divine help, etc. Since the only one who witnessed most of these events is bound in the Abyss eternal, all the information herein should be considered second-hand at best.]

==== Creation ====
Before time began, the universe/planet/local area was void; all was part of the [[Dark Beyond]]. No laws governed the behavior of the unorganized matter and energy. The first being of which the stories tell is only known as The One, the Dreamer. This being, seeing the chaos, laid plans to establish order.
 
He first created the 8 + 1 [[Primordials]] to serve as his lieutenants. Beings of unimaginable power, they each held mastery over one domain. For ease of reference, they will be referred to by their domain titles. Whether they had names is unknown and probably unknowable. The domains of the Eight were:
* Fire (Energies)
* Earth (Solid matter)
* Air (Gasses)
* Water (Liquids)
* Light (Law, Progress)
* Darkness (Memory, Stability)
* Life (Organization, Creation)
* Death (Destruction, Decay)
The domain of the remaining Primordial is unknown. Some theorize that his was change or chaos[1], but this is strongly disputed. All real knowledge of this has been erased by powers far beyond man or god. The last Prince is only known as The Nameless.

===== The first races =====
The One gave each Primordial the power to organize out of the primal chaos a host of followers. None of these had the spark of intelligence. The elemental followers are commonly called elementals--the others include animals, plants, shadow creatures, etc. The Primordials of the elements were content with these raw beings.
 
To coordinate the work of these sub-sentient followers, the One created for Light and Dark a race of intelligent beings. The names of these beings follow:
* Light gained the service of the [[Lightborn]], from which sprang [[Angels]], [[Infernals]], and (later) elven-kind.
* Darkness chose [[Leviathan]], that distributed consciousness living in the light-less depths of the oceans and the depths of the Crystal Sphere, the living memory.

Life and Death were set as directors of the whole work. Each got a servant race, more willful and individual than those of Light and Dark:
* The [[Titans]] were bound to the service of Life. Wielding runes they built and shaped.
* The [[Wyrm]] were bound to the service of Death. Breaking down unneeded or failed creations, they were the judges of all things.
* The Nameless got a humanoid race known as the [[Proteans]]. Flexible and adaptable, they were the speakers of the language of creation and mediated between the Primordials.

This work took untold eons. The Primordials and their followers would move throughout reality, stabilizing the planes and shaping them into a world. It was not without conflict, but all progressed until the work was nearly done. At this point the planes were not separate--all matter and energy coexisted in one.

==== The Dawn War ====

Then there was War in Heaven--the Nameless rebelled against the One and against the other Primordials. Why? Some say that whispers from Beyond reality drove him mad--others say it was out of pride and a desire to rule it all himself. Yet others claim that he saw the world approaching stasis with no place for him or his followers. No one knows. Even the eldest beings, the ones that participated in this war, aren't talking. Asking that question is a good way to get struck by the wrath of whichever deity you're talking to [Author's note: approximately 300 scholars died before we learned to stop asking]. Many of the powerful beings (of all races) joined him in his rebellion.
 
The Dawn War (as it came to be known among scholars) almost destroyed everything. Primordial and Power fought against Primordial and Power. The fighting wasn't just against the Nameless and his forces--there was division among the forces protecting Creation. When all was nearly lost, The One put an end to it. Employing the most ancient Law, the Law of Sacrifice, he broke the planes. The Primordials each became a Plane and was given a purpose in ordering Creation.

* Life merged into the fabric of what we now call the Prime Material Plane, also known as the [[Mortal Plane]].
* Fire, Earth, Air, and Water became the Elemental planes which stabilize the Mortal Plane.
* Light gave herself to form the [[Astral]] Plane, home of the Great Mechanism and the gods.
* Darkness gave himself to form the [[Abyss]], a prison eternal for the Nameless and his legions (now called Demons regardless of their race).
* Death became the [[Shadows]], buffering the planes. The spirits of the dead pass into Shadow--only the strongest find a foothold in the [[Astral]]. The rest fade into the aetheric background.
* The One became the [[Great Mechanism]] which cycles soul-stuff ([[Anima|anima]]) between the planes and stabilizes reality.
* The Nameless was stripped of his Name and Domain and exiled to the [[Abyss]].
The intelligent followers of each Primordial were given a choice: stay in the Prime and be reduced to a fraction of their selves, becoming mortal; or migrate to the realms formed by the essence of their Primordial. The only ones not given the choice were the [[Proteans]]. They were reduced to near-animal levels and bound to the Mortal. 
 
The Dawn War thus ended. Reality was saved at extreme cost. 
 
Note on timelines: All of this happened in deep pre-history. The latest date for the Breaking that ended the Dawn War is approximately 25,000 years before the present day (ybp). Most scholars place it at 30k+ ybp.

[1] This is now confirmed (post Cataclysm) to be correct. During the [[Cataclysm War]], the Nameless was freed from his prison and then dispersed into the rest of the universe, granting all beings free will.

|}

== The Crystal Shell ==
The entire setting, including all the planes, is bounded by a crystal shell about twice the distance from the star (Eua) as Earth's orbit is from Sol. Whatever may exist outside is cut off by this shell. In the material plane it is an actual shell made out of some crystalline material that is tougher than anything found elsewhere. Despite its toughness, creatures (or the thoughts of such strange creatures) from the Dark Beyond slip through, with varied results on the material plane.

== The Material (or Mortal) Plane ==
=== The Central Beacon, Eua ===
The center of the material plane is Eua, the sun. Unlike Earth's star, Eua is not a ball of fusing hydrogen. It's a sphere of condensed , light-and-fire-aspected anima fed by the Great Mechanism in the Celestial City. As a result, solar prominences, sun-spots, and solar flares are omens of disorder in the realms celestial. In size and output it is very similar to Sol, however. 

=== Planets in the Material (or Mortal) Plane ===
There are 4 planets orbiting Eua in perfectly circular counter-clockwise (as seen from above) orbits. Closest in is [[Primus]], a world of elemental extremes. It is said that creatures from the elemental planes vacation there. Second and third are [[Secundus]] and [[Tertius]]--twin planets orbiting each other at such closeness as to share an atmosphere. The orbital radius of the double planet is twice that of Primus.

Fourth and last is [[Quartus]], orbiting four times as far from Eua as does Primus (1 AU). There once were three moons, but the least moon was pulled down by the first shamans to end the Age of Wizardry 10,000 years ago (roughly). The others settled closer into its place. The moons are [[Quella]], often called the Blood Moon for its red hue, with a period of 32 days, and [[Teki]], the Bone Moon with an 8 day period. Quella is much larger, so they appear approximately the same size (1/2 the angular size of Earth's Moon) in the sky.

Quartus is where the events of the setting take place (with rare exception). Inhabited by the spirits of natural things (including the fey) as well as mortals, it is a place of adventure.
[[ File:MaterialPlane_sm.png|thumb|200px|The Material Plane]]

=== The Plane of Shadow ===
Surrounding Quartus is the transitive, liminal plane of [[Shadow]]. The Shadow is the home of the dead--all but the strongest spirits (or those devoured by demons) awaken here and live out a shadow of their life on Quartus until they fade away or are consumed by the predators here. Access to any other plane from Quartus requires passage through Shadow. Although it is transitive, space and time here are malleable, shaped by the intents and wills of strong living beings.

== The Inner Planes ==
Main Article: [[Elemental plane]]

There are 12 transitive inner (elemental) planes (as far as anyone is concerned). These occupy fixed segments of the Crystal Shell, radiating outward from the center. As you progress inward toward Eua, the planes become more energetic and chaotic. At the outside where Quartus orbits the four primalities (Fire, Earth, Air, and Water) merge and mingle to form the 12 elemental planes. Since Quartus's rotational axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane (ie an orbital inclination of 0), seasons are caused by the varying influences of the elemental planes it passes through on its orbit.

The year starts with Quartus entering Clay from Mud; summer begins as Quartus transitions from Coal to Lava. Autumn begins as Lightning turns to Smoke; Winter as Cloud becomes Ice.

== The Abyss ==
The [[Abyss]] was designed as a prison for the [[Nameless]] and his core followers/victims (the [[Broken Concept]]s) at the end of the [[Dawn War]] between the Primal Potentialities. It also serves as containment for the [[Oblivion Gate]]. After the [[Cataclysm]], when the Nameless and the Potentialities were fully absorbed into the planar structure, the Abyss became inhabited by those beings whose desires, goals, and/or methods were abhorrent to the current order of things. Creatures who exist there subsist on the dregs of energy they gather from the Material Plane, often by consuming mortal souls. The [[Demon Princes]], rulers of individual demesnes they have carved out, hold the power here.

Physically the Abyss is a small (about 2 Earth-radii) spherical void that orbits Eua in the space between planes. It's orbit is not simple--it's shaped like a clover-leaf. Twice a year (at the equinoxes) it draws to its closest metaphysical distance to Quartus and demonic summoning is at its peak.

== The Astral Plane ==
The [[Astral]] Plane is the home of the Great Mechanism that regulates all the planes. It pumps [[Source of Magic|anima]] (the stuff of souls, created when living beings grow and develop) around to the various planes, allowing the inhabitants to survive and maintain the Dream. The center of this Mechanism is the Celestial City, home of the the Celestial Host of angels and the Core. Located at the center of the Dream, "above" (metaphysically) Eua, it pumps anima into that great furnace. The [[Heavenly Congregation]] (the gods) and the [[Diabolical Families]] (the devils) live and work in various realms located within the enormous expanse of the Astral Plane. They all are engaged in the oversight and maintenance of the Dream, subordinate to the Great Mechanism and the Four who guide it. Between these realms swim strange creatures--radiant dragons, astral sharks, fish-like creatures, etc.

== The Dark Beyond and the Stars ==
The [[Dark Beyond]] is the home of alien creatures, some are benign and some are hostile--all are powerful and terrifying. One particular faction are the [[Awakener]], formless beings of thought that hate all material existence and try to subvert it and destroy it. The angels do fierce battle against their minions as they leak through the Crystal Shell. There are other entities out there in the endless dark, but little is known about them.

The stars are beacons, set by the [[Angels|angelic legions]] against the inside of the Crystal Shell as guide-points in their never-ending war.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text bytes="16890" sha1="qzd5cgahywxtbbjvl2c2qieey8y8zv7" xml:space="preserve">The Shadows, also called The Grave’s Threshold or The Between, is a liminal space between the other planes of existence. It’s the lubricant in which the gears and pistons of the Great Mechanism do their eternal dance. It buffers one from another and prevents potentially catastrophic impingement.

While the name suggests twilight and darkness, a lack of color or life, that is not a true depiction. The Shadows are a projection of the other planes onto the [[Quick Planar Cosmology Guide|Mortal plane]] and vice versa. In the Shadows, all the creatures of reality mix and mingle as do their hopes and dreams.

== Matter and Spirit in Shadow ==
Unlike the [[Astral]] or [[Abyss]]al, where physical, condensed-[[anima]] bodies are difficult to maintain, physical existence in Shadow is normal. Unlike the Mortal or Elemental planes, where aethereal bodies of diffuse anima held together by will are difficult to maintain, aethereal bodies are functional in Shadow and can interact normally with physical bodies by accreting a layer of shadow anima as an interface.

Shadow anima is the basic material building blocks of the Shadows. It responds to the conscious (and unconscious!) desires and will of sentient beings and takes physical form, forming bodies, buildings, rivers, and everything else on the plane. Shadow anima is much more fragile than the more elementally-aspected anima native to the Mortal and Elemental planes—without constant attention from a Spark (a mind), it reverts back to formless amorphia.

Travelers from the Mortal or Elemental planes who visit in their true bodies find themselves changed by long exposure to shadow anima, especially if they consume food made of shadow-stuff. These changes manifest first as sensitivity to the searing light of the Mortal sun (which disperses shadow-stuff), but that fades quickly as you re-acclimate to the more “real” Mortal anima. Progressively longer exposure replaces part of the subject’s body and soul with shadow-anima. This grants new and strange powers, but leaves one very vulnerable and at risk of total dissolution on return to the Mortal plane. The [[Cysgoroesi]] (shadow elves) have developed a method of avoiding these problems, but they do not share it with outsiders.

== The Borderlands ==
The first part of Shadow experienced by travelers or departed spirits is the Borderlands. This is the “true” plane of Shadow. It extends throughout the Crystal Sphere and the knowledgeable can use it to transition easily between the planes. In the Borderlands, time does not move the same as it does in the other planes. In this silvery void, bereft of any physical object except the predators and prey that call this strange place home and the solitary [[Colorfields Fortress]] of the [[Cysgoroesi]], time and space flow in tides and currents. Get caught in the wrong one and you might come out thinking a few seconds had elapsed but finding yourself a decade later, in an entirely different part of the Dream. Or the reverse—you may spend a lifetime in the course of a few seconds and travel thousands of miles, only to find yourself where you began.

Physical egress from the Borderlands happens via color pools. These shimmering portals range in size from a few feet across to many dozen yards. While the color patterns tell experienced Shadow travelers what plane they exit to, the exit destination within that plane is uncertain. Color pools are transitory in nature—both the destination plane and the location within the Borderlands are subject to change. The only partial exception is the [[Color-fields]], a region where there are dozens of quasi-stable portals overlooked by the largest of the [[Cysgoroesi]] fortress monasteries.

Travel through the Borderlands happens by conscious thought—you do not walk, instead you will yourself into motion. Beware of distraction, because the entire space is sensitive to your thoughts and you might find yourself facing your most carefully-hidden fear, made flesh by your unconscious mind.

The Borderlands is inhabited mostly by the restless spirits of the dead as they quest for a stable place in one of the other layers of Shadow and by the predators that feed on them. Shadow-sharks prey on the spirits of fish (and on more human spirits), star-spinner spiders weave webs of shadow to trap the unwary, etc. The only permanent sapient inhabitants are the Cysgor, who staff the Colorfields Fortress and use the Borderlands as a means of travel between the planes.

== The Other Layers ==
Unlike the Borderlands, which extend throughout space, the other three “layers” of Shadow only exist in pockets surrounding the inhabited worlds as they are the effect of the collective unconscious of the inhabitants of the worlds themselves and are shaped by the beliefs, hopes, and fears of the populace. They are co-existent and more akin to states of being rather than physical places. Three layers surround Quartus—Mirrorhaven, the Dreamlands, and the Waste (although this is not a full layer in and of itself). The convention among the learned is to treat them as if they were stacked vertically, with Mirrorhaven on top, closest to the Astral plane in the common depiction and the Waste on bottom (nearest the Abyss). While this is false (as the layers are all jumbled up in reality), it provides a workable model of the inter-relationships with the other planes.

In many places around Quartus, the the Borderlands is very thin and most who step through the Shadow Veil (whether in dream or in the flesh) find themselves seamlessly in one of the layers. Which layer depends on both the location (some areas are more attuned to one layer) and on the person’s own heart. This is especially true of the dead, who are drawn through the Veil and usually find themselves in the layer that best fits how their hearts and souls were attuned. This is not heaven or hell, not reward or punishment. Merely the attraction of like with like. The layers are not good or evil, merely different reflections of the Mortal plane and mortal hearts onto the other planes.

Each of the layers has a landmark location, a hub, if you will. This center of the layer contains what government exists (although none of them are dominant across the layer) and is the epitome of the nature of the planar layer. Each layer also is home to one or more of the [[Cysgoroesi|Cysgor]] fortresses, some of which stand abandoned.

=== Mirrorhaven ===
The bright mirror of the Mortal, Mirrorhaven is influenced by and partakes in the flow of energy from the Astral plane. Its nature is of bright colors, constant movement, and frenetic interplay of light and color. It is home to the Summer Court of the Fey, the assembly of spirits attuned to the “positive” emotions such as love, joy, devotion, pleasure, and the like. Do not be fooled by the names, however. Also associated with this layer is mania and illusion; nothing here is as it seems. Delusion is rampant; everything wears multiple faces. Decadence and lavish excess hide a hollow, insatiable hunger that cannot be filled—the shadow-stuff of which this is made is not stable or real enough to satisfy. The inhabitants continually search for greater and greater sensation to fill this numbness. The majority of the populace is the spirits of those departed mortal souls that were attuned toward the Astral, either as a life of devotion to the Gods or for personal reasons. Here they live a distorted reflection of their lives until either they lose track of who they are and dissolve into shadow-stuff, until they are devoured by one of the denizens, or until they press through to the Astral plane itself and carve out a residence there through transcendence.

The hub of Mirrorhaven is [[Centrum]]. This city once was the capital of the Western Empire of Noefra until a tremendous magical explosion threw it into Shadow about 800 years ago. The inhabitants have become shadow-kin, beings made of shadow-stuff. All the decadence, excess, and mania of the layer are most concentrated here—the entire city is one continual, frantic, eternal festival. Souls drift in and are caught up in the celebration. The weak burn out quickly; the strong prey on the weak for survival.

=== The Dreamlands ===
''Main article: [[Dreamlands]]''

The Dreamlands are the “dark” counterpart to Mirrorhaven. Where Mirrorhaven is attuned to the Astral, the Dreamlands are attuned to the elemental and the primal. This is the home of many of the fey, but especially the Winter Court. If Mirrorhaven is manic, the Dreamlands is soporific. The daily routine, the static sameness, the wilderness. If Mirrorhaven is deceptive, the Dreamlands is forthright in its madness. Here, the risk is depression and apathy. After a while, nothing seems to matter and the soul drifts into sleep. The spirits that find themselves here are those that were attuned to the primal, to the kami or to the elemental planes. They drift into slumber and disintegrate, meld with the layer, or force through to the Elemental and form bodies there.

The hub here is the [[Dream Titan’s Throne]]. This enormous (and physically inconsistent) castle, seemingly made of wood, rock, and bone changes from day to day; its inhabitants (mostly the fey) migrate around from “room” to “room” lest they get swallowed up in the dream and never awaken.

=== The Waste ===
Unlike the other two layers which coexist naturally (locations in the Mortal plane mapping nicely to locations in both layers), the Waste is an aberration, a scar that cuts through Shadow. Wherever the Mortal plane was strongly touched by the [[Abyss]], there in Shadow a pocket of Waste forms that blurs the layers together. This is a foothold of demons, a passage into the Mortal plane. It grows and shrinks, struggling against the other layers which try to contain it. Largely barren, what little life exists here is twisted and altered by the pervasive abyssal influence. The souls that end up here are those who were tainted, whether of their own accord or by the actions of others, by the abyss. Most of them reject the abyss and struggle against it. Some are consumed by demons as fuel, others who succumb to the corruption become demons and turn on their fellows. Others burn themselves out fighting the demons and the corruption. A few escape to the other layers or planes. Very few exist for very long after death, however. Unlike the other layers, life here is hard enough and the plane itself lets them be. Thus, Wasters are among the most sane of the inhabitants of shadow, not prone to the self-delusion or mania of Mirrorhaven or the apathy and indolence of the Dreamlands. Devils are often found here in force, playing their cosmic role as the opponents of demonic forces. Former mortals and fiends mingle freely.

The hub here is the [[Demesnes of the Mad Queen]]. This fortress was once a Cysgor monastery before it was abandoned due to the corruption of the area around it. From here, the [[Blightguard]] conduct raids against the surrounding corruption. Despite the name, the people here are as sane as any. The leader changes regularly as souls burn out—the average Blightguard only lasts 1-2 years.

== The Departed and Afterlives ==
All that lived must die. This is a fundamental fact of the Mortal plane. Nothing, once mortal, can be eternal without cost. Loss, forgetting, oblivion are the inescapable fate of those that die and pass into Shadow. Thus, the soul lives out a span, and then "dies" again. This happens in many different ways, but the general term for this second death is dissipation or dissolution. But in what state are they before they dissipate?

The sparks of the dead carry with them the nimbus that once mediated with their physical bodies. Upon arrival in Shadow, this nimbus begins to accrete a body of shadow-stuff. For many, this is an unconscious process that results in a body that matches the soul's self-conception. A few retain enough presence of mind to influence the process. While this accretion process gives them a body with which they can manipulate shadow-stuff and interact physically with visitors and other residents of the plane, this body is both volatile and more limited than the physical body they once inhabited. Severe emotional disturbances, afflictions, or even sensory overstimulation such as sexual climax can disrupt the hold of the nimbus on the shadow body, resulting in leakage and partial dissipation. Predators (sapient or not) can draw off portions of one's "flesh" with a touch. Large influxes of energy (such as a mana geyser in Mirrorhaven) can blast it apart, even though they would only injure a physical body. They are more limited in that they do not have the same capabilities for growth or development, as well as for magical manipulation. Those who were skilled with mortal magic find themselves capable of manipulating shadow stuff as if it were magic, but their magic is only a limited mimicry of their former capabilities. A few individuals avert this and retain much of their power--these individuals often find themselves ascending to the other planes as a result.

=== Psychopomps ===

The spirits of the departed generally pass into the Borderlands within minutes after the death of the physical body. The original design was that guides called ''psychopomps'' would meet them in the Borderlands and guide them into a suitable location in one of the other two layers (the Waste not being a thing in that design). These psychopomps would be liminal beings, mortal but touched by Shadow and able to move freely between the realms to accomplish their duties. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way most of the psychopomps lost their way, and new ones were not trained to replace them. None really know why, although there are theories. Even the existence of these original psychopomps and their organization has been forgotten. Post 250 AC: The [[Catocracy]] (and cats generally) serve in this role under the [[Watcher]].

=== Divine Enclaves ===
Astral powers (along with certain among the more powerful fey and elemental lords) have gathered together and created enclaves, regions of relative safety for their followers. Their agents seek out the spirits of the faithful, identifiable by the symbols that unconsciously form in their shadow bodies, and lead them to the enclaves.

==== Enclaves of the Gods ====
The [[Congregation]] maintains several joint enclaves. As a note, there are many instances of these enclaves, all joined by pathways that allow nearly-instant travel. So the physical location of these Congregational enclaves is not well-determined, and enclaves exist near every significant population of mortals.

; Enclaves of the Four: These are primarily sponsored by the [[Seasonal Four]]. They are noted for their similarity to the Mortal Plane and their sheer ''normalcy''. They exist in both Mirrorhaven and the Dreamlands.
; Enclaves of Peace: Maintained by [[Peor-fala]] and [[Sakara]], these are found in the Dreamlands. Quiet and calm, these cater to those whose lives were chaos against their wills.
; Enclaves of Hammers and Books: Maintained by [[Lon-Ka]] and [[Yogg Maggus]], these are towers of learning for the wise, found mostly in Mirrorhaven.
; Enclaves of Justice and Order: Maintained by [[Roel Kor]], [[Ytra]], the [[Hollow King]], and [[Tor Elan]] dominantly. They exist on the fringes of the Waste and cater to those who wish to risk their (after)life in fighting fiends.  
; Enclaves of Bright Colors: Maintained by [[Kela Loran]], [[Aerielara]], and [[Pinwheel]], these carnivals, art schools, casinos, and other such dens of stimulation exist mainly in Mirrorhaven's hub.

A few of the gods (ie [[Selesurala]], [[Lae Loara]], and [[Korokonolkom]]) sponsor only small individual enclaves, mainly on the strength of particular clerics.

==== Enclaves of the Ascended ====

Unlike the Congregational enclaves, the Ascended don't have the reach to sponsor globally-connected enclaves. Instead, they form enclaves wherever large numbers of their followers reside, in whatever layers are present there. Two notable ones are that of [[Nocthis]] in Shadow-Byssia and the [[Queen Ascendant]] in the Shadow-[[Jungle of Fangs]]. Followers who die outside those regions are likely to not find their way to an enclave.

==== Fey Enclaves ====

These are better termed Fey Courts. Spirits of mortals who stumble into them are often welcomed, although their stay is not without peril. Fey power transforms the mostly-defenseless mortals, shaping their shadow-bodies into new forms. Animals are a frequent favorite--hounds, horses, hawks, and other beasts of hunt and chase are quite common. The Wild Hunt is one particular one, catching those who were guilty of violence and shaping them into prey, while their victims become their hunters.

      <text bytes="13375" sha1="qf0zug8uqumgfyklvuevf9foykhsduz" xml:space="preserve">At the end of the [[Ages of the World|First Age]], when [[Titans]] and [[Wyrm]] rose to domination, not all newly-mortal [[Lightborn]] resigned themselves to the yoke of bondage. Some fled through natural gaps in the veil surrounding the Mortal Plane and approached the Center of Worlds in the [[Astral]], begging for admission and refuge. The exact request and the response of the Great Mechanism and its guardians is unrecorded, but Cysgor lore contains the following fragment:
 
 &lt;nowiki&gt; And thus spake the Bright Ones
 To the assembled Septs:
 "All that Mortal lives must die
 And lie forgotten in Shadow.
 In our halls Death cannot walk
 Nor can memory fade."

 Responded the Septarchs proud--
 "Then betwixt and between we shall dwell--
 With Death we shall make a pact
 And in Shadow walk, remembering." &lt;/nowiki&gt;

However it happened, those early dissidents chose to create a home for themselves in the newly-forming [[Shadow]]s, where they have stayed for the ages since then. Despite their ancestral boast, they are still mortal. And many resent this fact. The fabled response of the Septarchs to the Bright Ones still rings true in the ears of the Cysgoroesi leadership. The two major strains throughout Cysgoroesi culture are gathering memory and cheating death. As a result, Cysgor culture has changed very little over the ages. In part because time runs oddly in Shadow; in other part because preservation and retention of what went before is the driving force behind their way of life.

== Personality and Appearance ==
Most cysgor are calm, orderly people, at least on the surface. Their lives are circumscribed by tradition dating back millennia and by their rank. To outsiders they appear mysterious and passive, almost apathetic. They show little facial expression and their body language is subdued. This detachment is a facade, a mask of iron self-control. The Shadows have emotional effects on those that dwell there for long, and few dwell in Shadow as long as the cysgor. Those who spend too much time in the [[Shadow|Beastlands]], with its soporific effect, often seek out strong emotions and new sensations to keep themselves awake. They become hedonists and often become manic when blood is shed and pain is felt. Those who dwell in [[Shadow|Mirrorhaven]], with its bright colors and constant stimulation, seek peaceful oblivion in dreams and drugs. Failing that, they require extreme forms of pleasures to become excited, and frequently fall into sadism or masochism. Those in the [[Shadow]] Border often are infected with wanderlust, never able to settle down in one place; those from the Wastes become paranoid and are quick to resort to violence.

Physically, the depiction of the cysgor largely matches that of the shadar-kai from other Dreams. Sallow, pale skin and dark hair and eyes. Slender, almost emaciated frames. Those in the creches look more normal, with a tendency toward paleness. Exposure to the Shadows leaves its mark on the bodies. Those who have joined retrieval teams usually shave their heads and are tattooed all over their bodies with silvery lines forming something akin to circuit traces. These glow when they use their powers, especially the shadow-related ones.

== Septs ==
The primary organization of the Cysgor people is by Sept. Each sept interprets the original charge to "make a pact with death and walk in shadow, remembering" differently. The septs cut across monasteries, acting like philosophical or fraternal organizations. Bonds between sept members are generally as strong as, or stronger than, bonds between members of the same monastery. The major septs are detailed below. Each sept has a formal name and an animal nickname--the nickname is the more common one and is the one that outsiders might know. 

'''Bran Vras''' (Magpies) believe that the best way to survive is to stockpile as many powerful items as possible. They do this both to gain power for their race (to counteract their lacking numbers) and to reduce the strength of the outsiders. They work closely with the Ravens to build and modify their golem guardians.

'''Myji''' (Ravens) believe that the best thing to stockpile is souls. Specifically, they harvest the souls of powerful individuals who are on the brink of death, much like the Earth legends of the Valkyrie. These souls are housed in soul-gems and given a choice to serve as the guiding intelligence of the shadesteel golems that act as the eternal guardians of the monasteries. Those that refuse are housed in the monasteries and interrogated for memories and information.

'''Derevel''' (Beavers) are the least conservative, least tradition-focused, and least Shadow-oriented Sept. They believe in building both structures and communities. Unlike the other septs, they rarely venture outside the monasteries, and most of them never reside in Shadow at all.

'''Oula''' (Owls) are the most conservative sept. They preserve the memory of the past and of events. This is done by sending observers out in teams. They watch on the fringes of major events, memorizing the events. They interview the participants, using mind-magic to wipe their memory of the interview and of the observer's presence. These memories are then recorded back in the monasteries.

'''Orsa''' (Bears) are the protectors of the people. They pledge themselves to defend the monasteries and creches from all who would threaten the people, and take a very wide scope for things that would threaten. They often roam about, killing those that discover the secrets of the Cysgor or become too comfortable in Shadow. They are by far the most militant sept. Fortunately for everyone else, they're also the fewest in number.

== Fortress Monasteries and Creches ==
Birth and growth within the Shadows is not easy, nor safe. As a result, the Cysgor have claimed isolated pockets of the Mortal plane as creches, hidden cities where children are born and raised. In the beginning, the only inhabitants of the creches were the very young, the caretakers, and the mothers giving birth. The rest dwelled in Shadow in the monasteries. Over time, situation has shifted so that the bulk of the population lives in these creches and only the elite classes take up residence in Shadow. As a rule, these creches are placed in areas that are either difficult or impossible to access from the outside; the only access in or out is via Shadow portal. Only one creche remains active; two have been abandoned as the population declined.

[[Creche Deskinj]], the only active creche, is located on a small island between Noefra and Oelfra, about 800 miles from the Devil's Coast region. This island houses about 6,000 cysgor souls, more than half of the total population. About 2,000 are youth under the age of adulthood, the rest are farmers, craftsmen, and caretakers. This has always been the breadbasket of the cysgor people. A plurality of the people here are of Sept Deverel. The island itself is ringed with rocks and has no safe ports, making approach by sea very hazardous. Almost all travel is by portal through Shadow.

[[Creche Skeud]], the more recently-abandoned of the other two creches, was abandoned at the [[Cataclysm]] due to near-by volcanic activity. Located high in the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] in north-central [[Noefra]], it is still protected by golems and other static defenses. Before its abandonment, it was a progressive center belonging primarily to Septs Myji and Bran Vras. Here they performed research. In 211 AC, the [[Wild Cards]] discovered that the threat that caused the abandonment of the creche was a lie, at the behest of a demonic infiltrator. The rulers of the creche turned to experiments to create "perfect" bodies for the souls in the soul gems (and eternal life for themselves). Defeated and unmasked by the Wild Cards, the demon fled and was destroyed. Most of the liberated population of Shadesteel guardians and the cloned cysgor experimental subjects fled along with the Wild Cards to [[Zhapai Karmap]].

In 250 AC, [[Enigma]] visited it again and found that most of the city had been destroyed at the orders of [[Abbot Kaga]] (orders borne of paranoia and fear). The abbot had been killed by [[Scythe]] [[Ios al'Tor]] on 3 Spring Dawning 250 AC, and the abbot's failsafe had activated, reducing the remaining shadesteel guardians to prisoners in their own bodies which attacked any intruder. Researcher [[Teneg]] had been trapped in her own "thought network," a private mental world made from artificial near-souls. [[Enigma]] liberated her and she gave her remaining sanity to disable the failsafe, freeing the souls of the remaining shadesteel.     

[[Creche Moger]], the first creche, was abandoned at Moon's Fall at the end of the 2nd age. Its ruins, still mostly intact, lie high in the mountains that ward the northern edge of the [[Great Rift]] from the [[Primal Sea]]. Once home to Septs Oula and Orsa, it was the archive of the Cysgor. Expeditions have recovered some of the material stored there, but much still remains.

In the Shadows are the Fortress Monasteries, inhabited by the elite of the Cysgor people. One major one stands in each layer of shadow, as described below, and several minor monasteries guard the approaches. There used to be many more, but the Cysgor are in decline and have been for centuries. The others stand abandoned by the living; only the shadesteel guardians, spirits of the dead, and traps linger behind to protect the secrets. Many of the Fallen have tried to plunder them, but doing so is very risky.

The known monasteries are as follows. Each is marked active or abandoned as well as by the layer of Shadow on which it stands. Each active major monastery houses about 850 people, while the minor ones house about 100 each. 

=== Active major monasteries ===

Fortress Brightpool stands in the Shadow Border, overlooking a natural collection of planar portals between realms. Brightpool is the stronghold of Sept Oula, although many members of other septs live there or are based there. It is the most active, with agents coming and going frequently. It does not have any satellite monasteries.

Fortress Deadlands is on a great hill overlooking one of the worst parts of the Waste. Home to the leadership of Sept Orsa, it has a healthy presence of Septs Deverel and Myji--one to maintain the constructs who do most of the fighting, the other to scavenge souls from the eternal battlefields down below. It used to have satellite monasteries; all but one have been overrun by the Waste and are now home to demon-twisted forces.

Fortress Myfryr is buried under a lake in Mirrorhaven on the outskirts of the City. It has the most mixed population from all the septs, but Myji is the strongest. It maintains three satellite monasteries, placed to watch over the areas of Mirrorhaven claimed by the Congregation for their faithful followers after death. They often try to poach stronger souls.

Fortress Cysga is located near the Titan's Throne in the Beastlands and maintains two satellite monasteries. The quietest of the monasteries, this is the home of Sept Bran Vras as well as their core vaults and research center. It maintains 2 satellite monasteries for specialized research purposes, including the golem development center they share with Sept Myji.

=== Abandoned monasteries ===

Six major monasteries have been abandoned, along with many smaller satellite monasteries. Several have been lost to the Waste; the others were tightly tied to the lost creches and the survivors no longer hold the keys for access.

The first abandoned monastery was [[Lyo Duo]], assaulted by demons during the [[War of Blood]]. It stands in the Waste at the spot that corresponds to [[Mt. Fearg]]. In the Mortal plane, this is the site of the original fortress/capital of the Bloodtide, the [[Red Fang]]'s mortal army during the [[War of Blood]]. Its fall directly lead to the Breaking of the [[Pact with Death]] that allowed the cysgor to flourish in shadow, as well as to the creation of the first shadesteel guardians. It might be said that this was the turning point that has led directly to the diminishment and slow march to extinction of the cysgor.

== Monastery Organization ==

Monasteries are led by an Abbot chosen from the sigiled population. The Abbot is not usually the head of the dominant sept, although they are usually a member of that sept. The Abbot oversees the work of the monastery and must authorize any outside visitors or unusual excursions. Each monastery has a different tradition for choosing their Abbot.

Working under the Abbot are the Priors and sub-priors, who direct specific aspects of the life and work. For example, most monasteries have a Prior over maintenance as well as one responsible for food production. Other Priors handle the other functional business, whether research, field work, or defensive operations. Satellite monasteries are led by priors or sub-priors and house their respective teams.

Teams of cysgor, each led by a hierophant, are the active working groups. They may have between 8 and 12 cysgor each, and a Prior may manage 10 to 12 teams. Rarely, cysgor may act in groups of as small as two or three. Oula, for example, tend to work in groups of three, each recording the same information as a redundancy check.

      <text bytes="6660" sha1="tneavovs9w3rbeu4o5v96lqugbrlqoi" xml:space="preserve">The Astral Plane is huge, covering the entire volume enclosed by the Crystal Shell. The vast majority of this space is unformed, occupied by clouds of diffuse anima and various astral denizens such as radiant dragons and void sharks (as well as their prey, radiant sheep among them). Running throughout are the tubes and pipes of the Great Mechanism, distributing anima to all parts of the Dream.

Within this immense volume of space lie 5 domains--ordered zones inhabited by astral creatures. The Celestial City is centered around Eua; the other four are shaped like sections of a spherical shell with radius equal to that of Quartus's orbit, although together they do not add up to a whole sphere. Scattered through the internal volume are demi-planes, islands of stability in the churning Astral Sea.

[[File:astral_plane_top.png|thumb|200px|Astral Plane, top view. Not to scale. Not shown: Central vortex.]]
[[File:astral_plane_side.png|thumb|200px|Astral Plane, side view. Not to scale.]]

== The Celestial City ==
Main Article: [[Celestial City]]

Located at the center of the Astral Plane, contiguous with Eua (the sun) and the source of it's radiance, the [[Celestial City]] is the home base of the 1st Host and the center point of the Great Mechanism. It is composed of four separate zones, each with a separate purpose. These four zones are connected by portal networks, although most of the denizens here can fly under their own power.

=== The World Core ===
The Celestial City is at the center of the Dream. As such space is oddly distorted, especially near the World Core. Up and down are strange--no matter your orientation around the parts of the Core, the rest of the city is always above you. The whole city is sheathed in about a mile (from the closest obstruction) of breathable, flyable air (really anima that behaves like air). Once you leave that bubble gravity no longer applies. Within that bubble, things are drawn to the plane of the World Core. If you were to fall, you'd yo-yo back and forth, eventually (slowly) coming to a rest on the level of the Core.

[[File:World-Core-small.png|thumb|200px|The World Core]]

About two miles across and one mile wide, the World Core is the heart of the Great Mechanism. Made out of a material that appears to be brass, but is much more resistant to attack, it controls the power that keeps the entire Dream functioning. Two vortexes of anima spiral into the central segment--one from above and one from below. These vortexes glow with a steady light and provide the lighting for the entire Celestial City. Each of the circular structures is actually spherical--like beads strung onto a circular wire. The outer layer of each sphere is uneven--some are filigree, others are covered in gears that occasionally spin and move. The beads are hollow--the laborers that maintain the World Core work and live in them. The rings are gigantic conduits 64 feet in diameter; through them pulse terawatts of power. The entire core revolves slowly around the axis of the vortexes, exactly matching the rotation of Eua itself, revolving once every month.

The central pod is different from the rest--the outer surface is made of overlapping disks set edgewise into the surface of a smaller sphere. Those disks spiral upward and downward--at the very top and bottom are obelisk-like pylons that catch the anima from the vortexes and channel it into the core. Scholars believe that at the center of that pod is the Heart itself with the Divine Four fused into it. Only the Congregation has access, and then only on command.

=== The Machinarium ===
The closest area of the City to the World Core, the [[Machinarium]] holds the forges, production facilities, and workshops of the 4th legion of the 1st Host. A spherical volume covered in buildings and chasms, it is home to the millions of devils belonging to the Territory of Thoraz as well. From here, portals link to the Host's outposts throughout the Dream and to the Elemental Planes of Fire and Earth for each of the planets. It is said that the entire area is one gigantic machine--it is certain that it rearranges itself from time to time.

=== The Laboratorium ===
Home to the research facilities and testing grounds for the 3rd legion of the 1st host, the [[Laboratorium]] lies on an oblong disk positioned on a level with the Machinarium but directly on opposite sides of the Core. Very few beings willingly go here--even fewer return. 

=== The [[Field of Ardor]] ===
This is the furthest area of the City from the Core--it is also the largest. A disk 64 miles wide with a hole in it for the central vortex, it is the only part of the city not entirely covered in buildings. The Field houses the Well of Souls (the place of rebirth for the angelic Hosts) as well as the headquarters for the 1st Legion of the 1st Host and the 4th legion of the 4th Host. Newly-reborn angels are trained here and the senior angels have their estates here as well.

== [[Mara]]--Home of Desiring ==
A mix of country and city, this domain is covered in greenery and lush vegetation. The second-smallest, it has an area of about 500,000 times that of Quartus. It contains the homes of [[Sakara]], [[Peor-fala]], [[Aerielara]], and [[Kela Loran]]. The devil Territory here is that of [[Mara-deva]].

== Ghenna--Home of Striving ==
Main Article: [[Ghenna]]

A harsh land with mighty beasts, [[Ghenna]] is dominated by the [[Grand Arena]] where heroes, devils, and elemental beings fight for glory. Second in size, it is about 100 million times the surface area of Quartus. It is home to [[Tor-Elan]], [[Roel Kor]], [[Melara]], and the [[Hollow King]]. Here is found the Territory of [[Chou]].

== Aaru--Home of Knowing ==
This small domain is covered in workshops, libraries, and laboratories. Smallest of the domains, it occupies an area of only 20,000 times that of Quartus. It is the home of [[Yogg Maggus]], [[Loran Hae]], [[Lon-Ka]], and [[Ytra]]. It is the Territory of [[Leiutis]].

== [[Naga Padoha]]--Home of Living and Dying ==
This vast wilderness of strange plants and animals is the home to [[Pinwheel]], [[Korokonolkom]], [[Selesurala]], and [[Lae-loara]]. Gigantic seas churning with predators and prey dot the landscape, each many thousands of times the whole surface of Quartus. Where do the Sparks come from for these creatures? No mortal knows; if the Congregation knows, none will tell. The largest of the domains, Naga Padoha is nearly 250 million times the surface area of Quartus. It is also the home to most of the Ascended Heroes and also to the strange beasts that prowl the astral plane. It is the Territory of [[Ka-Kola]].

      <text bytes="4295" sha1="gubym65zrqr0mts1xkrekrkidwipnbq" xml:space="preserve">Established in the [[Federated Nations]] in 238 AC, the Crystal Spire Protocols (CSP) are an international agreement regarding the growing concern about [[Registered Companies]] and private adventuring groups. With the pull-back of the [[Adventurer’s Guild]] from the front lines of the adventuring trade, private groups had exploded and were acting as quasi-military armed groups. This included holding villages hostage for ransom or extorting tribute.

As a reaction, the CSP was negotiated by Guildmaster [[Catalysts|Vassarian]] and the leaders of all the [[Federated Nations]]. So far, enforcement has been thorough. There are complaints about the Enforcers being too heavy-handed, however.

=== Article 1: Ranking and Registration ===
A [[Adventuring_Ranks|rank]]ing system for adventurers is hereby established. All adventurers qualified for B rank or above must be registered with the [[Adventurer’s Guild]] and must belong to a [[Registered Companies|Registered Company]]. Local Company representative must be kept aware of movements and assignments; Guild must be notified if they leave their assigned area.

==== Addendum (God-End Conference, 1 Spring Dawning 251 AC) ====
The required registration of Article 1 is partially rescinded. Now adventurers of B-rank quality are allowed to freelance. [[Registered Companies]] are asked to monitor their actions where possible and "politically sensitive" operations must be vouched for by a local authority (either of a Company or of a signing government).

=== Article 2: Controls on magic use ===
Magic of 3rd circle or higher is forbidden against other FNC members except by members of the military acting under orders during a declared war. Magic of 5th circle or higher is only allowed under FNC supervision; use in warfare against FNC members prohibited. Use against enemy creatures permitted with restrictions.

Domination magic forbidden, use of charm effects against civilians without consent is criminalized. Creation, summoning, or maintenance of undead or demonic entities is punishable by death without trial.

=== Article 3: Controls on magic items ===
"Common" items may be owned by anyone. These are not controlled. Ownership of "uncommon" or above items must be registered with the Guild and is restricted to active members of [[Registered Companies]] in good standing. Legendary-quality items require special authorization. Certain national treasures are grandfathered in; these are controlled by the national leadership of the respective countries.

===== Addendum (God-End Conference, 1 Spring Dawning 251 AC) =====
As with Article 1, the restrictions here are loosened. Only items with properties deemed "mass-casualty-capable" or otherwise of significant historical or political significance are controlled and registered.

=== Article 4: Penalties and protocols for punishing rogue adventurers ===
RCs have an affirmative duty to cooperate with AG enforcers in hunting down adventurers who violate the CSP (honored in the breech, mostly). Banditry, raiding, blackmail, and extortion are criminal acts. Violations of CSP provisions are policed by the Enforcers, who are B &amp; A rank adventurers hired by the AG and given powerful items.

      <text bytes="11018" sha1="tw43ewlpx82iec0ymdmgtveh9a84cek" xml:space="preserve">== Adventurer's Guild History ==
=== Early Years (200-205 AC) ===
The Adventurer's Guild started as an adjunct branch of the [[Council Lands]] military under the command of the [[Fist of the Sun]] and his acolytes. Adventurers were mostly condemned prisoners who were given a chance to "expiate" their crimes in the service of the people. This was a chance only given to those who were not considered threats or had been unjustly condemned. Teams of prisoners were assigned to work in an outlying area, completing tasks set by the locals. These were uniformly the tasks so risky that no free man would do them willingly. The life expectancy of adventuring teams was, as a consequence, very short. Most completed two or three missions before being permanently crippled or killed.  A small percentage prospered, gaining strength as their souls absorbed the anima released by their fallen foes and their new experiences. Other nations had similar organizations, but generally smaller and less formally organized (and less compulsory).

=== Going International (205-227 AC) ===
One particular team, later known as the [[Catalysts]], did more than just prosper. They participated in the discovery and opening of the [[Towers of Sun, Earth, Moon, and Stars]] to research teams, earning their freedom. They then went on to found the [[Federated Nations]] and have become a major political force. Their strong displeasure at being wrongly convicted and enslaved led to a sea-change in the Adventurer's Guild. In 205 AC, the first year of the Federated Nations, control of the Adventurer's Guild (and all remaining adventurer teams from all nations) was transferred to the new Federated Nations establishment, under the control of the neutral Windwalker Collective. The hobgoblins took to the role of trainers and judges with gusto, and the Adventurer's Academy was created. All existing teams were called in for evaluation and training (and given the opportunity to quit if they so desired). Other experienced folks (mostly of military background, although some arcanists and priests joined) were given an orientation course and sent out quickly (as a stop-gap measure). At the same time, construction of the Adventurer's Academy continued apace. In 210 AC, the first set of sanctioned adventurers who were recruited, sorted, and trained from the ground up graduated from the [[Adventurer's Academy]] at [[Fort Hope]] and set out to explore and protect.

As tensions grew and nation started to grumble against other nations, the Guild played a major role in keeping the Federated Nations together. They stood between the [[Night's Faithful]] and the [[Wyrmhold]] army in the [[Caldera Conflict]] of 220 AC, played major roles in resettling the refugees from the [[Tlalocana]]n expansion, and opened up new continents through the [[Portal Network]], among other feats. But the task of keeping the peace left them with fewer and fewer opportunities to adventure in support of the common folk. This led to the rise of [[Registered Companies]] of mercenary adventurers.

The attempted coup by the remaining [[Guildmasters]] in the [[Council Lands]] (now called the Republic of Federated Free Peoples) was the tipping point. As a result of their scattered manpower, the Guild was unable to intervene until [[Marcia (Dragon)| Marceline]] the ruling Dragon had been critically injured protecting the [[Immortal Bard]] from assassins. As a consequence, the situation spiraled downward into civil war, leading to the breakup of the [[Council Lands]] in 230 with the [[Treaty of Rauviz]].

=== Crystal Spire Protocols (238 AC) === 

After the breakup of the Council, the Adventurer's Guild focused more and more on policing private adventuring companies. As the bad acts grew, the nations eventually gathered together at the [[Crystal Spire]] in the new [[Crisial Kingdom]] to sign a pact to manage these adventurers. The resulting [[Crystal Spire Protocols]] gave the Guild enforcement privileges over the other [[Registered Companies]] as well as a monopoly on high-level magic and magical items.

Currently, the AG is an elite force of high-rank adventurers dedicated to policing other adventurers. They only accept the best and most loyal, and wield tremendous power. As a result, the popular opinion of them is mixed. Some thank them for controlling adventurers; others claim that they've become secret rulers and just as bad as the bandits they ostensibly suppress.

== The Four-fold Mandate ==
The Adventurer's Guild has been given four commands that form the mandate of the organization. They are

; Unify : Encourage the people of various nations to work together to prevent conflict. This is accomplished by sending mixed-background teams out wherever they're needed, without regard to background or upbringing.
; Protect and Serve : Adventurers are to defend the people of the Federated Nations against all threats, especially those that are not suitable for military resolution. They are not to be the masters, but the servants. They take requests from common and noble alike. Unlike the Old Guild, they are not required to stay in one location--they should go wherever they're needed and generally stay in the thick of the action.
; Explore : An adventuring team should make it a priority to seek out new things, to rediscover locations and knowledge lost in the Cataclysm, and to bring it back to benefit the people of the Federated Nations. If the adventurers get rich in the process, well, that's only natural and right.
;Train : Guided by the example of the [[Catalysts]], there are certain people who can gain power at a much faster rate (and to higher levels) than the common folk. The Guild is mandated to seek these people out, recruit them, and find out which ones can be trusted with this power. This mandate is not spoken of commonly--it's phrased as helping people gain power. In reality, the Guild is tasked with judging those who have the potential for great power and marking those it considers unfit for such power for elimination or for further observation.
 
== Rights of Adventurers ==
Sanctioned adventurers (those with membership in the Guild) are granted a range of legal rights by international treaty.

;Independent social standing : Adventurers exist outside the social standing structure of whatever nation they're in. This makes them immune to (for example) forced labor and weapons laws. This does not give them the right to command others or rights of justice--those must go through the local authorities. Even ba who become adventurers are considered of muen rank in the Stone Throne.
;Legal immunity (limited): Adventurers have limited immunity to local laws. When in direct furtherance of a legal mission they commit acts that would normally be crimes, they have the right to be judged by the Guild if arrested by local authorities. If the Guild determines that their actions were excessive or not in furtherance of a legal mission, the adventurer is expelled and subject to full legal penalties. In practice, this right serves to prevent the legal authorities from arresting the adventuring teams on pretexts. Adventuring teams that find themselves having to commit theft or murder better have very good justifications (discovering that the target was worshiping the Outcast, for example).
;Free travel : A sanctioned adventuring team can enter any city or town in the Federated Nations.
;Weapon/Spell Freedom : Unlike common folk, adventuring teams can cast spells for any legal purpose without requiring a license. They can carry weapons and wear armor in restricted zones--the only exception is in the direct presence of an upper-rank national leader.
;Possession of Artifacts : Normally, magical artifacts discovered in ancient ruins are considered state property and are illegal for most "normal" people to own. Adventurers can own and use such artifacts in the furtherance of their duties.

=== Other Benefits ===
The Guild maintains an agreement with a wide variety of merchants, vendors, and amenity providers. Merchants agree to sell adventuring supplies (including weapons, armor, and other gear) to sanctioned adventurers for a fixed price. In return, the Guild offers compensation if that fixed price happens to be below the market price. Selected merchants (one in each larger village or town, usually) are chosen as Guild merchants--these will buy non-magical relics (art objects, gems, etc) from adventurers for a fixed price based on a published list; in return the Guild guarantees a ready supply of coin and a minimum profit margin when the agent sells the purchased item to buyers.

The Guild also provides sanctioned adventurers with tokens that entitle them to a room at certain inns. While these are not always the best inns, it provides them a place to stay and to store their stuff between missions. Mechanically, this entitles sanctioned adventurers to a Modest lifestyle without cost, as long as they're actively adventuring.

== Guild Organization ==
The central Adventurer's Guild has four branches that provide support for the Mandate. The specialties of each branch are apparent from the names.

=== Training Branch ===
The Training branch is primarily located in and around the Adventurer's Academy at [[Fort Hope]]. Most of the labor is provided by hobgoblins and goblins from the Windwalker tribe (which has devoted itself to running the Federated Nations). Specialist trainers from all lands participate.

=== Information Branch ===
Spending their time looking for new adventurer prospects as well as areas of concern (to reassign adventuring teams), the Information branch pulls from all races and nations. They especially recruit inn and tavern keepers to serve as informants and information sources.

=== Logistics Branch ===
After the Catalysts exposed the Dark Lady's machinations in the Commerce Guild in the Council Lands, a large chunk of the master merchants and craftsmen associated with that guild joined the fledgling Adventurers Guild. They deal with merchants to supply adventuring teams, buying the items that are sold back to those merchants and finding collectors for them (and for the information brought back). They also support the Training branch by creating and maintaining their equipment. Logistics branch operations form a major independent source of funding for the Guild. 

== Guild Funding ==
Most of the funding for Guild operations comes from the constituent governments of the Federated Nations. Another source of funding is a surcharge placed on quest rewards. This is transparent to the adventuring teams, but quest givers tend to play about 10% (although this varies) of the value of the reward offered to the Guild for their services. The third portion comes from sales of items recovered by guild teams and other investments made by the Logistics branch. A growing portion comes from transit fees through the [[Portal Network]] that the Guild maintains and controls.

      <text bytes="13757" sha1="dcrdsjk340c30gz7g5v4p89olg3gerb" xml:space="preserve">''Hello everybody! It's your favorite dwarven head in a jar, [[Nikola Chapek]], back with another edition of "Answers to questions you've never asked!" In today's episode, we'll be taking a look at the portal network that connects the Federated Nations.''

Most of you arrived at this Academy by way of a magical portal. You can't have missed it--it was a giant circle of black metal and stone that created a field of swirling colors into which you walked. Portal exits are scattered throughout the land This is the secret sauce, the source of the Adventurer's Guild's wealth and power. It also can be the weakness of the Federated Nations. Unless you're on Guild business, access to these portals is restricted and costs huge amounts.

So how do they work? Who built them? Is it true that if two people enter at the same time they may end up getting...mixed together?

== History ==
The common (among scholars, anyway) belief about the portals is that they were built by the ancient [[aelvar]] at the height of their empire during the [[Ages of the World|Second Age]], about 6000 years ago. This doesn't seem to match the facts, though. As I explain below, the portals operate by manipulating the shadow border and artificially generating color pools, a feat not possible by wizardry as we know it. The style of construction also doesn't match what little remains of that empire (being all dark metal and stone rather than the shiny crystal and bright colors of aelvar manufacture), nor are the symbols used found among the gwerin alphabet.

So it's not aelvar construction. Then who created the portals? I believe the [[Cysgoroesi]] did. Yes, that's right. The shadow elves, the Dark Watchers. The same ones who never get involved. We know that they're masters of Shadow, after all. Having spent 200 years with nothing better to do than to review the library, I found references to Shadesteel (a material used by the Cysgoroesi to build constructs, with very similar properties to gate portals), to similar arcane signatures when Cysgor were seen transiting between planes, and at last, a fragment of an account supposedly dating back to the Second Age. It told of a bargain between "aelves of Light and aelves of shadow," in which the one gained "footholds in every place and plane" and the other gained "a claim on the souls of heroes past and future."

This raises a concern about the security of the portal network. I'll discuss that much more in detail below, in the Security section of this article. 

== Operating Principles and Limitations ==
The portal network operates by artificially generating color pools targeted to specific beacons. Based on "Through Swirling Shadows: a memoir of a plane-hopping wizard" by Architecturas in the late Third Age, the portal locations are discernible as beacons in the [[Shadows|Shadow Border]]. He claims to have seen pairs of color pools , spaced mere yards apart, spin up, figures transit between them, and then vanish. Since space and time are distorted in Shadow and color pools allow access between specific locations on the various planes, this makes sense.

How do they do this? Not with any mortal wizardry. The anima signature of portal transit is completely unlike that of "normal" teleportation or planar travel spells. Not only that, it is tremendously more efficient than standard methods. A powerful wizard might be able to teleport a small party once or twice a day, at the cost of a long ritual or a risky spell. Even the most efficient (''teleport circle'') only stays open for a few moments. The portals function repeatedly, with very little draw on the ambient anima and can stay open for up to 38 minutes (longer if an outside source of energy is available). What's more, the activation of the portals can be accomplished by any living being capable of pressing the appropriate runes.

The portal network requires certain key elements to function: A destination code, a portal entrance, a calibrated Dimensional Hopping Director (DHD), and a keystone crystal. Destination codes are 7 symbols, each one of which is found on the portal entrance. Order is critical and no symbol can be repeated within the same gate destination code. These codes also serve as valid teleport circle destinations--in effect the portals form permanent teleport circle locations as a side-effect of their duties as shadow beacons. A traveler enters the destination code for the portal he wishes to visit into the DHD. This device takes the form of a short cylindrical pillar with an angled top surface. Carved into the top surface in concentric rings are the same gate symbols as appear on the gate itself. In the center is a faceted red crystal the size of a fist. When a being touches a symbol, it starts to glow and stays glowing until all 7 are input and the central crystal is pressed. If a valid gate code was input, the connection is made and the portal forms. 

Each portal entrance is approximately 22 feet in diameter. When activated, a pulse of silvery energy forms (like the splash formed by a rock in a pond) on the active side, reaching out five or ten feet. The destination is not visible through the portal--instead a shimmering curtain of silvery energy covers the portal. Stepping through that portal lands you at your destination. Any harmful momentum you were carrying is stripped--projectiles launched across the curtain fall harmlessly on the other side. While this transit seems instantaneous, really the traveler is stepping between color pools and being projected through the Shadow Border for a few yards. This seems to happen with the traveler in a state of stasis--travelers do not remember this part. The gates will stay open for 38 minutes at most, and automatically disengage if no matter passes through them successfully within 30 seconds of activation, or if more than 1 minute goes by without matter transmission after the first transit. They can also be disabled by pressing the central crystal while active.

The keystone crystal is the heart of the whole process. It is the part that creates the beacon, communicates with other gates, draws in anima and shapes the color pools in Shadow, maintains the security of the gate tunnel, and prevents accidents in and around the gate. It incorporates a slew of safety features. For example, attempting to establish a connection with a gate that is already open will fail and the gate will chime three times. All attempts to damage a gate with a functioning keystone crystal have failed. Not even a battalion of powerful wizards blasting it with all the spells at their disposal (including pulling meteors down on it) have even left a mark on the surface. Trust me. We tried that. Without the crystal in place, the gates are just as vulnerable as any other construction of similar materials. It's as if the gate exists in a state between worlds, partially in the Mortal plane and partially in Shadow. In addition, travelers or objects moving at dangerous speeds are slowed down to safe ones when they reach the gate opening, preventing harmful collisions or injury while in transit. Gates without crystals can be moved normally, although they're very heavy and bulky. Gates with installed crystals cannot be moved, even if a giant hits it with a club. If a gate is moved more than a mile or so, the DHD attached will need re-calibration, a process of ritual that requires a few days from a team of mage technicians. Crystals can be transplanted between DHDs without incident--the gate code is fixed by the gate itself, not the crystal.

Because the crystals create beacons, anyone with proper knowledge and access to a gate can "ping" any other beacon and determine its operating status. This does not tell the user the gate code for the gate, merely whether it is functional or not. With access to multiple gates, one can triangulate the approximate location of the other gates as well. I have developed a proprietary method of monitoring gate traffic as well--I can't tell what moves through, but I can tell which gates are active and how frequently.

== Security ==
The crystals also form the security system for the gate network. There are symbol sequences that put the DHD and crystal into various states. These might be divided into gate access protocols and system readiness states. It is possible to set a gate into Incoming only, open mode even without a keystone, but such incoming connections require more power and can only stay open for 19 minutes instead of 38.

Gate Access Protocols determine who is authorized to make connection requests from a DHD. These range from totally open, where anyone physically capable of touching the DHD controls can activate the gate, to fully restricted where only specific individuals, as determined by soul aura, can activate the gate or can request an incoming connection. Most often, gates are put in password-protected mode--the user must input a specific sequence (determined at mode selection) to unlock the gate before outgoing connections can be made. A password can be set for establishing an incoming connection as well--this can be identified because after entering the gate code, an ascending sequence of 4 notes will sound at the outgoing gate. The user must then enter the desired password in order for the connection to be established. Fully open is the default state for a newly-initialized gate.

System Readiness States determine what kinds of connections can be made.

; Disabled : This state disallows all incoming and outgoing connection requests. A harsh buzzing noise will sound if you attempt to activate a disabled gate without first inputting the re-initialization sequence.
; Incoming only : This state only allows incoming connections. Attempts to initialize an outgoing connection will fail with the same harsh buzzing noise, this time in a descending sequence.
; Outgoing only : This state only allows outgoing connections. Attempts to initialize an incoming connection will fail with the same harsh buzzing noise as for a failed incoming connection.
; Open : This state allows both directions of connections. This is the default state for a new gate.
As a note, none of these restrictions apply to the use of the portal as a destination for a ''teleport circle'', ''teleport'', or ''planeshift'' spell. This means that physical security must be maintained as well, even if the access protocols are locked down or the gate itself is disabled. Same goes for cysgoroesi transit methods. A cysgor connection can be identified because the portal that forms is black rather than silver.

Currently, the portals controlled by the [[Adventurer's Guild]] are mostly open to merchants. Merchants must be vetted (including under truth spell) and must pay 5,000 FNC gold coins, agree to participate in the adventurer support network, and pay an ongoing tithe (on a sliding scale based on profitability) on all goods and people transmitted through the gate. Generally, merchants sub-contract with vetted couriers who maintain gate access, paying the tithe and an additional fee to that courier for safe transit.

== Comprehensive Enumeration of Portal Exits ==
Update: A listing of existing network exits and portal sequences was recovered by a team of adventurers in Godsfall in late summer of 210 AC. As such, all known exits are now available if the portal responds. The names are those listed in this listing. Control of network exits is still unknown, however.

== Nations and Civilizations of Western Noefra ==
[[File: West-Noefra-250.png|frameless|800px|Political areas of Western Noefra, ca 250 AC]]

===The [[Federated Nations]] Council===
Established in 204 AC through the actions of the Catalysts (a group of adventurers-turned-heroes), the FNC serves as an opportunity for the four nations (and one tribal group) that occupy Central-Western [[Noefra]] to communicate and solve problems peacefully. Each member nation has two representatives. The representatives from the Wind-walker Goblin Collective chair the council as neutral parties. It is headquartered at [[Fort Hope]] in the central plains along with the [[Adventurer's Guild]].

==== The Adventurer's Guild and Adventurers ====
Main article: [[Adventurer's Guild]]

Once a part of the [[Council Lands]] and composed of convicted criminals given a second chance, the [[Adventurer's Guild]] has been given to the FNC as the problem-solving arm of the council. Now a voluntary organization that draws from all the nations, it has been given the responsibility to oversee the adventurers and [[Registered Companies]]. Most of the actual adventuring and request-fulfillment is now done by those adventurers in their companies. These adventurers go out and discover new things, handle problems for both individuals and governments, and generally act as the lubricant of Noefran civilization.

====Nations of the Council====
[[Asai'ka (Nation)|Asai'ka]] : Located in the central region of the [[Jungle of Fangs]], this wealthy nation has become dominated by religion and money.

[[Auringon]] : A small nation of high elves and humans, the Auringon lived in peace for generations on the [[Lost Coast]]. Recently, a wave of refugees fleeing the expansionist [[Tlalocana]] have upset their order. As of 251 AC, they have signed a treaty of union, preparatory to entry into the Council.

[[Byssia]] : Trapped between the [[Mountains of Night]] and the [[Gap-tooth Bay]], this nation is home to elves and humans. Known for their refusal to worship the [[Congregation]], they are the foremost practitioners of the druidic arts. To the east is the savage [[Blood-thirst Wildlands]]; to the west is [[Auringon]] and the threat of the [[Tlalocana]] lurking in the south around the bay.

[[Crisial Kingdom]] : Founded on the southern shore of [[Lake Coy'in]] from the union of part of the [[Council Lands]] with the [[Horse Clans]] of the [[Lupaus Plains]], the Crisial Kingdom strives to be a shining light to the world, showing the beneficial side of arcane magic, mixed with benevolence.

The [[Duarchy of Kotimaa]] : Covering the region to the north of the [[Sea of Grass]] as well as part of [[Kotimaa]], the Duarchy is really two nations, united in their desire not to be ruled by anyone else. From the variegated peoples of [[Godsfall]] to the proud nobles of [[Dreamshore]], the Kotimaans are a sturdy lot with much history (mostly in ruins).

The [[Free State of Rauviz]] : A merchant-run city-state on the eastern shore of [[Lake Coy'in]], Rauviz is a center of trade and has taken the mantle of most cosmopolitan city. All types can be found here, and anything can be bought and sold.

The [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]]: Covering the [[Sea of Grass]] and down into the badlands of [[Moon's Fall Vengeance]], the wall-builders of the HKR believe in faith and community. A theocratic republic, they believe themselves led by the gods. Their neighbors aren't so sure.

The [[Serpent Dominion]] : The southernmost of the nations of the [[Jungle of Fangs]], the SD is a caste-oriented, very religious nation of humans, half-elves, and [[ophidian]]s. They've started expanding into the [[Blood-thirst Wildlands]] to the west across Coiled Rock Bay.

[[Sha'slar Autonomous Zone]] : Theoretically a military dictatorship, the SAZ is the northern of the three nations of the [[Jungle of Fangs]]. In reality, it has little centralization and most of its towns act independently, more like a bunch of allied city-states. Optimistic and welcoming, the SAZ is growing rapidly.

The [[Uulan Confederacy]] : Buried under the [[Ringwall Mountains]] to the east of the [[Sea of Grass]], the UC is a dwarven-dominated collection of clan-holds and associated hangers-on. Traditional and rock-ribbed, the Uulanites dare the waves of change break themselves on their stony selves--they will abide it all.

[[Wyrmhold]] : Emerging from nearly 100 years of existential struggle against an implacable foe, the [[dragonborn]], [[orcs]], and [[goblins]] of [[Wyrmhold]] have taken to expanding in all directions. The most technologically-advanced nation, the Wyrmholders are focusing most of their attention onto the [[Nocthean Caldera]].
=== Other Nations===
The [[Abandoned Clans]] : Dwarven survivors of the [[Cataclysm]] and betrayal, the Abandoned have carved out a niche in the [[Giant Spine Mountains]]. Considered barbaric by most, their society glorifies greed and physical strength.

[[Khaimal]] : A literal city state, [[Khaimal]] only claims the land within the walls of the formerly-ruined city of [[Hammerhead]]. Xenophobic, these blazing dwarf-cousins refuse all contact with the outside with extreme predjudice.

[[Darkhold]] : A myth. Whispered only among the criminal element of [[Asai'ka (City) | Asai'ka]], this underground civilization of dark-skinned elves supposedly exists under the badlands of [[Moon's Fall Vengeance]].

[[Shinevog]] : Founded by dwarves from [[Fuar Uulan]] who rejected the traditional ways, this city-state in the foothills of the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] believes in progress at any cost.

The [[Ship People]] : Dwelling on the islands in the [[Primal Sea]], these are pirates and slavers. They've established a small foothold at [[Marchnad Duu]] at the southern tip of the [[Jungle of Fangs]]; their treaty gives them access but denies them the right to raid or trade slaves there.

[[Tuura Adam]] : The mountain people, this nation of [[jazuu]] lives by their Code in the [[Giant Spine Mountains]]. Not numerous, but skilled, they mainly keep out of the business of the lowland nations.

[[Zhapai Karmap]]: The Wild Hold, founded in 212 by the [[Wild Cards]] on the site of an abandoned dwarven hold, lives up to its name. It is a haven for those who do not fit elsewhere. Especially if their misfit nature has gotten them in trouble. They extend refuge to anyone who can live up to their few, but exceedingly harsh laws. Considered a rogue state by most other nations for their inability to play nice and accept constraints on their freedoms.

== Nations and Civilizations of [[Soefra]] ==
[[Ikela]] : One of three human nations in the [[Great Rift]] alongside North and South [[Ithemba]], the nation of [[Ikela]] shares its territory with the [[kalasaa]]. A monarchy with strong religious roots, it is recovering from a deep infection by a devil-worshiping cult. '''Note''': Ikela has no contact with [[Noefra]].

[[Ithemba]] : Two nations in the central [[Great Rift]], these nations are connected to the northern continent via [[Portal Network]]. Known for their devotion to the gods, especially [[Kela Loran]], the two have a long and ugly history; while the demonic infestation that consumed the North was cleansed by the [[Southern Heroes]], the land is still recovering. The South suffers from corruption and indolence.

[[Kel'tan]] : The Phoenix Empire was long the most isolated nation, hiding behind magical and physical walls. Recent events, including the death of the Emperor and most of his court, have shaken this [[gwerin]] nation to the core.

      <text bytes="4764" sha1="brag1r222rda3g7u35605lxuwmruxk1" xml:space="preserve">The Council Lands was a nation in central-western [[Noefra]] from about 25 AC until 227 AC. Founded by refugees fleeing from the after-effects of the [[Cataclysm]], it centered around the mountain fortress-city of [[Kaelthia]] and the [[Granite-Flame Academy]] and [[Temple of the Four]] established there.

== History ==

=== Early Years ===
Founded within a few years after the [[Cataclysm]] by refugees from the [[Flower Kingdom]] and other survivors, plus dwarves migrating from the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] in the wake of the devastation. The [[Refuge Seekers]] were instrumental in this foundation. Choosing a small Byssanthian noble's domain along the [[Outer Barrier Range]] who offered them shelter, they founded a city nearby, [[Kaelthia]], with its [[Granite-Flame Academy]] (devoted to protecting the fragments of history left after the cataclysm) and the [[Temple of the Four]] (originally dedicated to the [[Old Gods]], but gaining its new purpose once the new [[Congregation]] arose). The dwarven refuge of [[Fuar Uulan]] joined the nascent nation.

Unlike most of the nations before it, it renounced aristocracy and structured its society around communal agreement and consensus. It grew slowly, with [[Rauviz City]] being the first significant satellite city, followed by [[Baile Craan]]. But still most of the people cowered behind walls, afraid of the horrors that they were sure lurked outside. They were convinced that they and only they had survived the [[Cataclysm War]] and that only orcs, goblins, and other monsters roamed the wasteland beyond the walls.

=== Golden Age ===
Starting in about 150 AC, the fear of the outside started to recede. More and more villages were formed and the [[ihmisi]] of the southern forests of [[Kotimaa]] joined the nation. In about 200 AC, the town of [[Yuuras Zaali]] (now known as [[Crisial City]]) was founded. Adventurers (drawn involuntarily for the most part from convicted criminals) were dispatched to outlying areas to help stabilize the regions. In 205 AC, the [[Catalysts]] were sent to [[Yuuras Zaali]]...and the rest is history.

The Council Lands became the strongest, most populated nation and the core of the [[Federated Nations]], with members of the [[Catalysts]] still residing at [[Hound's Rest]] outside [[Kaelthia]]. Soon after, [[Godsfall]] was restored and [[Shinevog]] and [[Zhapai Karmap]] were founded...with the CL acting as the gateway to all three. Massive amounts of wealth and foreigners poured through the nation.

=== Unrest ===
The cracks in the system of government, which had become quite corrupt and self-serving, became much more apparent with this flood of newcomers and money. The outlying regions began heavily distrusting the old, wealthy center. The deaths of [[Adrik and Bardryn Tsetseg]] in 217 AC (about the same time the [[Crystal Spire]] appeared) sparked an (unfounded, mostly) fear that the [[Southshore]] region was threatening to secede from the nation and had assassinated the dwarven exemplars as part of that plot. So a militia was rallied and dispatched to "investigate". The people of [[Yuuras Zaali]] and the surroundings, who had also become wealthy as the crossroads with the western nations, rallied a force in response. They met outside the [[Crystal Spire]], but before battle could be joined, a team of adventurers under FNC command, aided by several dragons, stepped in and quelled it, forcing the two sides to a compromise. The nation was reformed along more republican, representative democratic lines. The rule of the [[Guildmasters]] was over.

=== Republic of Federated Free Peoples ===
The RFFP moved its new capital to [[Rauviz]] in an attempt at a fresh start. This lasted uneasily for a decade. During this time, [[Yuuras Zaali]] was renamed [[Crisial City]] and grew tremendously, as did [[Rauviz]]. The old guard in [[Kaelthia]] became bitter.

=== Coup, Civil War, and Breakup ===
Eventually, the [[Guildmasters]]' plot in 227 led to the "death" of the dragon [[Marcia (Dragon)|Marcia]] to an assassin's cursed and enchanted crossbow (aimed at the [[Immortal Bard]]). This led to three years of civil war. Not ''hot'' civil war, but mostly raiding, skirmishes between various parties, and other low-level guerilla warfare.

In 230 AC, the [[Treaty of Rauviz]] was signed, formally dissolving the RFFP and the Council Lands, creating the [[Successor States]] in its place.

      <text bytes="4721" sha1="ag2lxij93jtm067lfoxfzlt1hacestg" xml:space="preserve">As the name suggests, the Council Lands were ruled by a council. Officially there is a pair of leaders (The [[Immortal Bard]] and [[Marcia_Dragon|Marceline]] the brass dragon), but they rarely participated in the council.

== The Council ==
The ruling council of the Council Lands is composed of two members from each of the following categories:

; The Temple : Represented by the [[Hand of Mercy]] and the [[Sun's Fist]].
; The Academy : Represented ca 211 AC by [[Tome-Master Korthan]] and [[Brightsong Dovara]]
; Agriculture : Represented ca 211 AC by [[Thorngage Bree]] and [[Darvin Fallowfield]]
; Mining : Represented ca 211 AC by [[Adrik and Bardryn Tsetseg]]

The ostensible head of the Council is the [[Immortal Bard]], but he’s rarely if ever around. In fact, in 204 AC he hasn’t been seen for almost 10 years. In reality either Darvin or the Fist are in charge depending on topic. Korthan leads the wizards’ side of the Academy and Dovara the bardic side. Bree represents the halfing farmers; Adrik and Bardryn are husband and wife and represent the dwarven community.

== The Granite-Flame Academy of Wizardry and Bard-craft ==
Main Article: [[Granite-Flame Academy]]

Founded by a wizardess who escaped the final battle of the [[Cataclysm]] War on the back of her friend the brass dragon who formerly was the sorceress [[Marcia_Dragon|Marceline]]. Together with the [[Immortal Bard]], the [[Rageborn Colossus]], and she who became the [[Handmaiden]] of the [[Melara|Merciful Lady]], they created a refuge for the harried, starving survivors of the [[Cataclysm]]. The Academy was founded about 10 years after the Cataclysm to research the changed arcane environment and to study ways of using magic in this new world. From there it grew to be the only source of organized magical training for wizards throughout the civilized lands. A school of bard-craft was added about 20 years later.

The Academy is composed of 9 Schools (one for each discipline of Magic and one for Bardic Magic). Each school has a headmaster and between 2 and 14 faculty members. In total there are 46 seated faculty and 112 students. The bard college is the largest; the school of necromancy is the smallest at 3 faculty members and 4 students.

Politically, the Academy and its Archmage [[Brynmor sur Golau]] are neutral (officially). Unofficially, they are advocates of expansion and exploration. One major priority is the recovery of arcane artifacts.

==The Temple of the Four==
Main Article: [[Temple of the Four]]

The center of the religious life of the Council Lands (especially the capital) is the Temple of the Four. Dedicated to the 4 primary Gods of the civilized lands (The [[Melara|Lady of Mercy]], The Sun-lord, The Shadowed Sun, and the Lady of the Dawn), there are minor shrines to several other of the gods. The Temple also serves as the administrative center for the orders serving each of these deities. The largest branch is the Sunshield Order, the paladins and clerics of the Sun-Lord. This order is also the core of the military, serving as trainers and backbone to the citizen militia.

Politically the Temple is conservative, opposing rapid change in culture or politics. Protection and monster hunting are the most common types of missions given by Temple agents.

== Other Political Forces ==
Although the Council is the ostensible ruling body, the most significant groups in the Council Lands are the Guilds. These organizations control the economy and culture of civilization. There are many guilds but they organize under a few banners.

=== Mining ===
The Mining Guild controls the mining, refining, and manufacturing of metal goods. Masonry and stonework also falls under their influence. The guild is dominated by the dwarven clans of Tsetseg and Khulan. Politically the Mining Guild is very conservative, disliking change in any way. Not expansionist.

=== Forestry ===
The Forester’s Guild provides wood products for building and fuel as well as fruits and hunting. Forestry is represented on the Council by Agriculture. Politically neutral and independent.

=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture represents the rural folk and food production. They are the most organized and politically active of the major guilds. Religious and culturally conservative. Always looking for more land. Allies with the Temple. Strongly disliked the founding of the Federated Nations.

=== Commerce ===
Commerce represents the economy. Youngest major Guild. Commerce suffered a great loss in prestige and power when the [[Catalysts]] uncovered the [[Dark Lady]]'s agents working within the guild to undermine the Council Lands.

      <text bytes="2771" sha1="lkjrpkamw84nx4452fhlizzuct9923d" xml:space="preserve">His true name lost when he gained immortality (agelessness, rather), the Bard was part of the adventuring party that survived the Final Battle of the [[Cataclysm War]] and led the surviving refugees south to found [[Kaelthia]]. Since then he has wandered restlessly, looking for new sights and sensations. Well, that and fleeing any form of responsibility or commitment. Some wags calculate that he's related to half of the half-elves of the Council Lands. In fact, it's common for a mother who does not wish to publicly state the father of her child to claim him as Bard's-get. Orphans whose names are not known are tagged with the family name of Bardsyn, which has become synonymous with illegitimacy or unsanctioned parentage.

Pre-211: He only rarely gets involved in the Council's affairs, but seems to pop up at inconvenient times for those scheming for power. Most of the powerful people believe that he has some way of teleporting back to [[Kaelthia]] as well as a well-developed spy network. It's known that [[Brightsong Dovara]] is his daughter and the lyricists are assumed to be working for him. The rest of the [[Council Lands Government|Council]] (with the exception of the Mining representatives) dislikes him strongly and often act spitefully towards those who claim his favor. He also has massive quantities of blackmail on all the important people of the land and can spread rumors like none else.

Post-211: After the [[Treaty of Rauviz]], the Bard has not been seen much. Those that have seen him say that he has become much more hardened and bitter.

Post-250: After [[Enigma]] healed [[Marcia (Dragon)]], he and she have returned and now make their home in the [[Crisial Kingdom]].

; Demographic Information: The Bard is a young-seeming half-elf, seemingly careless and happy-go-lucky. His hair and beard are brown and short. He stands about 6' tall and is slender and graceful. Only his green eyes betray his age. They're constantly scanning the surroundings and noting everything that happens. He dresses in simple clothes except for his capes, which are all long, billowing (as if enchanted) and extravagant. Mechanically he's a low tier 2 bard with a collection of magical gewgaws and tricks he's picked up here and there.

; Personality: Whenever I come to a new place, I collect local rumors and spread gossip.

; Ideal: Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them.

; Bond: [[Marcia_Dragon|Marcialine]] is my responsibility. She got hurt trying to save me. I will protect her until she wakes up, however long that takes.

; Flaw: I hate to admit it and will hate myself for it, but I'll run and preserve my own hide if the going gets tough.

; Alignment: CG

Naturally gregarious, she spent much of her time in human form mingling with the common folk. She was known to “request” (order) people to come to her lair and tell her stories. In return she payed them out of the treasures she’d acquired since the Cataclysm. She and the [[Immortal Bard]] are good friends, both having been adventurers in the same band at the time of the Cataclysm.

She will not tolerate chaos within the domain she claims, but rarely gets involved in politics. She exercises the ultimate veto over the Council. 

She is currently in a state of healing sleep in an undisclosed location outside of the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]] after being attacked by assassins working for the [[Guildmasters]] in 227 AC. 

Note (250 AC): She has been awoken by [[Enigma]] and, along with the [[Immortal Bard]], has returned and taken up residence in [[Crisial Kingdom]].

; Demographic Information: Marcia is an adult brass dragon (MM) spellcaster. When transformed, her eyes often betray her by flashing deep red when she gets excited or angry.

; Personality: Words? Words! Stories! I love stories. Tell me more stories!

; Ideal: Free Thinking. Inquiry and curiosity are the pillars of progress.

; Bonds: This city is MINE. Anyone who threatens it will die. Slowly. But not too painfully, because that’s just unnecessary.

; Flaw: Easily distracted by Oh, shiny! Has a hard time focusing on the here and now, prefers to live in a world of stories.

; Alignment: CG, near the CN border

      <text bytes="8742" sha1="2y6rpemgeotx8yaa3dgxsrdxw6nk2p1" xml:space="preserve">There are several languages commonly (or less-commonly) used in the known world as of 250 AC. Some are tied to race--of these only one is genetically tied to race: Ngyon Toi, the [[Goblins|goblin]] language. All the rest are heritage languages. Included in this list are a few archaic languages and some external languages that characters might encounter.

== Common Languages of the Federated Nations ==
These languages are the first and second languages of most of Western [[Noefra]]. Their sounds and written forms are unremarkable throughout the area.

=== Common ===
Almost every humanoid (and many non-humanoids) in Western Noefra speaks Common as either a first or a second language. It is the descendant of Old Imperial, the lingua franca of the Western Empire. In the 800 years since the Fall of Empire, it has broadened and changed. Still, it's mostly mutually intelligible across the half-continent. Humans and halflings, as well as the demi-races (half-elves, half-orcs, dragonborn, tieflings, aasimar and genasi) usually speak it as a first language. Elves, dwarves, orcs, serpent-kin, and goblins speak it as a second language. The real-world equivalent is English. The script used is called Reformed Imperial, and is a direct modification (and simplification) of Old Imperial characters.

==== Dialects ====
; Council Dialect: The "standard" dialect, this is spoken in the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]] and the [[Crisial Kingdom]]. Equivalent to the Received Pronunciation of English.

; Northern Dialect: Spoken in the [[Duarchy]], this dialect is influenced by Metsae and is noted to be a sing-songy and fluid.

; Southern Dialect: Spoken throughout the [[Jungle of Fangs]], this dialect is heavy on sibilants and nasal sounds.

;Mountain Dialect: Spoken in [[Wyrmhold]], this dialect tends to chop the ends of words off.

;Water Dialect: Spoken in [[Byssia]], this dialect of common employs many unique words and fewer specific nouns. Things are described, often poetically.

=== Metsae [MET-say] (Wood Elf) ===
The racial wood-elf language, a form of this is spoken by most tribally-oriented wood elves. It is a slowly-changing language, so it is often used for first attempts at communication with widely-separated tribes because it's unlikely to have changed since they last met. Metsae is written in a compressed version of the flowing elven script, but without the geometric patterning of Yonwach. The real-life base language is Finnish.

=== Yonwach [YON-watch] (High Elf) ===
The ancestral language of high elves, this language is carefully preserved. New words are added occasionally, but the grammar and structure has been unchanged for millennia. Its written form is elven characters. For all but the most disposable writings, the characters and words are arranged into geometric constructs (nested spiraling polygons, arcs, interlocked rings, etc)--different paths through the text reveal different meanings and subtexts. Translating it is notoriously difficult. The real-life base language is Welsh.

=== Ard-teang [ar-TAŋ] (Orc) ===
A guttural tongue, Ard-teang is the cultural language of the northern orcish tribes. Although they tolerate outsiders learning the vernacular form, the sacred dialects are off limits to those not accepted by the tribes. When written, Ard-teang is vertically-oriented and uses heavily modified elven characters interspersed with runic elements. The real-life base language is Irish Gaelic.

=== Tumni [TOOM-ni] (Dwarf) ===
Spoken by dwarves, [[Tumni]] is a language unlike most others. Its closest relative is Too-til, the giant language. Written in dwarven script, which is a debased runic script, [[Tumni]] is written in 4x4 square blocks of characters and can be read in multiple directions. Lying in written [[Tumni]] is a mortal insult to any traditional dwarf. The real-life base language is Mongolian.

=== Ngyon Toi [ŋyan TOY] (Goblin) ===
Ngyon Toi is unique in that it's dominantly genetically transmitted. Goblins are born knowing how to speak it. Since a large fraction of communication between goblins is semi-telepathic through their shared memory, spoken ngyon toi is clipped and staccato, with much left unsaid. When spoken by outsiders (who don't share this racial connection) or between members of different tribes, Ngyon toi requires significant verbosity and circumlocutions. Objects are described. There is no written form, although transliterations have been made into several scripts and educated goblins can usually write in Common. The real-life base language is Vietnamese.

== Archaic Languages ==
Two such languages are detailed here, although many others exist. These are languages that are either dead (no native speakers) or almost so and are mainly found in written form on monuments and ruins.

=== Old Imperial (Dead) ===
The base language of western humanity, the national language of the Western Empire, this is the main academic written language of the Federated Nations. Found all over pre-cataclysm facilities and artifacts, any serious scholar would know how to read Old Imperial. The base language is Latin.

=== Iath Neidr [Yath Neer] ===
Almost dead, this language is only spoken by the tribes of serpent-kin that escaped captivity in the Stone Throne. The older dialects are found across Fanged Kingdom buildings, ruins, and artifacts. Written in an archaic form of elven script, the base language is Khmer (Cambodian).

== Other Languages ==
These languages are sometimes encountered by adventurers, but they're not the native tongues of anyone living in the [[Federated Nations]].

=== Ithemban [ith-EM-ban] ===
Spoken in the nations of [[North Ithemba]] and [[South Ithemba]], this language is related to [[Yonwach]] but has drifted heavily both in spoken and written forms. It is the lingua franca of the [[Great Rift]] area. 

=== Draconic ===
The language of dragons and sorcery, this language is learned (at the elementary level) by dragonborn of [[Wyrmhold]] as part of becoming adults. Real dragons say that dragonborn speak "kiddie" draconic. Extremely complicated in grammar and syntax, some of the words involved are hundreds of syllables long and any mispronunciation alters the meaning tremendously. Much of the meaning is conveyed by body/wing/tail posture, which is difficult for those without wings or tails. Dragon names tend to accrete throughout their lives, reaching thousands of syllables for the most ancient ones. The base language for draconic is Old Church Slavonic. Draconic is not written natively, but transliterations into elven or dwarven script exist.

=== Runic ===
This language of power was used by the Titans in the First Age. Only fragments still remain, and only in written form. Any spoken versions are extrapolations, guesses at best. It is similar in form (but significantly more complicated) than Bidni-khel or Too-til, its descendant languages. There is no base language for runic.

=== Too-til (Giant) ===
A relative of Tumni and a fellow descendant of Runic, Too-til is spoken by the [[Jazuu]] of [[Noefra]]. Written in ideographs composed of multiple runic elements, the base language is Kyrgyz.

=== Lucian [LOO-shan] ===
There are two forms of this language--one spoken by those on divine missions (Celestial or High Lucian) and one spoken by summoned astral beings (Infernal). The primary difference is that Celestial is infused with magic so that anyone can understand it and lying is impossible. When spoken by mortals, it is not impossible to lie but the language structure promotes clarity of thought and communication. Everything is explicit, no implication. Uncertainty is clearly marked.

Infernal (or Low Lucian) is a slang form of the same base language and is the dominant working language of the astral plane. It is almost the inverse of High Lucian--almost all meaning is implicit and the language encourages circumlocutions, strategic ambiguity, and other forms of deception while technically telling the truth.

Demons also tend to speak infernal (as well as whatever language they learned as mortals, if that was where they started). They also speak Abyssal, which is a hybrid language of all of the spoken languages of the world. Known for it being hard to express true sincere emotion, especially love or loyalty, in Abyssal. It comes across as quite flat, while at the same time harsh.

There is no real-life base language for these.

=== Elemental (Primordial) ===
This family of languages is spoken by creatures native to the elemental planes. These languages are largely mutually comprehensible when spoken by natives. Mortals tend to speak in a mishmash of languages depending on exactly how they learned it. The base language is Arabic.

      <text bytes="13643" sha1="2tflr7kjtkuhkaxnuiatuoztw661snq" xml:space="preserve">== Origin ==
Humans only date back about 5 thousand years, to the [[Ages of the World|Interregnum]] between the Second Age and the dawn of the Third Age. It's said that the [[gwerin]], after the splitting off of [[Soefra]] with the majority of their surviving people, knowing that they did not have the numbers  to contest for mastery with the surging [[Puun Ihmisia|ihmisi]] populations and their [[Goblins|goblin]] and [[Dwarves|dwarven]] allies, decided to create their own "obedient" soldiers. They took tribe after tribe of goblins, forced them to evoke as many hobgoblins as possible, and then wielded the last of the great bio-magics to blend aelven traits into the hobgoblins, fixing them so they wouldn't revert back to goblins but also giving them fertility. True to form, however, for the descendants of Chaos, the resulting hybrids (later called humans) were anything but loyal and obedient. Sure, many of them fought alongside the [[gwerin]]. But mostly, they went their own way. Their rapid breeding, along with that of the [[orcs]] (who were created by the other side for many of the same reasons and in much the same way, although with primal magics instead of arcane bio-magics), led to a stalemate. And then erupted the [[War of Blood]], ending in the Third Wish and the birth of the gods. Humans, with their desire to believe in and worship something greater than themselves (a trait that some gwerin researchers believe was designed to make them worship the elves!), took to the new ways with a vengeance. And their sociability and willingness to live alongside other groups led to them leading the two great empires of the Third Age, [[Tibor Imperia]] and the [[Jinse Empire]]. During the Third Age, humans spread to [[Soefra]] and even as far as the western shore of [[Oelfra]]. It truly was the Age of Humans.

Since then, humans have played a major, if not totally dominant, role in the events of [[Noefra]]. It's a rare nation that has no human presence--the only major nation of that sort is [[Wyrmhold]], and the numbers there are growing. And even Wyrmhold is highly influenced by the human gregariousness and devotion to [[Ascendant|Ascendants]] of all types.

== Ethnicities of the Federated Nations ==
Humans in the Federated Nations belong to one of three rough ethno-cultural groups, distinguished by culture and ancestry. These three groups are the Wall-Builders of the Council Lands, the Fang-kin of the Stone Throne, and Night's Children in Byssia.

=== Wall-Builders ===
The most common folk of the former [[Council Lands]] are the humans called "wall-builders" by other races for their propensity to build walls around every settlement, even if the threat doesn't really warrant it. Descended from refugees from many nations that found themselves thrown together seeking for safe haven after the Cataclysm. As a result of the genetic bottleneck caused by the massive casualties attendant to the Cataclysm, the wall-builders have homogenized greatly. Outwardly, they have the following traits:

* Medium-brown, warm-toned skin (cafe-au-lait). Darker shades are rare, but lighter shades are not unknown.
* Dark brown-to-black hair, mostly wavy or curly. While this is the most common shade, throwbacks to other ethnicities are common and unremarkable--red hair, blond hair, etc. 
* Short, stocky stature. Only hardy individuals survived, and compactness meant less bulk to feed. They tend to stand 5'2" to 5'6" tall, with women as tall as men. Taller individuals are uncommon, with 6'0" rarely reached by anyone. Obesity is becoming more common. Tastes in attractiveness tend to the well-fed and curved.
* Squared-off facial features with short noses and square jaws.
* Dark eyes. As with hair color, there is substantial variation to all various colors, including ones not found on Earth.

Culturally and by training, wall-builders are diverse. Some have grown up with the [[ihmisi]] of the frontiers--others in the comfort of [[Rauviz|Rauviz's]] trade halls or among the elite [[gwerin]]-heavy environments of [[Crisial City]]. Wall-builders all speak the Common tongue (as does everyone else), but many also have learned other languages (especially for cursing). Wall-builders worship gods across the pantheon although most place the Four Seasons high in their veneration.

Due to a shortage of competent individuals, most of the gender-based cultural requirements vanished after the Cataclysm War. Women are as likely as men to lead guilds or to work in all areas of life. Wall-builders come of age at 14 and marry by 17 (mostly). The average age at death (old age only) is about 80. Marriages are (in theory) monogamous, but adultery is not unknown. As family lines are important, children are recorded based on blood--illegitimate children go with the mother but fathers are recorded (in secret if nowhere else). Illegitimacy is not a serious stigma. Widows and widowers tend to remarry quickly. There is no expectation of the inheritance following the eldest child (male or female).

Wall-builders use names following the pattern &lt;Given&gt; &lt;Profession&gt;. Children in the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]] are not given surnames until they are Judged and assigned a profession. Others generally follow their parents' professions and choose one of those (or their own if they choose a different path).

Common male names include: John, William, James, George, Charles, Henry, Robert, and Thomas.

Common female names include: Anna, Emma, Elza, Margaret, Ida, Clara, and Alice.

=== Fang-kin ===
Unlike the wall-builders, the fang-kin are mostly a single strain of humanity. Most common in the Stone Throne, these peoples were enslaved by the Fanged Kingdom until about 800 years ago. Their eladrin masters magically bred traits of their favored serpents into their slave race. While those most changed by this forced mutation became the Serpent-kin, even the normal human folk had some changes that have stuck. Since the disappearance of the overlords, the fang-kin have also interbred with the lower-caste elves left behind. Those whose elven heritage is strongly-pronounced are considered half-elves; despite this there are elven traits apparent even in the most human of the inhabitants. Fang-kin have the following physical traits:

* Light, cool-toned skin. Patterns of colored blotches (like large freckles) are common, especially on the head, neck, and upper torso and upper arms. These often flush and darken with anger or excitement. 
* Wild variation in hair color. Hair is most often a pure jewel or metallic tone--jet black, brilliant silver, golden yellow, ruby red and amethyst purple are the most common, but greens and blues are not uncommon. Most have multiple shades or streaks.
* Tall, slender stature. Graceful movement is the default. Most individuals are between 5'5" and 6'2", with some variation outside this. Women are slightly shorter than men, but not tremendously. Obesity is very rare. The ideal of * feminine beauty is minimal curves and slender lines. Strong fang-kin rarely develop much visible musculature.
* Elongated oval facial features.
* Grey-to-green eyes. Some change in the light or with mood.

Culturally, the Fang-kin tend toward social hierarchies and status competition. Respect for (or fear of) nobility is bred in deep. These trends are less dominant outside of [[Asai'ka]], where the old nobility still holds strongest sway. Fang-kin are generally quite devout toward the [[Queen Ascendant]], although some also revere others of the gods. Some gender prejudice still exists. Socially dominant men are expected to have many partners/wives/concubines, but women are generally not. The lower classes are much more monogamous and have much less gender prejudice. Women can hold any role in secular life; priestly life still has a gender split. Homosexuality is not stigmatized.  

Being a hierarchical society, the naming conventions vary by class. The three major classes are nobles (including clergy), tradesmen (including soldiers), and commoners. Given names are similar between the three classes, but the structure of the name and the surnames vary. Nobles are formally named Isal &lt;Family name&gt; &lt;Given&gt;. Tradesmen are given the name Lai &lt;Profession&gt; &lt;Given&gt;. Commoners go by &lt;Given&gt; pe &lt;Location&gt;.

Given names are androgynous and include: Balin, Chea, Da, Dara, Leng, Narong, Nimol, Srey, Son, Bopha, Chanda, Khan, Maly, Map, Phalla, Ry, Rith, Thy, Thuy, and Vanna.

Noble family names include: Sat’psa, Hvang, Boeng, and Prei.

=== Night's Children ===
Descended from those Nocthians who fled south out of the [[Nocthian Caldera]] in the aftermath of the [[Cataclysm]], the Night's Children are named so for their hair, which is most often lustrous black, long and straight and their pale skin. Even centuries of interbreeding with the more swarthy locals and with the wood elves has only slightly modified those traits. They tend to show less elven heritage than the Fang-kin, but most show at least some effects. They tend to have the following physical traits:

* Very pale skin. This is nearly uniform--only those who have little Nocthian ancestry deviate from this. They do not burn in the sunlight--the superstitious call it a blessing from the [[Nocthis]], the pre-Cataclysm Goddess of Night and Secrets (now reborn).
* Black hair, usually worn pulled back or pinned up. Almost always straight and long (especially on women). Those with significant elven heritage exhibit mottling of greys on their hair, almost like the shadow of leaves at night. Very occasional red with black undertones.
* Tall, long-limbed stature. Wall-builders refer to them as "living statues." Bulkier than fang-kin, they tend to develop hard curves and muscles quite well, even the women.
* Slightly slanted eyes.
* Eyes ranging from ice-grey to bright jewel tones (including purples and brilliant blues).

Culturally, the Night's Children are egalitarian, community-oriented folk. Gender roles are non-existent. Families are large and the extended family and the whole village generally raise children communally. Since the rebirth of [[Nocthis]], their former anti-theism has waned. Still, many focus their devotion to their honored ancestors and the local [[Kami|spirits]]. 

Bysian humans (and wood elves, the names are similar) are given a name and then, later in life, a cognomen (appellation) is added at the beginning or end of the name.

Common male names include: Admitos, Damon, Adrianos, Aetos, Daphnis, Alkaios, Charklis, Herodis, Ion, Ipparchos, Savvas, and Lambros.

Common female names include: Acathi, Adriani, Danai, Daphne, Dione, Eirene, Galini, Charis, Ippodamia, Sergia, and Sotiria.

== Other Ethnicities ==
Humans exist throughout [[Noefra]] and portions of [[Soefra]]. Small colonies of humans have made crossed the [[Eastward Ocean]] to the islands at the SW of [[Oelfra]]. These humans from outside the [[Federated Nations]] have a number of ethnic variations, some of which are described below.

=== Dinea ===
The dinea [din-AYE-ah] are the human inhabitants of the [[Lost Coast]] and the [[Frozen Coast]], ranging from [[Auringon]] north all the way to the edge of the [[Fiach Wood]]. According to the [[Auringon|Auringonians]], the Dinea are tall, with bulky physiques, light-skinned and often blonde or red haired. They have had no contact from the [[Federated Nations]], so the exact amount of variation is unknown.

=== Duster ===
The humans of the [[Great Eastern Dustlands]] are a motley group, but they do share some common traits. For one, many if not most of them have some significant [[Orcs|orcish]] heritage. This leads to them being squat and tough, with grey undertones to their skin. The rigors of life in the wastes leads to rough skin and early balding for many. Hair and eyes span the gamut.

=== Golden Sun (Jin-ri) ===
The jin-ri ("people of the golden sun") are the most wide-spread of the ethnic groups of eastern [[Noefra]]. They were the ruling ethnicity of the [[Jinse Empire]] at its height. Named in part for their golden-hued skin, they stand about the same height as wall-builders, but tend to be much more slender (both men and women). Their eyes have pronounced epicanthic folds. Their hair tends to be dark (brown and black and red), but their eyes run the gamut. Men tend to have little facial hair on their cheeks, although a goatee/long beard is not uncommon for the older folks.

Modern jin-ri from the heart of [[Jinse]] often show minor signs of infernal influence--sharpened canines, eyes with vertical slits or red/gold coloration, and sometimes a red undertone to their skin. Many add affectations to this, including prosthetic horns or tails, wearing their fingernails long and pointed, or otherwise aping the status of an [[Plane-touched|infernal plane-touched]].

=== Abantu ===
The abantu are the hardy sea-folk of the far north-west. Their nut-brown skin and light hair makes them stand out from the surrounding jin-ri. The men glory in their bushy beards. The women tend to have substantial curves but generally athletic figures. These are the humans that have made it to [[Oelfra]].

=== Ikelan ===
The ikelan humans are the closest to "pure" [[Tibor Imperia|Tibor Imperial]] citizens, having come over during that time period and been isolated from the rest of humanity ever since. They have light skin that tans beautifully, dark hair, and are taller than wall-builders.

=== Ithemban ===
Ithembans are noted for their blue-black skin and dark hair. They stand as tall as night's children, with 6' being not uncommon and share a similar musculature.

      <text bytes="5473" sha1="tn1u86czeuomgmo845ma55zqqdgdc68" xml:space="preserve">Halflings are the youngest race--the first record of a halfling race dates only to about 600 years pre-Cataclysm. It is believed that they diverged from humanity due to the chaotic magical energies being used in the Fall of the Western Empire about that time. Later research discovered that they were descended from goblins who were mutated by those magical energies. Unlike elves, their sub-populations are eusocial as opposed to truly genetic. Halflings are only commonly found in the Sea of Grass, where they were a majority of the pre-Cataclysm population. A very few are found in the northern Jungle of Fangs, where they have founded savage, wild tribes.

Halflings are (comparatively) short-lived and fast-breeding. A genetic quirk in the surviving halfling population after the Cataclysm War led to a population that is severely gender-skewed. About 60% of all halflings are female, with 40% male. Infertility is a pervasive problem among the women, but the fertile halflings make up for it by having short gestations and a tendency toward multiple births (triplets are the mode).  Children are raised as a group by multiple women. Male halflings are sent to other family groupings at maturity. Halflings mature early (considered adult at 10) and only live about 60 years. Halfling society is strongly matriarchal with the oldest woman of each family grouping being the Mother (leader) of the group.

Physically, halflings average 3'6" with the Stout subgroup nearing 4'0" on average. Males are usually shorter and smaller than females. Halflings do not grow beards or facial hair (usually), and their hair is almost always short and tends to stick up. Their ears are slightly pointed and they have pronounced canines. Their eyes have a reflective undercoat like felines.

Socially, halflings are notable for their total lack of fear when facing threats. Since there are always more, there is little care if members of the family are sacrificed for the rest. In times of starvation, cannibalism is not unusual nor is it morally suspect.

The infertile females (called Kliba) form the warrior caste and tend toward the Stout variety. They also are the heavy crafters. The fertile females consider them second-class citizens. Males are considered good for not much except making babies and light house-work. Some families treat them almost like pets. Others are more open-minded. It is rare for a traditional male halfling to interact much with non-halflings.

Halflings tend toward the agricultural life, living in large extended family groups on farms and in the smaller villages. There is not a central halfling racial government. Feuds between families are frequent (including blood-shed), but tend to be short-lived.

Religiously, halflings most commonly worship Loran Hae and Peor-fala (who is said to have been a halfling before her ascension to godhood). Halflings tend toward the divine much more than toward the arcane--halfling wizards are very uncommon, and many of the more bigoted members of other races consider them to be incapable of such complex thought. They don't say this to their faces, as halflings often have quite a volcanic temper.

== Naming ==
Names of halflings are heavily family-based and follow the pattern &lt;Family&gt; &lt;Branch&gt; &lt;Given&gt;. A family might consist of multiple branches spread over a large area--the branch name distinguishes these parts.

Family and branch names are usually places or phrases associated with farming. Given names are similar to Council Lands human names. Kliba use that as their branch name.

== Architecture ==
The two main areas where halflings live are the [[Sea of Grass]] and the northern areas of the [[Jungle of Fangs]]. The latter halflings are tribal and live in huts and villages. The former halflings (of the wall-builder culture) have developed a unique style of architecture, especially in the rural areas. Each branch lives in one or more compounds, with two or three matriarchs and associated males and kliba in each compound. These walled compounds often cluster together, facing a common green. At the back are farmlands, pasturage, and orchards. Connecting the compound to the outside is the Big House--a full-height guest house for tall-folk visitors. Access to the main house is through a small, heavily fortified tunnel. Houses are partially buried under ground, usually with only the top floor and the upper 2-3 feet of the ground floor above ground. Windows are minimal.

The ceilings in halfling compounds tend to be low, often only 5'6". The walls are generally packed earth mixed with straw and other materials. The scarce wood is reserved for roof timbers and interior walls; roofs are thatched. Buildings are curved, with very few hard angles. They generally grow organically, starting with the main oval greatroom; walls get knocked out and new oval rooms get added. Generally, matriarchs each have a private room, while males sleep with a matriarch or more rarely have a room of their own. The furniture is light and movable--each room serves many purposes. Privacy is minimal, especially with dozens of kids underfoot. Kliba and any hired workers live in a separate out-building along with the large kitchens and storage areas. Underground cellars underlie the main house.

      <text bytes="4760" sha1="3ysy5wkmdxobloi99wfgxxmyayqmd7l" xml:space="preserve">The dragonborn are the last remnants of a race of magically-engineered super-soldier race dating back to 800 BC (before cataclysm). Most of the dragonborn race were believed to have been killed at the final battle of the Cataclysm War, fighting for the civilized world. Since the rediscovery of [[Wyrmhold]], the majority of the dragonborn from the former [[Council Lands]] have migrated to that kingdom and been accepted into their clans.

== Physical Traits ==
Dragonborn have different elemental affinities (colors) that are randomly expressed. There is no strong genetic tendency for one color over another.

Female dragonborn tend to be larger (5'10-6'2", 190-250 lbs) than males (5'2"-5'10", 150-200 lbs), but males are more aggressive.

Physically, they appear to be humanoid, scale-covered, tailed people with clawed hands and feet. Their heads have a draconic look, with a snout full of sharp teeth. They have frills and leathery ridges instead of hair. Females tend to have more elaborate frills than males. Their tails are short and stubby and mostly non-functional.

Despite their draconic look, they are warm-blooded mammals that give live birth. Secondary sexual characteristics are minimal, although females do have enlarged breasts and give milk for their children. Their scales are more for show than a proper protective covering, although their skin is relatively insensitive compared to other human-descended creatures. 

== History ==

Dragonborn are magically-altered humans; their ancestors were created by fusing fragments of draconic souls into unborn human children. Since then they have bred mostly true.

== Clans of Wyrmhold ==

The acknowledged aristocracy of [[Wyrmhold]] are the six Dragon-born clans. The clans are:

; Gal, Clan of Fire:
The largest clan, Gal has claimed the capital and surrounding foothills. Proud and powerful, they control most of the government functions. Their flag is a stylized crimson flame, inset into a gold diamond against a black background, with the motto "By Valor and Vigilance". 

; Byarsh, Clan of Lightning:
Byarsh has claimed the southern flank and works with goblin craftsman to create the physical goods and technologies used by the realm. They're relatively high status. Their flag is a silver hand grasping a golden lightning bolt, inset into a golden gear on a field of blue. Their motto is "Victory through Work".

; Syra, Clan of Acid:
Syra anchors the northern flank in the forests. They're a large clan but low in status as they're considered rural bumpkins. Their flag is a green tree on a brown field. Their motto is "Persevering and faithful".

; Khor, Clan of Poison:
Alchemists to the State, Khor has produced many new discoveries. This clan is the least involved in the internal politics of the clans. They're weird and they take pride in being weird. Their flag is three black teardrops on a white field. Their motto is "He fails who risks nothing".

; Anu, Clan of Cold:
The first line of defense against the [[Hungering Frost]] was Clan Anu. Living high up in the mountains, this spartan clan has lost the most in the ongoing wars, but has rebounded in the years since the fall of the Frost and has led the retaking of [[Old Wyrmhold]] and the rest of their ancestral lands in the [[Nocthian Caldera]].Their status has increased with the popularity of [[Catalysts|Catalyst Kalesin]], who was honorarily made a member of this Clan for her contributions against the Frost. Their flag is a white rising sunburst on a blue field. Their motto is "I stand".

; Shakti, Clan of the Queen:
Headed by Queen [[Beatris ka Shakti]], Shakti is the ceremonial heart of the nation. Traditionally kept small, the clan consists of the Queen, her Consort Aodh, and their 6 children, as well as their immediate family members. The whole clan numbers about 85 people. Her Majesty is a young Queen, having ascended to the throne about 50 years ago after her mother died during one of the yearly incursions of the [[Hungering Frost]]. Now elderly, she has delegated most of the day-to-day duties to her daughter, [[Elspeth ka Shakti]]. The royal flag is a crowned golden dragon rampant on a purple field. The motto is "Duty does not rest".

== Naming ==
By convention, all dragonborn use names following the pattern &lt;Given&gt; &lt;Status&gt; &lt;Clan&gt;. The clans are described above, and the status marker is either ka for nobles or vo for the common folk.

Common male dragonborn names include: Aodh, Arthfael, Caderyn, Caomh, Cynbel, Cynwrig, Drustan, Judoc, Maedoc, Nechtan, and Seisyll.

Common female dragonborn names include: Abi, Ailsa, Beathag, Catrina, Beitris, Elspeth, Fiona, Iona, Isobel, Jean, Kenna, Lilias, Mhairi, Morven, Seona, Sheona, and Una.

      <text bytes="2728" sha1="2hz6p632wn35yonsm957m6buesu6bwy" xml:space="preserve">Half-elves are those elves with significant human bloodlines or humans with significant elven blood. Sometimes they are exactly 50-50 mixes, but that's much rarer. 

Unlike the more common races which have distinct phenotypic subgroups, half-elves are a continuum and exhibit significant variation between members of the race. Half-elves with high elf backgrounds tend to be taller than humans with blonde or gem-colored hair. Half-elves with wood elf backgrounds tend to be shorter than humans (but not by much) with darker hair and skin. Half-elves in general have less physical sexual dimorphism than humans. Females tend to have slightly more pointed ears, but that's about it. Half-elves grow more facial hair than elves, but less than humans or dwarves. Physically, half-elves are found with the looks of either of their parent races.

=== Human-dominant Half-elf society (Earth-kin) ===
Although there is little physical polymorphism within the half-elf race, there a significant divide in social attitudes. Those half-elves who take after human-kind rigidly adhere to the meritocratic ideals of human society. In essence, they try to be more human than the humans. This group tends to marry humans wherever possible. They are accepted generally by humans, but rejected strongly by pure elves of both types and are called "mutaverta" (mud-bloods).

=== Wood-elf dominant Half-elf society (Travellers) ===
Those half-elves that take after the wood elves are wanderers and travelling merchants and traders. The closest earthly parallel are the Romani (gypsy) people, although the half-elves will settle for short periods of time (until too many people move in). These are the half-elves that most frequently marry other half-elves.Their social standing has improved tremendously in the Council Lands in recent years.

=== Byssian Half-elves ===
Almost all half-elves in Byssia (and there are a lot of them) are wood-elf dominant. They are just as settled as any other Byssian, however, and are culturally indistinguishable from the human or elven populations (depending on who they live among. 

=== High-elf dominant Half-elf society (Sharp-ears) ===
The smallest group are those that take after the high elves. They prize arcane ability and try to marry into elf families. The high-elves look at them as second-class citizens but cherry-pick the best to be adopted into the families. Humans detest them as wannabes and accuse them of putting on airs. They are very rare outside the capital.

=== Fang-kin ===
The half-elves of the [[Jungle of Fangs]] (a large minority of the population) are descended from high elves. Many of them consider this to be a social status marker.

      <text bytes="5184" sha1="ib7xht0xmiaq855mndv1egn7hh81qnb" xml:space="preserve">Future historians would mark 4 Summer Dawning, 206 AC as the Dawn of the Age of Hope, the Fourth Age, the end of the 2nd Interregnum. The sound of the [[Fourth Wish]], "Mortal hands breathe life into unliving mechanisms" echoed across the world. In its wake a new race arose, innocent and searching. The soul-forged, once contraptions powered by binding Words etched into their cores, now a living race with their own sparks. Arising first in the forests of [[Byssia]] and in the goblin workshops and manufacturies of [[Byarsha]] in [[Wyrmhold]], they set out to forge their own destiny and discover the meaning of their existence.

This is a new playable race.

== Soul-forged ==
The soul-forged awakened in the echoes of the [[Fourth Wish]] in 206 AC. Each gained individuality in the body of a [[construct]] empowered by binding Words. Whereas those constructs were short-lived and halting, body and binding Words poorly integrated, the soul-forged were able and capable. Learning at a tremendous rate, they set out to carve their own place into the world around them. Driving many of them is the desire to learn to create others of their kind. Not all the construct bodies awakened; no one knows why some did and others did not. As of 210 AC, only a few dozen soul-forged are known to exist within the territories of the Federated Nations; almost all are trying to become adventurers. By 250 AC, the total number of soul-forged is approximately 2,000. The rate of awakenings has fallen off over time, but has reached a steady state. 

Each soul-forged is individual--no two share the same appearance beyond the basics. All the Awakened were in the form of a human being--two arms with opposable thumbs, two legs, a head, a torso. Some had detailed faces; others merely porcelain masks. Some had fragmentary memories of past souls that empowered them, others were a completely blank slate. Some were decorated in elaborate patterns, others not at all. Some wear the draperies of mortals, others prefer to go without body coverings.

=== Soul-forged Traits ===
; Ability Score Increase: Your Constitution score increases by 2.
; Age: Soul-forged are new to the world. No one knows how long they will live, but none have died of old age by 250 AC. Each one comes into existence as a blank slate, learning fast. Within a month they are fully adult.
; Size: Soulforged are approximately the size of humans, but there is much variation in height and weight. Steel-skin tend to be larger and bulkier than bark-skin. Both are more dense than humans. Your size is Medium.
; Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
; Living Construct: Even though you were constructed, you are a living creature. You are immune to disease. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal. Unlike most constructs, healing magic and potions works fine on you, as does resurrection magic.
; Hardened Body: Your armor class increases by 1. You can wear armor as normal.
; Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common as well as one other language of your choice.

=== Steel-skin ===
The steel-skin soul-forged were first constructed in the goblin workshops of [[Byarsha]] in the southern area of [[Wyrmhold]]. Made out of metal and crystalline stone, they were built for harsh labor; in the Awakening, it became clear that their minds were like the crystal they were made of--clear and structured, able to learn and form new ideas at a tremendous rate.

; Ability Score Increase: Your Strength and your Intelligence scores increase by 1.
; Tool Proficiency: You gain proficiency in either Mason’s Tools or Blacksmith’s Tools.
; Strong Frame: You count as one size larger for determining how much you can lift, pull, or drag.
; Skill Proficiency: You gain proficiency in your choice of Arcana, Investigation or Nature.
; Bonus Language: You can speak, read, and write Ngyon Toi (Goblin).
; Region of Origin: Byarmarsh

=== Bark-skin ===
The bark-skin soul-forged were originally carved in the forests of Byssia as guardians of the sacred resting places of the honored ancestors. Made out of the various trees with joints of carved stone, they maintain a connection to nature and a keen awareness of their surroundings.

; Ability Score Increase: Your Strength and your Wisdom scores increase by 1.
; Tool Proficiency: You gain proficiency in either Carpenter’s Tools or Woodcarver’s Tools.
; Natural Bond: You know the ''druidcraft'' cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast ''pass without trace'' once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast ''plant growth'' once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Your ability modifier for all these spells is Wisdom.
; Bonus Language: You can speak, read, and write Metsae (Wood Elvish).
; Region of Origin: Byssia

      <text bytes="5663" sha1="kqal3778qtrapzwnk11i400rebizqat" xml:space="preserve">==History==
One of the oldest cities in the Western Empire, the city now known as Godsfall was founded near the beginning of the 3rd Age. In the wake of the 3rd Wish that opened the gates of faith, empowering those with faith in the gods, a temple city was founded in the central hills of northern West Noefra. This city became the devotional capital of the Empire that arose, housing temples to thousands of gods, demigods, devils, and heroes. For a thousand years it remained an ecumenical center of divine learning. By Imperial decree, all priests of official religions had to be trained in the seminaries of Divina Lux (as it was known at the time).

With the fall of the empire, Divina Lux diminished in importance and became somewhat of a backwater. It clung fiercely to its historical pride and continued to train clerics, paladins, invokers, warlocks, and other wielders of divine (or infernal) power. As the Cataclysm approached, the people had sorted themselves into two classes--the divine (upper) class and the infernal (lower) class. They coexisted, uneasily, until the end came.

=== The Fall of Gods ===
As the monstrous, demonic armies of the Nameless swept closer, the warriors and clerics of Luca (a corruption of Lux) made a colossal, desperate gamble. They evacuated all the noncombatants they could, sending them out into the wilds to the south, away from the path of the armies. Then they deliberately lured the enemy, commanded by a ranking Lord of the Abyss, one of the Nameless’s generals (said to be the same Naeblis the Breaker whose summoning sparked the Fall of Empire), to the city. Giving ground only stubbornly despite being horribly outnumbered, the brave clerics channeled the core of the demons into the High Temple district. When they were inside the ancient inner walls, the high priest of a god now forgotten conducted a ritual to empower wards that had been placed all along the walls and throughout the city. These wards were designed to contain the army--and they succeeded. At a terrible cost. Every single defender paid with their own soul, condemning themself to becoming a twisted abomination of an undead creature, soul forever trapped and in agony but active and capable of fighting eternally against the demons they trapped in with them. A bubble of light enveloped the city--that was the last the fleeing survivors saw. They said “a god has fallen to Quartus”; from there the legend of Godsfall started spreading.

=== The Dark Years ===
For approximately 200 years, the city lay in ruins. Over time, some of the outer wards began to fail, but the core wards held strong. As magic returned, the [[Watching Eye]] clan of orcs, feeling regret for the actions of their ancestors, took up a silent vigil in what they called the Green Zone--the south-west sector of the city which had by that time become completely over-run by forest. They did what they could to keep the wards operational, despite lacking much of the arcane and divine might of the builders. No contact was had with any of the trapped souls, either undead or demonic.

=== Reopening and Liberation ===
Main article: [[Liberation of Godsfall (Campaign)]]
Cultists serving the [[Demon Princes|Red Fang]] and [[Demon Princes|White Skull]] infiltrated the city towards the end of 210 AC, stealing a ward-stone and making an opening. The [[Watching Eye]], unable to recover the stone themselves, turned to adventurers who had come to support sages from the [[Society for the Preservation of Antiquities]], attracted by legends of the city's knowledge. Those adventurers, the team later known as the [[Godsfall Champions]], not only recovered the stone but proceeded to mobilize a small army to aid in retaking the city. This later formed the core of the [[Godsfall Alliance]].

And retake it they did. First they cleared the Brightwater region, making alliance with the few sane undead left and destroying the demon cult forces there. They later pressed on into the warded areas and liberated each one in turn. Finally, they reached the heart of the city, the old High Temple district, where [[Kel'dan]], She who Shatters Space, incarnation of the [[Broken Concept]] of Causality lay trapped in a web of memories and souls. Strangely, she did not respond to them with hostility. Instead, she seemed changed by the memories, awaiting rebirth as a new, whole being. She begged their aid in defeating [[Kul'Asad]], the mage-leader of the initial invasion force, now become a demonic overlord plotting to use [[Kel'dan]]'s time-bending powers to gain mastery over the entire world from within the Arcadian Fields district. This they accomplished with the aid of revolutionaries within that district.

They also defeated [[Shelob]], the incarnation of the [[Broken Concept]] of hunger, who had taken up residence in the Acheron district and had moved into Abaddon.

Built about 750 BC to serve as the Western Empire's premiere bio-magical research facility, IR Alpha is buried in a mountain-side in the [[Spina Mountains]] that separate the [[Sea of Grass]] from the [[Jungle of Fangs]]. This was the location where [[Dragonborn]] were first produced in about 600 BC by forcibly combining fragments of draconic souls with unwilling human subjects. Thousands died before a viable, true-breeding race was created. When news leaked of this atrocity, the Empire entered a state of civil war. During that war, IR Alpha was thought to have been destroyed, although no traces were found.

=== Disappearance and Reappearance ===
IR Alpha was not destroyed. It was cut off from time and space. All the physical things in it were preserved as if in stasis, but all the souls experienced the full nearly 800 years of torment, locked in sensory deprivation with only their own thoughts. Only two survived once the facility re-entered the timeline in approximately ~185 AC. Those two survivors were driven insane by the experience, however.

It reappeared in 185 AC; 5 years later it was discovered by [[Corran Scalebender]], a druid and a descendent of the head researcher. Obsessed with dragons, he used a key passed down through generations to reactivate the now-empty facility and conduct research into hybrid creatures using [[Dragons|dragons]] as a source of souls. He spent most of 15 years doing so, and made several creatures. He was assisted by a race of golem-like cloned gnomes. Most are barely sapient; only a few have a significant sense of self.

=== Resolution and Destruction ===
Main Article: [[Tooth and Spell (Campaign)]]
A two-person team of Sanctioned Adventurers arrived in late spring, 210 AC. They infiltrated the facility and began turning the inhabitants against Corran. They first allied with Fibbon (after disrupting the power flow throughout the facility), promising to deal with Corran so that he could transfer IULIA. They then proceeded toward the research wing, where they tricked Tony (Corran's failed red dragon experiment/chief bruiser) into attacking Corran. Corran fled at that point, fearing defeat. On his way, he implemented Code Internal Red Alpha, the distribution of potent knock-out gas throughout the facility. Seeking refuge, the team hid with Elvarg (his cage is exempt from the knock-out gas). With Elvarg's and IULIA's help, the team then infiltrated the central offices and slew Corran in his office as he prepared to sacrifice Tony for more power.

With Corran dead, they faced a choice. Kill IULIA (as she desired), destroying the facility in the process, or leave her alive, letting Fibbon transfer her to a mechanical body but not destroying the facility. They chose the third option--unweave the personalities, separating the Soulminder and the Chief of Security from Iulia and the Librarian. The two warped personalities would stay behind, expiating their guilt in the destruction of the facility. The others would transfer to a new body and accompany Fibbon into the wide world. This required significant research and feats of magical effort from both of them, which they accomplished with aplomb. Not only were the personalities separated but the worst of the memories were left behind, leaving [[Julia]] (as she's now known) to set off with a lighter heart. With this, they convinced Elvarg to leave with them; Fibbon and Julia left through the emergency escape tunnel through the south while the adventurers and the dragon left back into the valley. The self-destruct melted the whole facility, obliterating all trace of the evil within.

== Current Personnel (circa 210 AC) ==
* [[Corran Scalebender]], Head Researcher.
* [[Fibbon]] (#11235), Facilities Director.
* [[Julia|IULIA]], Computing Core and Genius Loci. Survivor from original times.
* Elvarg, [[Dragons|dragon]]. Prisoner. Source of draconic soul fragments.
 
== Power Source ==
IR Alpha was powered by a state-of-the-art anima reactor. It consumes the condensed souls of animals or sapient beings to maintain climate, light, and research functionality throughout the facility. It consumes 1 anima brick (composed of 5 normal animal souls or 1 average sapient soul) per week, and has about 300 reserve bricks at the present time. If approached by someone with proper authorization, it can consume all its stored anima to detonate in a searing blast that would cause the surrounding rock to collapse in on the facility (destroying it utterly) while having minimal effect on the surroundings.

      <text bytes="4764" sha1="aknm64b8mfmkxp1eqc0ranfdcbfjdtz" xml:space="preserve">The elven population is a study in racial divergence. Both descended from the [[Lightborn]] via the [[Aelvar|aelvar]] common ancestor, they diverged during the [[Ages of the World|Second Age]]. High elves maintained links to the Aether-filled Astral, leading to near-immortality and strong magical capabilities. The Wood elves gave allegiance to the [[Kami|kami]], bonding with the natural elements. Changeable and wild, they gave up their long lives and innate magic for strong ties to nature and wisdom. Still able to interbreed, the two had diverged significantly by the pre-Cataclysm era.

The Cataclysm War accelerated the divergence of these people. Now, the two civilized elven populations barely consider each other as members of the same race. Wood elves consider the high elves a dead end, dying people who are stuck in the past. High elves consider Wood elves barbarous and uncivilized. Both are right. Their languages have diverged to the point that they are mutually unintelligible although they are still written in the same script.

== High Elves (Gwerin) ==
High elves are tall, slender, and graceful. Their hair, skin, and eyes take on tones that are unnatural in most other species--gold or ivory skin, metallic silver, gold, or red hair, and eyes that glitter in jewel tones. They are long-lived, reaching 120 years old on average with the eldest living to about 200 years. Their un-ageing nature died with the [[Cataclysm]], as did the strongest links to the Astral. They want those links back, desperately.

Two groups have developed, divided by how they have chosen to reclaim the past glories of their race. These factions are the [[Gardeners]] and the [[Arcanists' Union]]. The Gardeners have decided that intentional genetic modification through eugenic breeding programs is their race's best bet. They seek magics and power to breed in traits into the elven lines that will lead toward a new glorious future. Marriages are calculated and decreed by the leadership without regard for emotional compatibility. The Gardeners are more inward looking, disdaining outside influences as disruptive.

The Arcanists' Union is the smaller group, believing that a study of the magic of the past is the way forward. They are less concerned with racial purity and more with magical might. Their leaders are always powerful mages--those who reject the arcane are shunned. They tend to have very little concern for collateral damage.

High elven society (of whichever faction) is hierarchical, aristocratic, and patriarchal. Those of high blood (either genetically or magically) wield tremendous privilege and power over those of lower status. 8 Houses Major form the core of the aristocracy--5 are Gardener-allied and 3 are Arcanist. Each House Major has a stable of Houses Minor as vassals. Houses tend not be be large in size--10-20 full members on average. Women are considered somewhat lesser, but their status depends more on social class than on gender.

Since the breakup of the [[Council Lands]], the gwerin have moved almost entirely to the new [[Crisial Kingdom]]. Their queen, the time-lost [[Aelvar|aelvar]] woman known as Rānē, has managed to mute the worst of both factions and the gwerin people have entered something of a resurgence. Their population has grown tremendously recently.

With regard to other races, high elves tolerate [[Humans|humans]] (especially the [[plane-touched]] groups), pity [[Halflings|halflings]], and disdain [[Dwarves|dwarves]]. Their worst feelings are toward the [[Puun Ihmisia|wood elves]]. [[Dragonborn]] are neutral (but considered somewhat lesser like all other races). [[Hobgoblins]] and [[ophidian]]s are actively disdained; the more snobbish high elves won't associate with them or talk to them unless absolutely necessary.

Religiously, High elves venerate ancestors as well as Yogg-Magus, Tor Elan, and Aerielara (mostly). Roel-Kor has a strong following, especially among the higher classes.

Sexual propriety is a weak among the High elves. Since both male and female high elves are in conscious control of their fertility, unauthorized children are rare although marital fidelity is not a major virtue. This sexual licentiousness is a major source of inter-racial tension, especially with the dwarves.

== Naming ==
High elves are named according to the pattern &lt;Given&gt; sur &lt;House&gt;.

Common male given names include: Alwyn, Afon, Arthfael, Berwyn, Brynmor, Cadfael, Derwyn, Emris, Gerallt, Glyndwr, Idris, and Mabyn.

Common female given names include: Aelwyd, Adara, Arwydd, Blodwen, Bronwyn, Caethes, Cerwen, Enid, Gwen, Olwyn, Rhedyn, Rhian, and Saeth.

The Houses Major are: Seren, Golau, Hawal, Iledrith, Arlwyd, Tywyll, Riain, and Tuathail.

The Cataclysm War accelerated the divergence of these people. Now, many members of the two civilized elven populations barely consider each other as members of the same race. These ihmisi consider the gwerin a dead end, dying people who are stuck in the past. Conceited gwerin consider Wood elves barbarous and uncivilized. Both are right. Their languages have diverged to the point that they are mutually unintelligible although they are still written in the same script.

== Ihmisi Ethnicities ==
Ihmisi tend to be slightly shorter than humanity (standing 5'2" -- 5'10"), lithe and dexterous, with sharp features and slightly pointed (but not elongated) ears. Their hair and skin tones tend toward earth tones--browns, greens, and grays. Their hair often is mottled as if by the shadow of leaves. They live a little longer than humans, averaging 100 years. Sexiual dimorphism is non-zero but not extreme; women are slightly shorter and have sharper features, with high firm breasts. Ihmisi do not show age strongly, although their physical capabilities wane fairly normally. They are considered adult by age 20, although some prove their adulthood earlier (depending on culture) and rarely show any grey hair or wrinkles until their mid 90s. Unlike [[humans]], ihmisi exhibit very little geographically-defined physiological diversity despite being nearly as wide-spread in [[Noefra]]. Ihmisi are localized almost entirely to the [[Noefra|Noefran]] continent. A very small number exist in the [[Great Rift]] area of [[Soefra]], but they are entirely isolated there.

Ihmisi are much more fertile than [[gwerin]], with most women having between 3 and 4 children during their lifetimes (less in more settled lands). They lack the conscious fertility control of the gwerin women. Half-breeds are known, but their treatment depends on the local culture. There have been reports of interbreeding with orcish populations, creating what some have called "wood orcs" or "wild elves". But such crosses are not common or widely known.

== Ihmisi Cultures ==
Instead of physiological diversity, they exhibit more geographic cultural diversity, often related to the nature of the environment and the local [[kami]].

=== Kotimaan Culture ===
[[Kotimaa]] is the region to the north of Dreamshore and along the north coast of [[Lake Coy'in]]. It is the home to one of the two major groups of puun ihmisia in western [[Noefra]]. Socially, most Kotimaan wood elves have almost become feral. They live in tribes, wandering through the woods and wastes at the northern and eastern edges of the Council Lands. Inter-tribal squabbles are not uncommon, but the Green Lady and her court have so far prevented any serious warfare. Wood elf society is egalitarian and free--members of the tribes are free to act as long as it doesn't endanger the tribe as a whole. Tribes are led by a council formed by the chief shaman (usually female) and the warleader (usually male). Tribes choose members to act as part of the Green Lady's court--the role of Green Lady (nominal ruler of the whole race) goes to a wise woman chosen from the tribes. No tribe ever is chosen twice in a row. Power-and-status seeking behaviors are rare. They are generally allied to, but wary of, the [[Duarchy]], although many have settled down in that nation.

Sexually, Kotimaan wood elves practice exogamy--males are sent to other tribes at maturity to prevent inbreeding. Within a tribe, all children are notionally the children of the Warleader and monogamy is considered strange. Non-hetero-sexual life patterns are also not uncommon, but exclusive homosexuality is very rare.

Religiously, wood elves practice ancestor worship and venerate the spirits of the land. They tend to appease [[Lae-loara]] and [[Melara]], but cannot be said to truly worship them or any of the gods.

Wood elf tribes vary in their acceptance of outsiders. The tribes furthest to the south are the most open and "civilized," settling in fixed locations and building villages and towns. These tend to get along with most races just fine. The far tribes are much more xenophobic. Tales of sophophagy (eating of other sapient life), blood rituals, and worship of the Outcasts are common. Wood elves get along well with most races--they are wary of [[Orcs|orcs]] and dislike [[gwerin]].

Kotimaan wood elf names follow the pattern &lt;Given&gt; il &lt;Clan&gt;. Given names are androgynous.

Common given names include: Ahti, Ilmarinen, Louhi, Mielikki, Pekko, Taipo, Ukko, and Vellamo.

The notable clans in the Council Lands are Myrsky, Metsaa, Yaarvi, Pilvi, Kirjava, and Lehti.

=== Byssian Culture ===
Byssian wood elves are more civilized and settled than those from near the former [[Council Lands]]. They are most prevalent in the northern side of the country in the foothills of the Nocthian Mountains. They propitiate elemental forces and local spirits, engaging in shamanistic practices at small shrines throughout the region. They are well-integrated into the local political system, electing judges just like the human folk. See [[Byssian Culture]] for more details.

Byssian wood elves use the same names as Byssian [[Humans|humans]].

=== Auringon Culture ===
The ihmisi of [[Auringon]] (sometimes called steel elves) are very different from other ihmisi populations. The lingering effect of the [[Tale of Ages]] has reduced their lifespans to much closer to humans (80-90) and they age much more visibly. While the bulk of the ihmisi population is tribal and disdains hierarchy and agriculture, the auringon ihmisi are settled farmers and nobles and have a strong aristocratic tradition where they rule benevolently over a mostly human population. They have a very strong martial tradition, mostly involving mounted warfare in heavy armor. Also unlike most ihmisi, they tend to prefer arcane and divine magic over primal.

It was the site of the [[Cataclysm War]], as well as the original continent from which [[Oelfra]] and [[Soefra]] were split.

== Political Map ==
The image displays the political borders of Noefra as of 253 AC. Capitals are marked as black dots; white dots represent significant secondary cities (secondary capitals, for instance). Nations are named in white text; areas without overlays are populated by scattered groups without a cohesive government (usually nomadic or pastoral tribes that do not claim persistent territory). Most of the continent (other than the [[Northern Frostlands]]) are inhabited, but civilization and organized nations remain few and far between except in the central parts of the western side and the far east. The entire south-east portion, marked "Here there be dragons" is the [[Dragonreach]], which is home to various flights of [[dragons]], but they've asked me not to mark their territory. And as I do not wish to be eaten, I have complied. The far-eastern [[Zhanryu Island]] is marked with "Monsters" because truly, those are the rulers. Strange and terrible beasts found no where else, all of whom are hostile to outsiders...and each other.

There were powerful beings, but those beings were indifferent to our worship and our faith. They only responded to bargains, bargains for anima, knowledge, or other bits of Mortal life. They were angels, devils, and elemental spirits, as well as those who had transcended mortality to become one of those beings.

After the Wish, those beings scrambled to form bonds with mortals, for ''faith brings power'' not just to mortals but to the denizens of the [[astral]] plane as well. And in return, those beings, now called "gods", granted mortals a taste of their power. They gained power from the [[Great Mechanism]] in proportion to their worship (unlike modern ascended, who gain power directly from faith but do not have the connection to the mechanism). And there were many such. Hundreds upon hundreds, squabbling for influence in the [[astral]]. They ranged in power from the greater gods, worshiped across the continents, to the local deities of a village or household. And even mortals joined their ranks--the God Emperors of [[Quan Pei]] and those worshiped by the [[Imperial Cult]] among them.

==Known Old Gods==
===Categories===
* Major gods (four total) were worshiped worldwide and had very broad domains. Three of them were of the [[First Heroes]]; the last (Serak) was their mortal enemy, the sister of the [[Red Fang]].
* Intermediate (or regional) deities were worshiped by groups in particular regions and had little or no following outside that region. Some of these cross over into racial pantheons. Significant overlap in domains here, including with the major deities.
* Minor deities were generally worshiped alongside the others. Their domains were much smaller. These include those of families, village patrons, and all the more obscure ones. Many of them had little more power than a strong mortal.

      <text bytes="18517" sha1="6ckxql9c6ynb3yupkl38ggm5mt6754d" xml:space="preserve">Dragons are the descendants of one of the three original tyrant races—they descend from Wyrm, whose initial role (before the Dawn War) was to break down and recycle unneeded or improperly constructed pieces of the worlds. This they did with their mastery of True Sorcery (changing creation by renaming it). While diminished from their original power, dragons still pose a significant threat to any creature or society with which they come in conflict and have a good claim at being the most powerful individuals in the world.

== Lifecycle ==
Dragons are hatched out of eggs laid by female dragons. A breeding female will lay a dozen or so eggs, of which only a few will reach adulthood. These eggs grow after being laid as they are exposed to elemental energies, either from their environment or by their parents. A newly laid egg is about the size of a large chicken egg and is about the same color. An egg ready to hatch is much larger, about the size of a goblin and massing about 20 kg. As they mature, they take on a opalescent color, regardless of the elemental affinity of the parents or wyrmling-to-be. Eggs mature at a rate that only depends on the exposure to anima; an untended egg does not die, it merely crystallizes. A crystallized dragon egg can wait indefinitely unless physically destroyed or drained of the copious quantity of anima it contains even freshly laid.

===Hatchlings===
Eggs hatch into hatchlings about the size of a large cat, albeit one with wings, scales, and teeth. These newborns gain strength rapidly, growing over about a year’s span until they’re the size of a large dog with a 4-6’ wingspan. While hatchlings, the dragons also pick up information quickly. They’re born with the ability to speak [[Languages of Western Noefra|Draconic]], but many pick up various mortal languages by the time they become wyrmlings. During this period they retain the opalescent look of the egg and lack the fixed elemental affinity of more mature dragons.
===First Molt===
At some point after about a year (but rarely more than 2 years after hatching), the hatchlings undergo their First Molt. This is a critical time in the life of a dragon. Each hatchling is drawn to a source of elemental energy, often flying for days without stopping. Once there, they immerse themselves in the source (which ranges from an active volcano to a massive storm or icy glacier), drawing the elemental substance around themselves to form a cocoon. This cocoon lasts for a varying amount of time, usually days or weeks. Many do not survive this process (either the desperate search for a suitable source or the cocooning process). Others awaken wrong, blasted of mind and degenerated into animalistic drakes and wyverns or changed in soul despite being still of sound mind and elementally attuned (the [[drakkon]]s). Those that remain whole come out attuned to that element, their scales bearing a monochromatic palette instead of the variegated colors of hatchling-hood. They have become wyrmlings.

===Wyrmlings===
The wyrmling stage lasts for about 5 years on average (more in areas with poor sustenance and less in rich areas). While up to this point the hatchlings have no real name (frequently being called by their rank in the hatchling ranks based on rough-and-tumble brawls), they start building their identity and gain the first syllables of their name. This is where dragons are at their hungriest—without the sustenance from a hoard, they devour the flesh of creatures or even rocks. Their exact color varies—see Colors and Patterns infra. They are also at their most curious, wanting to experience everything.
===Second Molt and Juvenile Stage===
Once the wyrmling has grown to the size of a draft horse (with corresponding wingspan), they undergo the Second Molt. During this time they enter a deep sleep in a protected location. As they sleep, they mentally review their experiences, searching for their own identity in their hoard. Once they find the germ of the hoard that will sustain them for the remainder of their (very long) lives, they awaken. This process takes months to years, rarely more than 2-3 years. The young dragons that awaken are single-mindedly dedicated to starting their hoard. This is the most dangerous part of the life-cycle (for others and for the dragon)—this obsession can drive them to attack settlements, other dragons, or otherwise take risks that older dragons would be able to resist. As their hoard accumulates, they settle down.
===Adulthood===
After about a hundred years (more or less, depending on the rate of accumulation), they transition into adulthood. The Third Molt is another period of hibernation, one where they become sexually mature and transition from eating primarily physical substances to being supported by the concentrated anima of their hoards and the elemental planes themselves. This transformation takes multiple years or even up to a decade. As adults they seek out mates—some mate monogamously, others mate promiscuously. Females are in total control of their fertility and lay eggs at most every decade. By this point the dragon is very fixed in its ways and irrevocably settles on a chromatic status. This phase is the social phase, where they seek out others of their kind for challenges, cooperation, or even companionship.
===Becoming Ancient===
A very few dragons gather enough of a hoard to prompt the final transformation, the Fourth Molt into ancient dragon-hood. This process takes decades or centuries of hibernation. The creature that emerges desires control. Not enough to settle down with a hoard and occasional interactions with others, ancients want to lead a flight of their own with dragons that answer to its demands. Ancients are the most powerful of their kinds.
===Lifespan===
Whether adults or ancients, dragons live about 1500-2000 years in total, although substantial portions of that are spent in sleep (either Molt or just regular hibernation). Dragons, when they die of old age, become a form of elemental crystal that radiates strong magical power. As such, flights defend and hide their graveyards—these often serve as destinations for hatchlings (much safer than plunging into the depths of a raging volcano); conversely these are a target for marauders.

==Dragons and Hoards==
Dragons are defined by their hoards. What comprises that hoard depends on the dragon. Every dragon’s hoard is individual—some as general as “valuable items” and some as specific as “the sounds made by creatures in the depths of despair/heights of pleasure”. Some are material, others are ideas or concepts. As a general rule, the more powerful the individual dragon, the more esoteric and specific the hoard.

Elemental and chromatic affinity play some small role in this hoard formation. Metallic dragons tend to focus on more mortal-oriented (such as beautiful or ugly people or relationships or power) or arcane hoards, while chromatics tend to focus more on “classic” dragon hoards such as money, gems, artwork, or herds of animals.

Hoards are both the strength and weakness of dragons. A dragon can draw on her hoard for power, letting them go without food for decades at a stretch as well as fueling her supernatural abilities. On the other hand, if the hoard is disrupted or stolen, much of the strength is lost. In addition, dragons often become monomaniacal about their hoard, taking almost any means to extend or protect it. Threaten their hoard and they will respond, even if it’s an obvious feint. The few that can resist this intrinsic urge are the most dangerous ones around.

==Notable Dragons==
One notable set of dragons claim an entire city-state of mortals as their hoard—the city of [[Bel's Kush]] in the south-eastern [[Dragonreach]] region of [[Noefra]]. These three dragons (the gold dragon [[Vladik]], the silver known as The [[Prophet of Peace]], and the bronze [[Blazhi]]) rule the surrounding area with an iron fist, suppressing dissent and enforcing their standards of righteousness on the populace. In general, their reign is benevolent, and the standard of living has increased significantly since they took over three decades ago. They demand fidelity up a defined chain of command, with the lesser powers obeying their masters zealously and the masters protecting the lesser. Transitions between hierarchy levels is carefully controlled based on non-lethal competitions. While considered weird by other flights, they abide by the Law of the Flight and so are accepted by greater draconic society.

Another notable dragon goes by the name of [[Marcia (Dragon)|Marci]]. This adult brass dragon ostensibly claims the city of [[Kaelthia]] in the [[Council Lands]] as her hoard, but really hoards stories. She was transformed from a dragonborn into a true dragon by one of the last actions of a pre-Cataclysm deity, now forgotten to time. She lairs above the city her friends founded and watches over it in their memory, although she rarely interferes in the affairs of the city. She has a bad habit of walking among the people in human form and “requesting” that those with interesting stories visit her in her lair to share them in depth. She always pays for their time, but attendance and story time are not optional. Currently she’s watching over the rehabilitation of the mentally-damaged young dragon [[Elvarg]] rescued by some adventurers from the [[Imperial Research Alpha]] facility before its destruction. She does not participate in broader draconic society but is not outcast—she merely has never made a choice as to the Law of the Flight.

A third notable dragon is [[Gozh]]. He is an ancient dragon of uncertain color—visually he’s an albino with traces of black and metallic coloration. One of the oldest dragons on the Noefran continent, he is a powerful spell-caster who prefers humanoid shape so that he can manipulate the mortals to his will. He is a total coward who will run from physical confrontation. Currently laired in the Giant Spine mountain range, he harbors a deep and abiding grudge against dwarven-kind for the actions of a pre-Cataclysm clan. His plans to cause chaos in Fuar Uulan were disrupted by an adventuring party in 210 AC and he has retreated for the moment to figure out a new approach. He is not known to have a flight—it is theorized that he desires control over mortals because of his deviant status. To greater draconic society, he is an outcast and a pariah.

==Dragons and Names==
One constant holds about draconic names. The length of the name correlates directly with the age and experience of the dragon. Wyrmlings take a seed name of a few syllables in Draconic that describe them. To this they add more syllables in whatever language fits their fancy and that they feel describe them as they grow. Young dragons tend to have dozens of syllables in their full name; adults may number in the hundreds. Those at the end of their natural lifespan may have names that take hours to say in full.

Knowing a dragon’s name to a greater extent (even in full) does not grant any direct power over the dragon. It does describe them in detail and gives significant insight into their internal mental state, physical capabilities, and hoard. Dragons tend to use a “use name”—a few syllables chosen out of their name as a tag. All the names given here are use names, not full names.

==Colors &amp; Patterns==
Most scholars categorize dragons into 5 chromatic types and 5 metallic types. These types are each associated with an element. Unlike the default rules presentation, dragon color in Quartus is not directly correlated with power. You can have a white stronger than a red, for example. Draconic type only tells you what type of breath weapon you can expect and whether the dragon has put significant effort into the study of the arcane. Type and element do play into preferred terrain and a bit into personality, but personality is dominated by the individual, their upbringing and their hoard.

As a general rule, “chromatic” (blue, green, red, and white) dragons focus on their innate magic rather than stooping to learn the structured arcane arts. As a result, chromatics rarely cast more than simple spells and only very rarely can change their shape. Metallics (brass, bronze, copper, and silver) are the opposite—they tend to be weaker physical combatants but stronger magically. It is unknown why exposure to structured anima as a spell-caster turns the scales metallic, but this pattern is observed widely throughout dragon-kind.

Black and gold dragons are the exceptions to the chromatic/metallic duality. Attuned to the primal force of destruction itself (rather than to any element), these dragons are the closest things to the original Wyrm that still exist. Black dragons are twisted by exposure to abyssal energies, while gold dragons are suffused with radiant astral energies. This does not make blacks evil and golds good. Both are creatures of destruction and heralds of the end of things, just in different ways. It is not known how they become such, merely that they are dangerous. As exceptions, both blacks and golds can be spellcasters (or not) without showing traces of this training.

==Draconic Society==
Dragons are not highly social creatures. They are not entirely solitary, either. The default social structure for dragons is the flight—anywhere from 1 mated pair to 10-15 adults and a similar number of wyrmlings overseen by an ancient. Young dragons (after the Second Molt) are driven out (or leave on their own) to find their hoards—they may return later but usually either start their own flights or join another flight. Flights larger than a single family-unit (a mated pair and their immature wyrmlings) are usually ruled by an ancient dragon. These larger flights are not made up of related dragons—instead they’re held together by the will of that ancient and by shared values. Exceptions exist—the dragons of Bel’s Kush do not have an ancient. The three dragons there all share a hoard (an exceptionally rare circumstance) and are held together by that common tie. Solitary dragons (such as [[Gozh]]) are not uncommon.

Each flight claims as much territory as they can hold, usually about a half a day’s flight (20-25 miles) per adult in radius. Since adults don’t need as much food as younglings, they can coexist better. Chromatic dragons tend to prefer terrain away from the cities of mortals (because they aren’t fond of thieves and pointy objects and would rather not have to fight if they don’t have to); metallics often prefer to lair on the edge of mortal societies so they can play (and because most of their hoards depend on mortals). The larger flights tend to split the difference if they have mixed coloration (which some do). Only the largest flights have more than one lair-complex. Dragons of a flight all protect each other’s hoard.

Inter-flight relations are strained. In ancient times (and reaffirmed periodically at a gathering called the [[Congress of Wyrms]]) the first dragons of the 2nd Age made the Law of the Flight, which regulates the behavior of dragon with dragon. Its tenets are few, but clear.

===Law of the Flight===
* No dragon shall use mortals against other dragons. Play with mortals as you wish but using mortals as weapons against dragons will see all the flights turn against you. This includes revealing the lair of another flight.
* Hatchlings in search of their element are inviolate. Hatchling access to burial grounds must be granted without issue.
* All flights are responsible for the actions of their dragons. All must answer for the actions of the individual.
* When one dragon would enter the territory of another flight, they must request permission to hunt or to meddle with mortals in that territory.
* Disputes are to be brought to a neutral party before going to war. Meddling with the hoard of another dragon is an act of war.

Not all dragons abide by the Law of the Flight. Some (like Marci) are unaware of it; others, like [[Gozh]], consider themselves above it. This puts them outside the protections of the Congress.

The sanctions for violation of the Law are assessed by the surrounding flights—they range from exile to partial loss of hoard to (in the extreme) the destruction of the offending flight and the reallocation of the wyrmlings.

== Humans==
Known as “the devout kindred”, humans lacked the arcane power of the gwerin or the druidic might of the puun ihmisia and so were the first to turn to the gods for aid. With this divine aid they built empires that lasted for centuries, until in their hubris they turned to the arts demonic and the empires fell into civil war, the War of Souls. This war blasted the landscape with abyssal power, tainting large portions and cutting others off from the rest of the universe (blasting them out of time).

Since then, humans have adapted. Now one of the most common races, their presence is felt in most of the Federated Nations. Three major varieties of human exist in this area--they are described below.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. One score of your choice increases by 1. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Age'''. Humans become adults around age 16 and, if allowed to die of old age, tend to live around 80 years. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Size'''. This varies considerably between sub-races, but your size is Medium. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Speed'''. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Versatility'''. You gain a feat. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Languages'''. You can speak, read, and write Common. &lt;br/&gt;

===Night’s Children===
The night’s children originally lived on the high-altitude Nocthian Plateau where they were devout worshipers of Nocthis, the Goddess of Night. After the Cataclysm caused an ice volcano to erupt beneath their capital and killed their Goddess, the survivors fled south to what is now Byssia. There they mingled with the local puun ihmisia. Unique among nations, they almost uniformly reject the current Congregation of gods, preferring to venerate ancestors and spirits of nature.

Physically, night’s children are a striking race. They all have very pale skin (shades of ivory). They do not burn in the sunlight--the superstitious call it a blessing from the Nocthis. The vast majority of them have jet-black hair, usually worn pulled back or pinned up. Almost always straight and long (especially on women). Those with significant elven heritage exhibit slight mottling of greys on their hair, almost like the shadow of leaves at night. Very occasional red with black undertones. They stand tall and statuesque. Wall-builders refer to them as "living statues." The bulkiest of the human variants, they tend to develop hard curves and muscles quite well, even the women. Their eyes are slightly slanted upward and range from ice-grey to bright jewel tones (including purples and brilliant blues). At night, their eyes seem to glow slightly, like cats.

Names: Night’s children are given a name and then, later in life, a cognomen (appellation) is added at the beginning or end of the name.
Common male names include: Admitos, Damon, Adrianos, Aetos, Daphnis, Alkaios, Charklis, Herodis, Ion, Ipparchos, Savvas, and Lambros.
Common female names include: Acathi, Adriani, Danai, Daphne, Dione, Eirene, Galini, Charis, Ippodamia, Sergia, and Sotiria.

'''Ability Score Increase. '''Your Strength increases by 1'''. &lt;br /&gt;'''
'''Darkvision'''. As a gift from the dead goddess, night’s children have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of grey. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Region of Origin'''. Your region of origin is [[Byssia]]. &lt;br/&gt;

===Fang-Kin===
Fang-kin originate in the Jungle of Fangs, once the site of the Fanged Kingdom of aelvar; now the home of the Stone Throne. After magical engineering by the serpent-loving aelvar, centuries of isolation from the rest of humanity, and interbreeding with the remnants of those aelvar (to the point that none remain with even slightly pure blood), the fang-kin have diverged notably from the rest of humanity.

Physically, fang-kin have light, cool-toned skin. Patterns of colored blotches (like large freckles) are common, especially on the head, neck, and upper torso and upper arms. These often flush and darken with anger or excitement.  They exhibit wild variation in hair color, although it is most often a pure jewel or metallic tone--jet black, brilliant silver, golden yellow, ruby red and amethyst purple are the most common, but greens and blues are not uncommon. Most have multiple shades or streaks. They commonly have short, slender stature. Graceful movement is the default. Most individuals are between 5'0" and 5’5", with some variation outside this. Women are slightly shorter than men, but not tremendously. Obesity is very rare. The ideal of feminine beauty is minimal curves and slender lines. Strong fang-kin rarely develop much visible musculature. Their facial features are elongated oval facial features and their eyes are grey to green. Some change in the light or with mood.

Names: Being a hierarchical society, the naming conventions vary by class. The three major classes are nobles (including clergy), tradesmen (including soldiers), and commoners. Given names are similar between the three classes, but the structure of the name and the surnames vary. Nobles are formally named Isal &lt;Family name&gt; &lt;Given&gt;. Tradesmen are given the name Lai &lt;Profession&gt; &lt;Given&gt;. Commoners go by &lt;Given&gt; pe &lt;Location&gt;.

Given names are androgynous and include: Balin, Chea, Da, Dara, Leng, Narong, Nimol, Srey, Son, Bopha, Chanda, Khan, Maly, Map, Phalla, Ry, Rith, Thy, Thuy, and Vanna.

Noble family names include: Sat’psa, Hvang, Boeng, and Prei.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Dexterity increases by 1. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Size'''. Fang-kin are shorter than most, ranging between 5’0” and 5’5”. Their weights range toward the lower end of the scale, averaging about 110 pounds. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Ophidious Ancestry'''. You have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Regional Origin'''. Choose a region of origin from [[Asai'ka]], the [[Sha'slar Autonomous Zone]], or the [[Serpent Dominion]].

===Wall-builders===
The least ancient sub-race of humans (and the most mixed in ancestry) are the wall-builders. They call the Council Lands home. Their ancestors were refugees from many pre-Cataclysm nations, forced to flee south from the site of the Battle of Acceptance and from the massive changes in the landscape that happened at the Cataclysm. Gathering around a small settlement and a newly-founded mage school/temple, they have built a very communal, highly-ordered society. It is also the home of many other races--both kinds of elves, dwarves, halflings, and the rare infernal- and celestial-touched tieflings and aasimar. They are also the most devout of the human sub-races.

A unique trait of the wall-builders (and the source of their name) is that they cluster together wherever they build settlements and always construct at least a token wall around their villages, no matter how small. Even single houses, if possible, will have a hedge or fence or wall. They don’t feel safe without one, even if there is no threat. Another oddity due to the genetic bottle-neck of the Cataclysm is that many (but not all) wall-builders are highly allergic to bee stings. Thus, they rarely work as apiarists or tend orchards, leaving that to other races.

Physically, their skin is medium-brown and warm-toned (cafe-au-lait). Darker shades are more common than lighter ones, but neither is particularly uncommon. Their hair is dark brown to black and mostly wavy or curly. While this is the most common shade, throwbacks to other ethnicities are common and unremarkable--red hair, blond hair, etc. Only hardy individuals survived, and compactness meant less bulk to feed, so they are short and stocky in stature. They tend to stand 5'2" to 5'6" tall, with women as tall as men. Taller individuals are uncommon, with 6'0" rarely reached by anyone. Obesity is becoming more common, especially among the wealthy. The fashion in attractiveness favors the well-fed and curved. Squared-off facial features with short noses and square jaws are the norm, as are dark eyes. As with hair color, there is substantial variation to all various colors, including ones not found on Earth.

Names: Humans of the Council Lands use names following the pattern &lt;Given&gt; &lt;Profession&gt;. Children are not given surnames until they are Judged and assigned a profession.
Common male names include: John, William, James, George, Charles, Henry, Robert, and Thomas.
Common female names include: Anna, Emma, Elza, Margaret, Ida, Clara, and Alice.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Wisdom score increases by 1. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Devout'''. You gain proficiency in Religion. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Region of Origin'''. Choose your region of origin from [[Dreamshore]], [[Moon's Vengeance Foothills|Moon’s Vengeance Foothills]], [[Sea of Grass]], or [[Southshore]].
'''Skilled'''. Wall-builders all practice a craft. You gain proficiency in one artisan’s tool of your choice. &lt;br/&gt;

==Half-Elves==
Most half-elves are not truly the children of humans and elves. Instead, they are those humans with enough elven heritage that it shows markedly (or those elves with enough human heritage to be set apart from their kin). As a result, the appearance and culture of half-elves depends on which cultures they come from.

'''Speed'''. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Darkvision'''. Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim condition. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of grey. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Fey Ancestry'''. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep. &lt;br/&gt;

===Earth-kin===
Earth-kin are half-elves where the wall-builder human heritage dominates the elven side. Physically they appear to be wall-builders, although they tend to have finer features and be slightly more slender than normal wall-builders. They blend in very well, but often end up as leaders in mixed-race settings due to living in multiple worlds.

Names: Use the names indicated for wall-builders.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Wisdom and Constitution scores each increase by 1. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Extra Language'''. You can speak, read, and write Old Imperial.&lt;br/&gt;

'''Skill Versatility'''. You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice. &lt;br/&gt;

===Scaled===
Scaled half-elves are those fang-kin whose ancient elven (aelvar) heritage is noticeably dominant. They make up around 30% of the population and are considered (very) slightly higher status than those with less elven heritage, especially by the common folk. They look like fang-kin (slender, mottled “scales” on their skin, bright hair colors) except they tend to be slightly taller with more triangular features and slightly pointed ears.

Names: Use the names indicated for [[fang-kin]].

'''Ability Score Increase''': Your Charisma score increases by 2. This cannot be used to gain a racial ability score increase of +3. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Ophidian Charm'''. You can cast ''charm person'' once with this trait without providing the usual components. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast ''animal messenger'' once with this trait without providing the usual components. Your ability score for these spells is Charisma.

'''Region of Origin'''. Choose your region of origin from [[Asai'ka]], the [[Sha'slar Autonomous Zone]], or the [[Serpent Dominion]]. 

===Sharp-Ear===
Sharp-ears are a mix of gwerin (high elves) and wall-builder humans with the gwerin side dominant. They generally look like lower-class gwerin, although they tend to be slightly shorter and stockier, with darker skin and/or freckles and hair with less jewel tones. Culturally, they take after the gwerin strongly, often striving to prove themselves worthy of being accepted into one of the High Houses.

===Traveler===
Descended from puun ihmisia mixed with wall-builders (with the elven heritage dominant), travelers are misfits. Their obvious human heritage denies them the solidarity of the elven clans, but their strong elven heritage pushes them to wander and thus they feel cooped up in the walled villages of the wall-builders. Physically they are very similar to the elves they came from, although slightly stockier.

Names: Use the names indicated for wall-builders or [[puun ihmisia]].

===Twilight===

Physically they are a straight hybrid--shorter and more slender than the (tall and statuesque) night’s children but taller than the elves with the same jet-black hair and pale skin as the humans. Their ears are not noticeably pointed. Culturally, they’re exactly the same as the night’s children, although they’re accepted by the more settled elven tribes as well and often play the role of mediators between those groups.

==Dragonborn==
Created about 800 years ago by forcing fragments of draconic souls into unborn human children, dragonborn have carved out an place for themselves in the harsh terrain of the Kairen Mountains. Their culture is clan-based and warlike, as they are under constant threat from creatures of ice and winter that live on the Nocthian Plateau on the other side of the mountains. Within the last 5 years, a sizeable group of dragonborn that had been isolated in the Council Lands rejoined the remainder in the Remnant Dynasty. Divided into 6 clans (of which 5 are playable, the 6th being the royal clan and very small), each clan has specialized the training of its members. Each clan includes members of all elemental heritages (as that is an individual trait, not a family one).

Physically, dragonborn are scaled-skin humanoids standing taller than most humans (5’6” to 6’2”). They stand upright but have lizard-like tails, and their scales are different colors depending on which element their souls resonate with. While appearing reptilian, they are still mammalian, bearing live young and nursing them just like the humans they originated from. Their skins, while not as tough as the scales of dragons, are relatively insensitive and tough and so they often wear fewer clothes for incidental protection. They still wear armor as normal, with custom-made boots that leave their clawed toes free. They have hair or feather-like crests and/or horns or leathery crests.

Names: By convention, all dragonborn use names following the pattern &lt;Given&gt; &lt;Status&gt; &lt;Clan&gt;. The clans are described above, and the status marker is either ka for nobles or vo for the common folk.

Common male dragonborn names include: Aodh, Arthfael, Caderyn, Caomh, Cynbel, Cynwrig, Drustan, Judoc, Maedoc, Nechtan, and Seisyll.
Common female dragonborn names include: Abi, Ailsa, Beathag, Catrina, Beitris, Elspeth, Fiona, Iona, Isobel, Jean, Kenna, Lilias, Mhairi, Morven, Seona, Sheona, and Una.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Either your Dexterity or Strength score (your choice) increases by 2. &lt;br/&gt;
Age. Dragonborn live about the same as humans, although the rigors of their lives mean many do not die of natural causes.&lt;br/&gt;
Size. Dragonborn are taller than most humans, standing between 5’8” and 6’6” and averaging between 200 and 250 lbs. Females are slightly larger on average than males. Your size is Medium.&lt;br/&gt;
Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.&lt;br/&gt;
Draconic Ancestry. See PHB table.&lt;br/&gt;
Breath Weapon. You can use your bonus action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.&lt;br/&gt;

When you use your breath weapon, each creature must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

Creatures that fail the saving throw against your breath weapon can’t take reactions until the start of their next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee weapon attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can’t make such an attack.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Region of Origin'''. Choose your region of origin from [[Baile Duchas]], [[Byarmarsh]], or the [[Kairen Mountains]].&lt;br/&gt;

==Orcs and Half-orcs==
Orcs, like humans, are the product of aelvar meddling with hobgoblins. Cursed by blood-rage and stigmatized as savages for centuries, they fought for the Army of Darkness at the Cataclysm. In the aftermath of the Battle of Acceptance, some kept to their brutal ways; others chose a new path. About 40 years ago, a powerful shaman of the Skem tribe had a vision in which a chilling frost spread out of the Kairen Mountains and covered the land. In this vision, she saw that the only path to the preservation of her people was for them (and other tribes) to join the struggling Remnant Dynasty in their losing battle against the Hungering Frost. Four tribes (including her own Skem) accepted the call of duty.

In the following decades, the orcs of the Kard, Ko, Skem, and Tabar tribes have become a major part of Wyrmhold’s strength. The ferocity and military power of Tabar, the resource-gathering of Kard, the protection from raiders offered by Ko (as well as the artifacts recovered from pre-Cataclysm ruins), and the mystical power of Skem have given the dragonborn and goblin kingdom breathing room, leading to the current stabilization of the situation. Since the fall of the Frost, they have continued to strengthen the kingdom, although cracks are beginning to show in these peaceful times.

Not all orcs are from those tribes. Over to the east, across [[Lake Coy%27in|Lake Coy'in]], some tribes have mingled (willingly or not) with the local humans of [[Dreamshore]]. While the tribes themselves are not part of the [[Duarchy of Kotimaa]], half-breed children occasionally seek their human roots in the more settled lands. Another group of orcs in [[Godsfall]] were altered by demonic machinations--their reddened skin and enlarged tusks bear record of this alteration.

Physically, orcs are tall and bulky. They average between 5’5” and 6’6” and weigh between 180 and 240 lbs. Females are usually slightly slimmer than males, but just as tall and muscled. Their hair is usually dark brown or black and thick. Their skin has a light green-grey tint to it. They become more green when tanned. Almost all orcs have tattoos showing their clan affiliation. These start on the back of one hand (left for females, right for males) and continue up the arm. It is normal to keep that arm uncovered where possible. Their eyes are green, brown, or red. When angry, all their eyes become visibly redder.

Names: Dynastic orcs use the name pattern &lt;Given&gt; gro'&lt;Clan&gt;. Common male given names include: Aban, Dalaigh, Devlin, Dochas, Beirgin, Flynn, Gearalt, Girvan, Cian, Conlan, Cormac, Paidin, Raghnall, Raighne, Rigr, Kellach, Ruairc, Ughaire, Ualtar, Ulick, and Ungus. Common female given names include: Abaigh, Aedamnair, Agata, Daighin, Dela, Ailis, Andraste, Ebhlin, Gerricm Gitta, Gleneen, Goibne, Hayley, Ilane, Ide, Ita, Irna, Radha, Keena, Keira, Una, and Uathach.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Strength and Constitution scores each increase by 1. &lt;br/&gt;

==Fiend-Touched==
When infant or unborn humans are exposed to significant amounts of fiendish anima (either as a matter of direct heritage or, more commonly, by having a parent who contracted with a devil), they often become fiend-touched, taking on aspects of the fiend responsible. To be more precise, they take on aspects of the Territory to which the fiend belonged. Three of the five Territories are most frequently called to Quartus--the charming Mara-Deva, the brutish Chou, and the scheming Leutis.

Commonly called tieflings, the fiend-touched mostly arise in two areas--the [[Successor States]] (from Cataclysm-era intermixing with infernals summoned to aid in that desperate hour) and in the [[Jungle of Fangs]] (where devil-summoning is still practiced somewhat openly). They are more common in the [[Serpent Dominion]] than anywhere else, a legacy of the [[Devil's Rebellion]]. Fiend-touched from the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]] are mistrusted and usually given to the Church of the Seasons as infants, where they are raised as temple inquisitors and priests. Many develop sorcerous powers.

Appearance: fiend-touched are commonly marked by unnatural (to the parent human culture) skin colors (frequently red or black), eye colors and pupil shapes (red or gold slitted eyes are common), and the presence of horns or tails. This is true even if the devil to which they trace their heritage did not have such things at all. All fiend-touched have some mark that makes their nature apparent at a glance unless they take significant measures (a disguise kit or heavy cloak) to conceal it.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Charisma score increases by 1. &lt;br/&gt;'''Age'''. Tieflings age at a similar rate as humans, living slightly longer.&lt;br/&gt;'''Size'''. Tieflings are similar in size to their human parents. Your size is Medium.&lt;br/&gt;'''Speed'''. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.&lt;br/&gt;'''Darkvision'''. Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark or dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of grey.&lt;br/&gt;'''Languages'''. You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal. &lt;br/&gt;

===Chou-born===
The Territory of Chou are the most warlike of the Diabolical Territories and Families. They were summoned in large numbers as the Battle of Acceptance drew near. Their influence permanently altered a large number of bloodlines, and tieflings tied to Chou pop up from time to time in those bloodlines. This makes them the most common tieflings in the northern lands.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Strength score increases by 2.&lt;br/&gt;'''Extra Proficiency'''. You are proficient in Athletics.&lt;br/&gt;'''Hellish Resistance'''. Choose either fire or poison. You gain resistance to the damage type you chose.&lt;br/&gt;'''Devil’s Sight'''. You can see in all lighting conditions within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light.&lt;br/&gt;'''Region of Origin'''. Choose your region of origin from the [[Sha'slar Autonomous Zone]], the [[Sea of Grass]], or [[Southshore]].&lt;br/&gt;

===Mara-born===
The Territory of Mara-Deva is home to most of the succubi and incubi, as well as those devils who specialize in seduction, stealth, and trickery. Frequently summoned in the [[Jungle of Fangs]] (where one of their ranking members was responsible for the [[Devil's Rebellion]], they are not particularly war-like (although like all devils are more than capable of violence). Tieflings tied to Mara-Deva inherit unnatural charm and uncanny grace from their fiendish ancestors.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Charisma and Dexterity scores each increase by 1 (for a total of +2 Charisma). &lt;br/&gt;'''Trickster’s Charm'''. When you succeed on a saving throw against a spell or ability that would force you to act against your will (such as a charm spell or the madness effect of a gibbering mouther), roll a d20. On a roll of 10 or above, you reflect the effect back at the creature that originated it. They must make the saving throw, using the same modifiers as originally. If they fail, they are subject to the effect as if you were the caster. Once you reflect an effect in this way, you must complete a long rest before using this trait again. &lt;br/&gt;'''Extra Proficiency'''. You are proficient in Deception. &lt;br/&gt;'''Innate Spell-casting''. '''''You know the ''minor illusion'' cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the ''suggestion'' spellas a second-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so once you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the ''hypnotic pattern'' spell as a 3rd-level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.''&lt;br /&gt;'''''Region of Origin'''. Your region of origin is the [[Serpent Dominion]].''&lt;br /&gt;''

You are proficient in your choice of Arcana, History, or Nature.&lt;br/&gt;'''Innate Spell-casting'''. Choose a cantrip from any list. You know that cantrip and use Charisma as your spellcasting ability for it.&lt;br/&gt;'''Region of Origin'''. Choose your region of origin from the [[Sea of Grass]], [[Asai'ka]], or [[Southshore]].&lt;br/&gt;

==Hobgoblins==
Hobgoblins are actually simple goblins that have been infused with a portion of their tribe’s anima. Under normal conditions, tribes choose about one child out of 10 to transform. This can happen unconsciously as well. Another source is for goblins who were children when their entire tribe died to disease or warfare--the departing soul energy flows into the survivors, usually transforming them into hobgoblins or bugbears who then seek vengeance for the tribe or who carry the tribe’s memories subconsciously to another tribe. The process produces a creature that is much bigger, stronger, and more independent than individual goblins.

Hobgoblins are not directly connected to the tribal memory, but they carry a subconscious record of it at the time of their creation. While this is not directly accessible, hobgoblins often find themselves knowing things they had not experienced in person as the memories bubble up.

Socially hobgoblins contrast sharply with the majority of tribal goblins. They’re organized and focused (unlike the chaotic and unfocused tribes). They are logical rather than emotional. They’re martial as opposed to cowardly.

Appearance: Hobgoblins are slightly larger than most humans, standing 5’6"-6’0" tall and weighing between 120 and 190 pounds. Their skin has a slight orange cast to it, and they tend to go bald faster than most. Their hair tends to be dark and coarse. Their eyes are often golden. They have pronounced canines. In dim lighting they can pass for human, as long as no one looks too carefully.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Intelligence score increases by 1. &lt;br/&gt;'''Age'''. Hobgoblins age at a similar rate as humans, living slightly longer. In the wild, most elderly hobgoblins revert back to goblinhood, giving the energy invested into them back to the tribe.&lt;br/&gt;'''Size'''. Hobgoblins are similar in size to humans. Your size is Medium.&lt;br/&gt;'''Speed'''. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.&lt;br/&gt;'''Memory Fragments'''. When you make an Intelligence check to remember something, you can make the check at advantage as long as you can apply your proficiency bonus to the check.&lt;br/&gt;'''Darkvision'''. You have superior vision in dark or dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of grey.&lt;br/&gt;'''Languages'''. You can speak, read, and write Common and Ngyon Toi (goblin).&lt;br/&gt;

===Dynastic===
The hobgoblins of [[Wyrmhold]] are known for their strong technological bent and expertise with explosive weaponry.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Constitution score increases by 2.&lt;br/&gt;'''Duck and Cover'''. Being around explosives has taught you to take cover well. When you make a Dexterity saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a successful saving throw, you may roll the save at advantage. Once you do so, you cannot use this feature again until you complete a short rest.&lt;br/&gt;'''Extra Proficiency'''. You gain proficiency in alchemists’ supplies. &lt;br/&gt;

===Windwalker Collective===
The hobgoblins of the Windwalker Collective are much closer to the land and more conventionally weapon oriented. They act as tacticians for their tribal forces and so learn how to command troops.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Strength score increases by 2.&lt;br/&gt;'''Armor Training'''. You gain proficiency in medium armor and shields. &lt;br/&gt;'''Leadership'''. You can spend a bonus action on your turn to designate an ally that can both see and hear you. Before the beginning of your next turn, that ally can use their reaction to move up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Expended uses are regained when you finish a long rest. &lt;br/&gt;

'''Ability Score Increase:''' +1 Constitution

'''Age''': Dwarves age slower than humans, becoming adult around age 25 and dying of old age around 150 years old.

'''Size''': Dwarves are shorter than humans, averaging between 4'0" and 5'2" but stockier, weighing between 120 and 170 lbs. Your size is Medium.

'''Speed''': Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

'''Inexhaustible''': Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor regardless of your strength score. Additionally, your exhaustion level decreases by 1 at the end of each Short Rest and all levels are removed when you finish a long rest.

'''Languages''': You speak, read, and write Common and Bidni-Kell (dwarven).

'''Resilient''': When you make a saving throw at the end of your turn to remove an ongoing effect, you do so at advantage.

=== Surfacer ===
Surfacer dwarves are much more attuned to the trading life and inter-racial living than their deep-mountain counterparts. Tending to be taller and more slender, they are substantially more cosmopolitan. Generally the men wear elaborate beards but pull their hair back or cut it short, while the reverse is true of the women. There is moderate sexual dimorphism in body shape.

'''Ability Score Increase''': +1 Constitution and either +1 Intelligence or +1 Charisma

'''Reputation for Honesty''': You have proficiency in your choice of Deception or Persuasion.

'''Runic Charge''': You are adept with magic items. Charged magical items you possess always regain maximum charges. You can also attune or unattune to an item in 10 minutes rather than requiring a short rest. 

=== Deep-Mountain ===
Deep-mountain dwarves are arch traditionalists. They're the source of the dwarves' reputation as wonderful crafters and fierce fighters. Both men and women wear their hair short, usually pulled back into a knot, and braided beards. There is very little external dimorphism between the sexes, especially given the heavier clothing they wear.

'''Ability Score Increase''': +2 Strength

'''Darkvision''': 60 ft. 

'''Child of Stone''': As an action you can exert your native power over stone and earth. A volume of stone or earth that you touch and that fits in a 5' cube is reshaped according to your desires. If the volume contains loose earth (even mixed with small rocks), you can move it to another location within 5' of the original cube. This movement happens slowly enough that it cannot cause damage or impose any conditions. Solid stone is not moved, but you can reshape the boundaries as long as the new ones also fit into the cube. For example, you could remove or create jagged edges, widen narrow corridors to a full 5' wide or close a 5' cube of stone, smooth out marks, etc. You can use this trait to affect loose at will, but you once you use it to mold stone, you cannot use it again in that fashion until you complete a long rest. 

=== Griffonbeak ===
These wild territorial dwarves of the southern tip of the [[Jungle of Fangs]] are known for two things--they live high up in the mountains but are not underground-dwellers, and their elites ride griffons that they tame. Of all the dwarves of Western Noefra, they are the only ones whose women-folk rarely grow beards. They are short and slender and are sometimes confused for halflings...which does '''not''' make them happy. Substantial sexual dimorphism is present. They tend to wear facial and body tattoos and are known for having low standards of modesty (although still above average for the region).

'''Ability Score Increase''': +2 Dexterity

'''Additional Proficiencies''': You are proficient in Survival and Animal Handling.

'''Animal Tamer''': You can cast Animal Friendship as a ritual. You also gain the benefit of ''speak with animals'' while the charm effect is active, but only with that one creature. Once you reach 5th level, you can target monstrosities as well as beasts and the intelligence limit is removed.

=== Queen-clan ===
These are the other dwarves of the [[Stone Throne]]. Dwelling under the mountains near [[Ar Salem Dolem]], they are renowned for their staunch, almost fanatical devotion to the [[Queen Ascendant]]. They are similar to Surfacer dwarves in general look, although they tend to favor flowing clothing more.

'''Ability Score Increase''': +2 Wisdom

'''Religiously Dogmatic''': You have proficiency in Religion and Persuasion.

'''Snake-Handler''': You have resistance to poison damage and make saving throws against being poisoned at advantage.

'''Runic Smite''': When you hit a non-humanoid target with an attack, you can deal an additional 2d6 thunder damage to it. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.

      <text bytes="6298" sha1="pjnc7hm7indee889gqh8qdpbmbh5h16" xml:space="preserve">In the [[Prehistory|beginning]], the Dreamer created the 8 + 1 Primordials to aid him in the construction of a world in the Dreaming Dark. To serve them in their tasks It created the Progenitor Races, numbering six. This is the story of the Lightbound, those who served Light (Law, Progress) before the Dawn War.

== Lightbound, Angels, and Devils ==
At the conclusion of the Dawn War, the Lightbound had been nearly destroyed as they had served in the front lines of that great war. A small fraction decided to stay in the newly-formed [[Astral]] Plane and became the [[Angels|angels]]. They refused change and so are some of the few true immortals--when one is slain in combat its Spark reforms in the Celestial City. Most of the personality remains, but the capabilities are changed by this transition. Angels are completely devoted to their assigned tasks--they show little personality or individuality while among other peoples. There are several orders of angels (in descending order of strength): solars, planetars, Astral deva, and valorites.

Others stayed in the [[Astral]] but did not devote themselves to duty as did the angels. These became the [[Infernals]] (also known as devils). They vastly out-number the angels, but don't draw power from the [[Great Mechanism]] directly. Instead they draw sustenance from contracts--with gods, angels, elementals, or even mortals. They are the main interface point with the [[Mortal]] plane.

== Fallen Lightbound ==
The majority of the lightbound settled on the mortal plane where they were much reduced in power. They attempted to live in peace as much as possible, but were quickly conquered by the Titans and molded into overseers and slave-masters for the earth-bound Tyrants. Within a few thousand years, they had lost their former desires for peace and had become the race known as aelvs. A tiny group of deva rebelled and took up residence on the mortal plane a few thousand years after the Dawn War and thus were denied rebirth in the Celestial City. These planebound deva found themselves reborn time after time into mortal bodies, remembering only fragments of their past lives. It is believed that at the Cataclysm they were granted pardon and reborn onto the Astral plane (and thus are extinct on the mortal plane). 

== Cysgoroesi ==
A few of the lightbound who settled in the mortal plane, seeing their fellows being conquered by the Titans, begged admittance en masse into the Astral Plane. It was too late for that--they had already become mortal. However, the powers that were took mercy on them and changed them, granting them freer access across Shadow to the various planes than most mortals as well as the ability to live among the planes. They have settled primarily in Shadow, building library-fortresses and archives in that bleak place. From here they send agents throughout the planes in search of knowledge of all types. They are observers and collectors by nature, gathering interesting things, memories, and people (sometimes unwillingly) and preserving them. It is said that anyone who is willing to brave the dangers and the unpredictable nature of the shadow realm (and its denizens) can enter the libraries and ask a single question, receiving a truthful answer. The cost? A portion of their memory, or sometimes their life (depending on the question and its answer). These are the [[Cysgoroesi|cysgoroesi]], the shadow elves. 

== Aelvs and Puun Ihmisia ==
The oldest race to survive into recorded history, the aelves discovered wizardry and were the dominant race of the 2nd Age. Nearly ageless but still very mortal, they prized the arcane so much that they exiled children born without the knack for wizardry. These exiles consciously shed any remaining connection to the Light and the Astral plane, taking up the propitiation of primal spirits and becoming the modern puun ihmisia (nicknamed wood elves). The Second Wish caused the utter destruction of the dominant aelven empire (the Roelwr), leaving broken remnants to assimilate with humans and other races. One group of aelves, inhabiting what became Soefra, retained power and reformed the empire.

=== Gwerin ===
At the Cataclysm, the remaining aelves found their agelessness taken from them. Modern gwerin (high elves) are all too conscious of their short (by comparison) lives and have a strong desire to regain the glories of the past.

=== Goroesi ===
One other branch of aelvs was separated from the ruling Roelwr before the Second Wish besides the puun ihmisia. These were the goroesi--demi-nobles known for their power of sorcery (rather than the high wizardry of the roelwr). Molded by imperial magics into overseers for the slave races (and the outcast puun ihmisia), they were given unique features to distinguish them from the common herd. Skin black as night, hair like spun silver, eyes in jewel tones. These are the marks of the Goroesi, called "dark elves".

Being warned by the first druids of impending Moonsfall (after the Second Wish), they took refuge as a race in Shadow, where they lived for a generation. On their return, they founded cities in the ruins of Moon's Vengeance, where they have stayed for time out of mind. They still bear the mark of Shadow even after many thousands of years--the light of day is distressing to their eyes. As a result, they live in caves and underground cities. Only recently have they made their presence known outside their hidden strongholds. Even after all this time they bear a grudge against the gwerin as decedents of their former masters.

=== Tymoroesi ===
Some elves (usually puun ihmisia by parentage) come under fae influence before birth. Sometimes this is due to a dalliance (knowing or otherwise) between a fae and an elf, sometimes it's simply due to a strong fae or kami presence during conception. Either way, the child is born a bit touched by these alien, mutable beings. These are considered special children, and often become shamans or leaders among the tribes. They don't breed true often, and so are rare. They are most common in [[Byssia]] (where connections to the fae and the kami are more openly acknowledged and encouraged) but are not unknown in the Council Lands. The common name for the fae-touched elves is "eladrin," meaning roughly "people of flowing-water."</text>

      <text bytes="15837" sha1="joybu7ce219hseij2r5vacksnlitf7p" xml:space="preserve">[[Prehistory]] covered the time from the creation of the world to the end of the Dawn War, about 25,000 years before the [[Cataclysm]] (BC). This article covers the time between the end of the Dawn War and the present. All times until the 3rd Age are approximate.

== The Fallow Time (~25k BC) ==
For the first few thousand years, Quartus was quiet. The ancestors of the current races struggled with the loss of most of their power and numbers. As time went on, two races rose to power, creating civilizations and enslaving (or ignoring) the other races cowering around their crude huts and fires. These two were the Titans and Wyrm.

=== Titans ===
The Titans are covered in [[Titans]]. In short, they were Order-aspected humanoids, covered in runes and wielding runic power. There were also Lesser Titans, those about the size of a human who dug and tunneled and built for their larger brethren. Claiming to be "uplifting" the lesser races, they enslaved them with runes and forced them to do tasks that the Greater Titans were ill-suited for or unwilling to sully themselves with, like farming.

Note: In light of recent discoveries, this description may not be entirely true.

=== Wyrm ===
Wyrm is the name given to all the scaled folk, the ancestors of current dragons. Elemental in nature, they wielded raw sorcery in the spoken word and their will imposed their power onto reality. Unlike the Titans, they were more solitary and individually powerful. They tended to be worshiped as gods by the lesser races, demanding tribute.

=== Lesser Races ===
The other land-bound races (the [[Lightborn]] and the [[Proteans]]) were unable to compete with the larger races. Lacking power to match either the runes or elemental sorcery, they were enslaved and crushed underfoot.

== The 1st Age--The Tyrants at War (~20k BC) ==
The war was inevitable from the first meeting of the Tyrant races. Neither would budge or give place for the other; their habits of life were incompatible. For nearly ten thousand years this war raged--titans destroyed wyrm, wyrm obliterated titan. And the lesser races (including the Lesser Titans) suffered.
=== Important Events===
; First Titan-Wyrm War (~20k BC) : The event that most scholars accept as the start of the Age of Tyrants. No one knows who started it or when, but the titans lost. Badly.
; Proteans become goblinoids (~15k BC) : Under titan influence, the worst of the effects of their curse were softened and the three-fold race came to be.
; Lightborn become aelvar, [[cysgoroesi]] split off  (~14k BC) : Those of the [[lightborn]] who remained on the Mortal were shaped by the titans into overseers, ruling over the goblinoids in service of the distant masters. Escaping and finding shelter in [[Shadow]], the [[cysgoroesi]] date from this era as a people.
; Dawn of bardic magic (between 14k BC and 10k BC) : Leviathan teaches mortals to sing the Words of Creation.
; Second Titan-Wyrm War (~12k BC - 10k BC) : Records from an ancient titan stronghold depict this war as a multi-thousand-year stalemate with occasional flashes of violence. Definitely started by the [[Titan Conclave|Conclave]]; not all titans were involved. Nor were all wyrm.
; Creation of the [[Orb of All Might]] and beginning of the dwarves (10654 BC) : In an effort to win the war, the [[Titan Conclave|Conclave]], led by [[Isskap]] and manipulated by [[Broken Order]], created the [[Orb of All Might]]. It was empowered by draining the runic essence from the legions of "lesser" titans (roughly half the population), diminishing them into the ancestors of the modern dwarves.
; Last Titan-Wyrm War (~10k BC) : The [[Titan Conclave|Conclave]] activated the [[Orb of All Might]], intending to enslave wyrm forever. As predicted by [[Perkunos]] and [[Tatsuryuu]], it backfired and shattered. The [[Titan Conclave|Conclave]] enters stasis and is corrupted by [[Isskap]], who remains free and flees to the elemental plane of Water. The abortion of a war ends when the remaining titan and wyrm join forces to create the [[Titanwall|Titanwalls]] and use the [[Eyes of Qa'desh]] to split off the continent of [[Oelfra]] from the primal mega-continent. A few titans and wyrm, now [[jazuu]] and [[dragons]], remain on the eastern continent.

=== Aelvar ===
Scions of the [[Lightborn|lightborn]], descended from the servants of the Primordial of Light, the aelvar maintained their grace and connection to the Astral plane. Long-lived and intelligent, they were the overseers and palace servants to the Titans. They chafed under this rune-bound fist--why should the sons of Earth rule over the sons and daughters of Light?

=== Proteans ===
Twisted and cursed, the proteans were the servants of Change, locked into the Material Plane by decree of the Dreamer. They retained some of the mutability of their past, but their intellect was reduced to slightly above that of animals. They formed the brute labor of the Titan empire. Did they dream of freedom? Who knows.

== The 2nd Age--The Age of Wizardry (~10k BC) ==
The Tyrants' War came to an abrupt end with the First Wish. A nameless aelvar used the power of the Cosmic Forge, locked in the Eternal Library, to write "Sound and shape combine to upset the tyrant's power." Runic power (power in shape and writing) and sorcery (spoken words of power) were merged and reshaped to be accessible to mortals--this combined power is the basis of wizardry.

With this wish and the fall of the Tyrants, the aelvar took the reigns of civilization. They built empires, tamed the wilderness, and enslaved all the lesser races that they could. Theirs was an empire built on wizardry--any aelvar who could not wield the arcane power was stripped of rank and title and banished into the wilderness. By 8,000 BC these outcasts had rejected the tie to the Astral Plane and had begun searching for a power that could match the arcane power of aelvar wizardry, taking the name of Wood Elves. That search took four thousand years.

===Important Events===
; First Wish (~9500 BC) : After the cracking of the continent, the First Wish brings power back to mortals in the form of wizardry.
; Aelvar empires formed (~9k BC) : The aelvar dominate the goblinoids and dwarves throughout the eastern continent. Dwarves mostly retreat into the mountains but pay token tribute to the empires.
; [[Goroesi]] created (~6500 BC) : Just as the titans molded the lightborn into the aelvar to serve as overseers, the aelvar wizard-lords molded some of their "lesser" kin (those who could not wield the full fires of arcana) into overseers and artisans. Giving them dark skin to set them apart, they formed the [[goroesi]].
; [[Puun Ihmisia]] first noted as separate people (~5k BC) : Those aelvar who completely lacked the talent for arcana (or who rejected arcane power) were driven to the fringes of the empire and treated as worse than the goblinoids. They banded together and changed over time, becoming the ancestors of the modern [[Puun Ihmisia|ihmisi]].

== The 1st Interregnum--Dawn of Primal Power (~4k BC) ==
The interval after Moon's Fall and before the Third Wish is known as the First Interregnum by scholars.
===Important Events===
; Second Wish (~4k BC) and Moon's Fall : The [[Puun Ihmisia|ihmisi]] turned to the natural spirits that pervade the landscape, the spirits of rock and tree, of river and storm, of animals and forest fires. Forging an understanding with these spirits was a long and arduous process, with limited success. The thoughts and desires of the primal spirits were simply too alien to those of the elves. Then came the breakthrough. Remembering the First Wish, a band of wood elves slipped into the Eternal Library through the city that encircled it. The guards were lax--after all, what could those powerless fools do? The aelvar in their hubris had forgotten that the Cosmic Forge did not require wizardry--merely a soul willing to sacrifice everything to cause change.

That band gave their own souls to make the Second Wish--"The spirits of all things heed our call and will strike bargains." The nascent druids quickly forged pacts with the greatest spirit they could find--the Third Moon. They brought that ill-omened sphere down on the center of aelvar power, creating the circular ring of mountains and craters that still exists in south-central Noefra. Evidence uncovered in 212 AC points to [[awakener]] influence in this decision, which explains how they were able to command the moon. Shards of that moon still dot the landscape, mostly north and east.
; Disappearance of the [[Goroesi]] (at Moon's Fall) : The [[goroesi]], whose major population centers were in and around the aelvar capital, disappear from history at this point.
; Second Sundering (~4k BC) : After Moon's Fall, the largest group of survivors of the aelvar empire used the [[Eyes of Qa'desh]] to split off [[Soefra]] from the continent now known as [[Noefra]].
; Creation of humans and orcs (~3500 BC) : Meddling by both remaining groups of elves created two races from hobgoblin stock--[[humans]] and [[orcs]]. Born to be soldiers, pawns in the endless fighting between those bitter enemies, they quickly grew to outnumber their masters.
; [[War of Blood]] (2550 BC) : The being known as the [[Red Fang]], once an orc, now hosting a demon, led forces (mainly orcs, but of all races) in an expansionary war of terror and bloodshed starting from central [[Noefra]]. The remaining peoples banded together, but were pushed to the coasts.

== The 3rd Age--The Age of Gods and Men (2504 BC) ==
Only fragmentary written evidence exists of the time before the end of the 1st Interregnum. The 3rd Age marks the dawn of comprehensive written history.

=== Important Events===
; Third Wish and the end to the [[War of Blood]] (2504 BC) : After nearly 50 years of this reign of terror, the [[First Heroes]] arose. Fighting through occupied territory to the Great Library, the Forgotten One raised the Cosmic Forge and uttered the Third Wish: "Faith brings power". With that, mankind unlocked the connection with the divine. The newly-arisen gods, once merely ascended spirits, devils, and elemental forces, claimed their clerics, including the remainder of the Heroes. Those heroes struck at the [[Red Fang]], managing to seal him away in the [[abyss]] and bring the [[War of Blood]] to an end.
; Foundation of [[Godsfall|Divina Lux]] (2480 BC) : The only surviving Hero, [[Aerlan Godspeaker]], founded a city dedicated to the gods and their worship.
; The [[God Wars]] (2435-2103 BC) : AKA the Wars of Unification. Basically a big mess as people scrambled for power.
; Unification Treaty, Twin Empires (1 Spring Dawning, 2103 BC) : The two powers that coalesced out of the [[God Wars]], one in the east and one in the west, forged a peace treaty to end the wars. Thus were born [[Tibor Imperia]] and [[Quan Pei]], the Western and Eastern empires.
; Western Golden Age (1203 BC - 997 BC) : Under the Biblia dynasty, [[Tibor Imperia]] experiences an age of rapid progress in magic and technology surpassing that of the aelvar empire (although structured along different lines). This ends when the last Biblia emperor is assassinated by greedy nobles.
; Rot sets in (997-807 BC) : Under the Aurum dynasty, research into previously-forbidden soul technology ramps up and the empire decays. Weak emperors, demonic influence, and complacency.
; Creation of the dragonborn (840 BC - 800 BC) : Under Grand Sapentium Iorda, the [[dragonborn]] race is created by fusing draconic souls into unborn children conceived in rape.
; [[War of Souls]] (801 BC - 599 BC) : After the unveiling of the [[dragonborn]], the few remaining traditional provinces rebelled. A terrorist group sacrificed themselves to detonate a [[concept bomb]] in the imperial capital, destroying it utterly. Civil war takes over. [[Concept bombs]] and other taboo weaponry are used liberally. By the end of it, there is no more empire and the technology gained during that golden age is in ruins.
; First reported halfling sighting (648 BC) : Born out of the twisting energies unleashed during the [[War of Souls]], the halflings got their start in central [[Noefra]] at this time.  

== The 2nd Interregnum and The Cataclysm War (600 BC - 205 AC) ==
The period after the [[War of Souls]] but before the Fourth Wish is known as the Second Interregnum.
=== Important Events ===
; Formation of the western successor kingdoms (559 BC): A peace treaty formed five major nations and a host of smaller ones: the [[Kingdom of the Plains]] (covering the modern [[Sea of Grass]]), the [[Flower Kingdom]] (whose lands now lie under the [[Sea of Dreams]]), [[Nocthia]] (occupying most of the [[Nocthian Caldera]], with the rest occupied by [[Old Wyrmhold]]), [[Imperial Meztli]] (covering the western edge of the continent), and the [[Fanged Kingdom]] (who were a semi-independent vassal state under [[Tibor Imperia]]).
; Departure of the lords of the [[Fanged Kingdom]] and formation of the [[Stone Throne]] (303 BC) : The gwerin masters abruptly vanished, seeking godhood. They left behind the [[Queen Ascendant]] and their servitor peoples.
; Destruction of [[Bolor Hold]] (48 BC) : Betrayed by other dwarven clans, one of the main clans of the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] was destroyed by raiders. The survivors were scattered.
; [[Cataclysm War]] begins (1 BC): As is well known, the [[Nameless]] was liberated from his abyssal prison by a sorcerer who had locked himself away from the [[War of Souls]] in a time-warped bubble. Raising an army of monsters (including orcs, giants, and goblins, as well as undead, fiends, and demons and evil-hearted humans and others), this conjoined Evil swept across the land and the armies of Order were hard-pressed. As a last ditch effort, they sent teams of adventurers after every powerful artifact known to the Eternal Library. One team succeeded, but instead of bringing the [[Eyes of Qa'desh|Left Eye of Qa'desh]] back to the Army of Order, they used it themselves. Their wish was not recorded, but the after-effects were evident to everyone. The Eye exploded, consuming all free anima (and all life) within several hundred miles. In the after-shock, magic failed and the Great Mechanism teetered on the edge of ruin. The gods used the [[Fangs of Resolution]] and the [[Cosmic Forge]] to sacrifice themselves to a two-fold purpose: First, maintain the mechanism. The Four (gods of the Empire) were chosen to fuse with the Mechanism to give it direction and all available anima went into maintaining and supporting the planes, rebuilding them into the current order. Incorporate the Nameless into the planes as Free Will--the ability of all races to choose their path

As a result, no magical power functioned--not primal (the spirits were hiding and broken), not arcane (the anima patterns were disrupted), nor divine (no gods existed to hear the call of faith). This state of affairs lasted for 50 years, during which 80% of all intelligent life perished (either in the cataclysmic upheavals attendant to the Eye's destruction or of hunger and wild beasts) and the races retreated behind the highest walls they could find.
== The Fourth Age==
Starting around 200 AC, the world broke out of its fear and began to open up. It is currently the year 250 AC by western reckoning, and it is a time of growth, exploration, conflict, and hope.
===Important Events===
; The [[Catalysts]] and the founding of the [[Federated Nations]] (205 AC) : See [[Catalysts]]
; Liberation of [[Godsfall]] (210-212 AC) : See [[Liberation of Godsfall (Campaign)]].
; End of the [[Hungering Frost]], rediscovery of the [[Abandoned Clans]], and end of [[Isskap]] (212 AC) : See [[Airship Pioneers]] and [[Wild Cards]].
; Rediscovery of [[Soefra]] : See [[Southern Heroes]].

They do not interact with the mortal plane much, and when they do, the results are usually not pretty. Appearing as androgynous bird-winged figures ranging from human height to 10 feet tall, their faces are always masked with eyeless white masks adorned with symbols of their rank and station; their weapons burn with astral fire.

The angelic hosts are those who chose to swear devotion to [[Great Mechanism]] back at the end of the Dawn War. Ever since, they have drawn power from it as they carry out their roles. When they fall in battle, their sparks are reborn into new astral bodies. Only the Fallen are lost forever, replaced by devils that choose to enlist. Some of the Solars have been around since the Dawn War itself--the High Wing-Leader of the First Host is reportedly still on his first body. The Fallen Deva, who were left behind on the [[Mortal]] plane have rejoined the ranks of the Hosts since the [[Cataclysm]], bringing that division to an end.

== Types of Angels ==
There are several ranks of angels, each possessing certain powers and capabilities and duties. They are (in descending order of strength):

;Solars: There are only 24 of these in existence and their power is unmatched by any except a demon prince.
;Planetar: The leaders and heavy combat troops of the Hosts. They exist to fight, to die, and to be reborn to fight some more.
;Deva: The elite mobile infantry of the Hosts, as well as the spies, messengers, and scouts.
;Seraphim: Combat healers and spell-casters, these stay at range and support the others.
;Imagineers: The only fully non-combatant angels (although in a pinch they can defend themselves quite well). Researchers, logistics specialists, and crafters. They produce and maintain the weaponry and supply lines of the Hosts.
;Valorites: The line infantry of the Hosts.

== Hosts and Legions ==
There are 16 Legions, divided by role into 4 Hosts. They are as follows, along with their assigned duties. In total, there are 2^12 (4096) angels, 2^8 (256) per legion.

=== First Host--Headquarters and Logistics ===
Stationed in the Celestial City itself, they form the last line of defense for the Great Mechanism as well as the command and supply corps for the Hosts.

The legions of the First Host are:

;First Legion: Elite command troops.
Led by the High Wing-leader himself, with two other solars, 53 planetar, and 200 deva.
Duties include policing the Astral Plane as well as coordination of other legions.
;Second Legion: Spies and messengers.
1 solar, 5 planetar, and 250 deva.
Duties are to carry commands to the other legions and to be the eyes and ears of the High Wing-leader.
;Third Legion: Research
1 solar, 255 others of unknown role. Probably many Imagineers.
Extremely secretive. Engaged in research into weapons, tactics, enemies, etc. Feared by the common astral denizens.
;Fourth Legion: Logistics
1 solar, 255 imagineers
This legion handles all logistics and supply for the Hosts, including production and maintenance. They employ many devils.

===Second Host--Protecting the Outer Boundaries===
This is the cream of the crop. They sit on the outer boundaries of Quartus, slaying any threats that enter through the Border Beyond. If they ever interact with mortals, they have absolutely no pity or compromise. Hardened by eternal war, they are the boogeymen of legend for the inhabitants of the planes. The legions are:

;First Legion: Command and Mobile Reserve. 2 Solars, 118 planetar, 116 deva, 20 seraphim.
;Second Legion: The Hammer. 2 solars, 204 planetar, 50 seraphim. Offensively-oriented. Even less sense of collateral damage than usual.
;Third Legion: The Anvil. 1 solar, 155 planetar, 100 seraphim. The defensive counterparts to the Hammer.
;Fourth Legion: The Seeking Eye. 1 solar, 250 deva, 5 seraphim. Scouts, these angels work in small bands instead of phalanxes. Of all the 2nd host, these are the most mortal friendly.

===Third Host--Policing the Elemental Planes===
These are the lesser-regarded legions, stationed across each of the elemental planes to enforce the will of the Four on the fractious inhabitants and to handle problems involving inter-planar travelers. They're much more mortal-friendly and relaxed than the first or second host. The legions are:

;First Legion: Guardians of Fire. 2 solars, 50 planetar, 180 valorites, 20 seraphim, 4 imagineers. The Fire plane is one of the rougher planes and these angels play the role of bouncer and enforcer quite frequently. Very no-nonsense.
;Second Legion: Guardians of Water. 2 solars, 50 planetar, 100 valorites, 80 deva, 20 seraphim, 4 imagineers. The endless seas of the plane of Water hide many secrets. The second legion is constantly on watch for strange occurrences.
;Third Legion: Guardians of Air. 1 solar, 54 deva, 100 valorites, 100 seraphim. Often used as a R&amp;R haven for those recovering from injuries, this is primarily a medical legion. There are few threats here.
;Fourth Legion: Guardians of Earth. 1 solar, 54 planetar, 180 valorites, 20 seraphim. The most ordered and boring post of all the Legions, the Plane of Earth rarely requires much oversight.

===Fourth Host--Reserve and Training===
This host is only called to active duty under the most extreme circumstances (the last such occurrence was the Cataclysm War). It consists of the following legions:

;First Legion: Retired Reserve. 6 solars, 250 others. These angels have been wounded so severely that they are unfit for further direct combat on the line. They spend time here recuperating and training the other legions. Injured they may be, but weak they are decidedly not. They split their time between the outskirts of the astral plane and the plane of air.
;Second, Third, and Fourth Legions: Trainees. Newly reborn angels require time to acquaint themselves with their new bodies (especially if they were posthumously promoted). Newly sworn angels (rare as that may be) also require significant training. The numbers and compositions of these legions vary.

      <text bytes="5601" sha1="d94r5xf4pszeyiz44p3obpkuc2wavlg" xml:space="preserve">Translator's note: Common is not English, nor is druidic Japanese. But these were the closest concepts I could find. I apologize for any infelicity of meaning.

----Begin record----

Editor's note: This is a fragment of a lesson delivered to novice druid candidates at the [[Dreamgrove]] in central [[Byssia]]. Although delivered in druidic, I have translated it into Common. The word "kami" has been left, as the Common words "spirit" or "god" or "supernatural" have the wrong connotations. Shindai and genki are technical terms also left in the original.

Everything that can grow or develop or change must have an associated Spark, the thing that changes but remains the same. In the races of man, we call that Spark the soul. Well, the forces of nature, the plants, the animals, the wildfires, the storms, all these and more have a Spark as well. To distinguish these Sparks from the mortal soul, we will call them kami.

Kami come in two basic states, between which they can transition (consciously or not). Shindai (asleep) or genki (awake, lively, healthy). Shindai-kami can only be changed by outside forces, they cannot change themselves. Genki-kami can grow and change on their own, like plants or animals in their natural state. A hunk of metal ore, torn from the ground by miners and hammered, can only be shindai. Mourn for the spirit, now stifled in silence if it exists at all. This is why we, those who hear the voices of the kami, will not willingly surround ourselves with suits of beaten metal. We accept that it must be, but to surround ourselves with the silent voices of the sleepers is too much. Too much pain to bear. 

It is a fact of the Dream that kami are not separate entities, unlike souls. The mountain is one kami, but so are each of the boulders, yet they are both separate and not separate kami. When the mountain must move, the kami are one. When the boulders must move, they are separate, but still united. The kami of the wolf-pack is one, but each wolf is both the kami of the pack and the kami of the individual beast. So it is with all. This paradox of unity and division lies at the root of the seemingly irrational mentality of the kami. They understand death and birth (how could they not--birth and death are part of the cycle of change), but they don't understand individuality and loss, except dimly. If you disperse a spirit entity without destroying the physical entity to which it is bound, it will reform some time later unharmed. Dispersion is a minor consequence, like losing a childhood game. More serious is the corruption of nature--forcing things to go against their inherent natures. This the kami hates. Undeath too, the kami hates, for it tugs and nibbles at the net of kami itself, leaving only void in its wake.

Kami remember anything that happened to them, or any that they have merged with. But the meaning they take from it is not what we take, because their senses are not the same as ours. What they remember most clearly, and what affects them most, is the emotion with which the acts were performed. Only those kami who inhabit the bodies of animals even understand human emotion at all, and theirs is a muted, altered experience. I used the word "hate" above--a better term would be "is opposed to, acts against." So acts endowed with strong emotion fascinate the kami. In places or situations full of strong emotions, the local kami gather, merging into more complex forms that take physical shape that mimics those of mortals. These are the [[fey]]. They flit about the edges of mortal society, studying, mimicking, and inciting emotion. The fey are not eternal--many are transitory, existing for a moment and then dissolving back into their constituent kami. But some, especially those that become addicted to emotion, are longer lived.

The fey wear emotions like masks--the emotion they are portraying determines their shape and their behavior. They are not inherently malicious (although some act in ways indistinguishable from malice), but that does not make them harmless. To the fey (like to all kami), individual death is meaningless, but grief and pain are emotions to be toyed with just like joy or pleasure.

Some talk about [[fey courts|courts of the fey]]--this is both true and false. There are two[1] main polarities of fey--those that are portraying the "positive" emotions and those that are portraying the "negative" emotions. Both these terms are misleading--a fey's portrayal of joy may be strange, almost manic, while a fey's portrayal of sadness may be beauty itself. For they do not understand the emotions that they portray. They experiment with combinations, with experiences, jumbling them together like a kaleidoscope. Fey also change from one polarity (or Court) to another seemingly randomly--sometimes prompted by events of emotional salience near them, other times on a whim. There are no rulers, although the fey will crown one of their number "king" or "queen" (the title is at a whim, fey are neither male nor female) in mimicry of human traditions. The only thing that binds them is their kami nature--they are tied to their areas and cannot willingly go against their natures. They also will only cause lasting harm to another kami's territory under extreme duress, although mortals are fair game.

Beware of the kami associated with concepts, for those are the strangest of all. I will speak more of those later, after your initiation is complete.

----End record----

[1] Says him. Others count four "courts", although they're more like ''categories'' than real nations.

      <text bytes="3712" sha1="sgxh6g8lhitgapufz1hnqr6jjdcg49h" xml:space="preserve">Some beings that ascended to power in the aftermath of the Cataclysm were unable or unwilling to abide by the strictures of the Four. These were ejected from the Astral plane and took up residence in the (now-deserted) Abyss, shaping the chaotic darkness to their own liking. Each of these beings gains power from sources outside of the Great Mechanism. These sources are usually unpleasant and include blood sacrifice, betrayal, corruption, and torture. They offer their mortal followers power, but betray them at their own convenience. Membership in the Outcast Cults is forbidden in the [[Federated Nations]] and carries an immediate death penalty.

The five major Demon Princes are:

==Lloitira, the Lady of Pain==
[[Lloitira]] is a beautiful but twisted creature who delights in torture, pain, and sexual perversion (including necrophilia, rape, and other such evils). She also delights in the corruption of the self-righteous and the destruction of social order. Her cult is especially active among the high-ranking members of society including rich merchants. It offers free indulgence in perversion and other darker urges. The symbol of the Pain Cult is a barbed-wire ring. Pain cultists strongly oppose the followers of the Red Fang.

==The Twisted==
This being, in shape much like a kraken, was one of the four eldest children of the [[Echidra]], the so-called Mother of Monsters. In the aftermath of the [[Dawn War]], it turned on its brethren and mother and was instrumental in getting them imprisoned. Over the ages that followed, it served [[Leviathan]], while also acting towards its own perverted ends. It daemonized after its deceptions were discovered near the end of the Interregnum, becoming the demon prince of corruption. It is the patron of all things distorted and mutated, of abominations, of disease. Its motivations are obscure and incomprehensible. The Twisted Cult has no central organization or symbol. It exists in cells of 3-8 members--cells do not know other cells. These cells grow in power by corrupting the land and living things and spreading disease. Eventually, they collapse (whether destroyed from the outside or the inside varies).

==Oro-laen, Black Lord==
Proud and formal, [[Oro-laen]] is the most intellectual and the most approachable (for mortals) of the Outcast. He even keeps his promises; those contracting with him are advised to carefully review the contract before signing. He is interested in the dark side of magic--necromancy, undeath (especially free-willed undeath), black magic, blood sacrifice, etc. He emphasizes knowledge as a source of power over others. His cult (under the symbol of a white skull) recruits from the magically active (especially warlocks and sorcerers) and practices ritual magic including blood sacrifices and necromancy. The Granite-Flame Academy has been heavily infiltrated by the Black Cult.

==The Red Fang==
Bestial and brutal, the [[Red Fang]] is the patron of slaughter, savagery, and blood-lust. Most were-creatures and other shape-shifters pay at least token homage to the Fang, as do spree-killers and berserkers who glory in blood. Its cult is most active among the less civilized tribes (especially orcs). It urges its followers to rend, kill and devour. Its plots are direct and usually extremely violent.

==Seleleana, The Jester==
This being was too insane and random even for Pinwheel. Any semblance of coherence or direction is abhorrent to it. It plots against everything and everyone, itself included. It glories in insanity, malicious tricks, false prophecies, and other deceptions. Its cult appears to act randomly. Some observers are worried that this appearance of randomness is actually a cunning facade.</text>

      <text bytes="8191" sha1="3ayp9qar3zwjgsvggrzylni4nlynpsj" xml:space="preserve">Designed as an eternal prison for the [[Nameless]] and its core minions at the end of the [[Dawn War]], the Abyss is cut off from the direct influence of the [[Great Mechanism]]. With the events of the [[Cataclysm]] and the freeing of the Nameless and its minions (and its incorporation into reality), the Abyss is no longer a tightly guarded prison or a cyst in reality, but a haven for those who have made themselves unwelcome elsewhere. Without the circulation of anima from the Great Mechanism, abyssal denizens rely on other, less salutatory sources of power. Mostly, they consume souls. Some are willingly bargained away, others are sacrificed in blood-magic rituals.

==Demenses and Habitations==
Originally a light-less void where space, direction, and motion meant nothing, the new Abyss has been transformed by the Demon Princes and their followers. Landscapes and buildings were carved out of the void, created by force of will and buttressed with anima from mortal souls. Of the Five Princes, three are known to maintain demenses, one maintains a habitation, and The Jester's lair (if it has one) is unknown. These domains are usually in one of two forms--demenses or habitations.

===Demenses===
Copies of the material plane or of astral landscapes, demenses are floating islands in the void. Maintaining such a pocket of normality in the hungry void of the Abyss is a sign of significant power. Three significant demenses are

====Shachtat--Gallery of Corruption====
Home to the [[Twisted]] One and his "artistic" distortions of form, this demense appears to be a vast ocean of dark water (although breathing is possible). Light only carries half as far as normal and radiant energies are muted. Strange slurping and gibbering sounds can be heard. The only lights are spotlights illuminating "artworks," living creature that have been twisted and warped into strange and horrific forms. These seem to be placed randomly around the lair. The Twisted One itself swims here, a corrupted kraken-like exile from Leviathan. His followers are also present, tending the "art."

Mechanical Elements:
Motion is possible in three dimensions. The entire area counts as difficult terrain unless the creature has a swim speed.
Resting in Shachtat is dangerous--at the end of a short or long rest a non-native creature must roll a Wisdom saving throw. The DC starts at 10 and increases by 5 for every subsequent rest attempt. On a failed save, the creature not only does not gain the benefit of the rest, but has disadvantage on all Intelligence or Wisdom based saving throws, attack rolls, and checks. This derangement persists unless removed by greater restoration or similar magic. The DC is reset only after spending a full week (8 days) outside of Shachtat.

====Ternovna--Garden of Thorns====
Ternovna appears to be a floating island in the midst of chaos. Approximately 10 miles in diameter (but irregularly shaped), this demense is dominated by the palace of [[Lloitira]]. Low and rambling with internal courtyards and gardens, Thorn-house appears inviting, almost sleepy. A formal hedge maze stretching over a third of the island; another section is covered in formal gardens. On closer inspection, all the plants are barbed, poisonous, and predatory. Unwary creatures get trapped and eaten by the maze (which shifts constantly) or by the hypnotic flowers. Deception is the order of the day. The palace itself echoes faintly with the sound of pleasure and pain. Implements of torture abound (and are wielded gleefully on and by the inhabitants). Illusion magic and shapeshifting are ubiquitous among the denizens of this place. Unlike the Twisted One (who collects only art and twists his servants to be more "useful), the Lady of Pain enjoys company and will often "hire" (knowingly or not) mortals to entertain her and her hedonistic court. She even pays them well, but very few escape without scars on body or soul from the experiences in that perverse place.

====Zubna--The Maw====
Physically the largest demense, Zubna is a vast jungle, dense with life. Unlike mortal jungles, everything here is savage and predatory. Unlike Ternovna, the predatory creatures here (including the plants) are hunters (some active, some ambush-style). Kill or be killed, eat or be eaten. Higher creatures (animals and humanoids alike) that die are reborn to start the cycle again unless unlucky enough to be killed and devoured by a soul-eater such as the Fang. Inhabited mostly by were-creatures and lovers of savagery and bloodshed, Zubna is dangerous place to visit. Stalking through this jungle is the fiercest predator of them all--the [[Red Fang]] himself. What civilization exists centers around the Grand Arena--a ramshackle pit where gladiatorial games take place constantly. All games are to the death (and usually end with the winner devouring the loser). Treasures can be won here, but the loser's soul itself is forfeit.

===Habitations===
Unlike demenses, habitations make no attempt at appearing like landscapes or mortal places. They are generally rooms, connected to one another by portals, although some are tiny flat disks with "buildings" on them, open to the void, with atmosphere maintained by the will of the creator. They float in the void--breaking through the walls drops one into the unstructured abyss. What windows appear show false landscapes or nothing at all, as the owner wishes. These take less power to maintain. Of the Princes, only [[Oro-laen]] maintains a habitation. There are an uncountable number of such habitations. Some stand empty--their owners dispersed or consumed by one of the other denizens of the abyss or slain in combat with other powers. These empty habitations slowly dissolve into the void.

====Dom-tizh--The Quiet House====
Oro-laen has no patience for landscapes or games. His habitation is the Quiet House, a labyrinthine complex of chambers and tiny islands in the void, connected by gates. Experiment chambers, libraries, reagent storage, specimen habitats--all are present in abundance. The Black Lord himself maintains a tasteful abode, decorated in dark polished wood, stone floors that never seem cold, and steady source-less lighting. The Quiet House is home to a variety of denizens, all united in their love of the less-well-regarded branches of magical research. Blood sacrifice, necromancy, soul-alterations, studies of the Dark Beyond, all of these are conducted in the sanctuary environment of Dom-tizh. Travelers should be wary of making agreements or promises within the boundaries of this habitation--all such promises (no matter how seriously they were intended) are binding as if enforced by the geas spell (except that this effect has no maximum duration).

==Oblivion's Gate==
At the very heart of the abyss is Terminus, the [[Oblivion Gate]]. An inky-black spheroid approximately 10 miles in diameter, Terminus writhes like a living thing, sending out flare-like tentacles at whatever matter comes near. It sheds a form of anti-light, shrouding its surface in mystery. Everything else in the abyss revolves around Terminus, as if it were the anti-sun in this mockery of a solar system. If Terminus makes contact with matter, the matter is instantly and completely obliterated. This makes Terminus both greatly feared by the inhabitants and very useful as a garbage disposal. The origin and purpose of Terminus are unknown--some say it was created as the heart of the abyss and the rest simply accumulated around it. Others claim it to be the ultimate mercy--those Incarnations who no longer wished to exist could dive in there and find an end. Yet others say that one day, at the end of the universe, it will grow until it consumes all the planes and then the Dream will end. Observers have noted, however, that a single object seems to orbit very close to Terminus, well within the flare-tentacles' reach, yet undisturbed. No one fool-hardy enough to try to reach the object has ever reported back, so its nature remains a mystery. What is known is that the Oblivion Gate is the source of the [[jotnar]] and thus the ultimate source of demons and undead.

      <text bytes="2308" sha1="tb7ze52s9ptxo5yb85l4i5z6mu2bmp3" xml:space="preserve">All scholars know the story of the origin of our sphere and its planar adjuncts. What lies beyond? Again, the answer is known to all, even children. The Dark Beyond, home of creatures alien to our reality, whose very presence warps and twists existence. But then, what of the One? It who created our sphere? It must have come from the Dark Beyond. How did It start? What else is there?

The Gods refuse to speak of this topic. Experiments in reaching to the Beyond to ask its denizens questions ended badly. Who else might know? In desperation, consumed by this question, I turned to Leviathan. With my mightiest spells I transformed myself into Leviathan and listened to my own song. While most of the knowledge faded once I was returned to mortal shape, I will write what I remember.

== Leviathan's Song ==
I remember the singing. We sang to ourself, for we are one but we are many. The deeps are not silent--they are filled with the slow, stately song of memory and of being. It echoes and is re-sung, layers of melody overlapping with itself, forming new song. This is the oldest song we sang:

 Mother Dark lay dreaming;
 Dreaming the endless dream.
 Does She still dream?
 In time without time?

 Into the dream came a thought:
 I am; I am ALONE.
 What is it to be?
 What is loneliness? 

 If there is self,
 There is other.
 And so other came to be.
 Children of the dreaming Dark.
 
 Creators and Destroyers,
 Darkness and Light.
 Each making and unmaking with a thought.
 
 ONE created nine, a world to shape:
 
 Air to move,
 Fire to burn,
 Earth to stand still,
 And Water to remember.
 
 Life to create,
 Death to bring peace,
 Good to look outward,
 Evil to take care of self.
 
 Watching for the coming of the Nameless, bearing change.

The last four stanzas obviously reference the creation of our world, Quartus. I believe that the rest refer to the Dark Beyond. That space between universes must be a realm where thought shapes reality--somehow, that eternal silence of oneness was broken. If the One came forth, so must have others, each creating and destroying as they saw fit. Is this then what the stars are? pinpricks through the Barrier at the Edge of the crystal sphere, showing other creations? Angelic beacons, lighting the way in their endless war?

;Usual Depiction: A white-haired woman, neither old nor young. Her eyes are silver. She is dressed in a simple floor-length gown with a fur mantle over it. Usually depicted facing a kneeling figure (exact details vary), wiping a tear from the figure’s eye with one hand on its head.

;Companions/Demigods: The [[Handmaiden]]

;Worship: Worshiped as part of the Seasonal Four in the Council Lands, especially by the elderly (especially women). Clergy are often responsible for grave upkeep. Only rarely worshipped in the Dynasty, due to associations with winter. Her temples are simple with only a simple altar (always covered with a lace-work snowflake cover). Her clergy often spend their younger years as traveling healers and grave-tenders. They retire to stationary shrines when they’re too old to travel. While they do not take vows of poverty, they do live simple lives. Her clergy are also always trained in combat, emphasizing anti-undead skills. Offerings to her are focused on memorializing the dead. Stories of their lives, simple incense, things like that. Her clergy accept food and shelter in exchange for healing and grave-tending, never money.

;Religious Precepts: Honor the dead, learn from the past. Suffer not the necromancer or his spawn to live. Live quietly. Grant mercy to the defeated living; protect those that are weak.  As the snow protects the winter wheat, preserve life with all its potential. Lay the undead to rest. Suffer not the lich to live. Respect the dead and their resting places.

      <text bytes="9336" sha1="iaqkxwzg15e1q1qj22y3da8go1yfes7" xml:space="preserve">Each of the three major cultural groups of the Council Lands approaches the worship of Powers (gods, demigods, ascended heroes, kami, etc) differently.

==Wall-Builders==
Wall-builders approach the gods as clients approach a patron. Each person chooses one of the Congregation that best fits their needs and personality as their patron. Thereafter they focus most of their devotions to that deity. They still venerate the others on their feast days and when special needs arise, but their daily and weekly devotions and sacrifices go to their patron. In return, they expect protection and beneficence in their daily lives from their patron.

Worship among wall-builders is split into two portions—public veneration and private instruction. In public all the gods are venerated by turns according to their feast days, although the four seasonal gods have pride of place. Priests may have a special relationship with one of the Congregants from whom they draw their limited power, but they serve the Congregation as a whole. Ritual symbolic sacrifices occur twice a week (on Fourday and Eightday); Fourday has a ritual assembly of the local worshipers. These services may at most have a ritualized homily or a story involving a Congregant or one of their demi-gods, but generally there is no instruction as to the will of the Congregation.

While the Congregants have priority, many wall builders also respect and appease the local spirits and revere historic and mythic heroes. Many of these are Accepted as demigods or ascendants. This is especially true in the [[Dreamshore]] region where the Church of the Seasons is least organized. Often village churches will have shrines to local heroes or kami alongside the altars dedicated to the Congregation.

===Divine Societies===
Instruction as to the desires of the Congregation comes through the societies dedicated to one of the Congregants. Each area may only have membership in a few of the societies—those of the seasonal gods are most common even in small areas.

Religious societies often have multiple layers—the deeper layers are exclusive and initiation is by invitation only. Different societies are organized differently—the main society devoted to the [[Tor Elan|Sun Lord]] selects the strongest member as the leader through ritual feats of strength, while [[Pinwheel]]’s tiny society has no fixed organization at all. Not all Congregants have public societies. On Eight-day the “public” layers meet. During this meeting some form of instruction is given on a topic relating to the Congregant’s doctrine and the members socialize and plan to meet the needs of their fellows.

Initiation into adolescence involves initiation into the local society of one of the gods—usually [[Sakara]] for young women and [[Tor Elan]] for young men. As the young person matures, they may be initiated into the deeper mysteries of that same god or may join the society of any of the others as they see fit. People can belong to multiple societies but can only dive deeper into one. Older women tend to gravitate toward the White Hands (the society dedicated to [[Melara]]), while older men tend toward the [[Moon-scythes]], the biggest society devoted to the [[Loran Hae|Lord of Autumn]]. Many are casual worshipers who never progress beyond the public layers of any of the societies. Some are public members of multiple societies and initiates of deeper mysteries of gods to whose public societies they don’t even belong.

===Major Societies===

;The Jeweled Rose ([[Aerielara]]): Only present in larger cities. Deeper initiates are almost always artists (including prostitutes) or famously beautiful.

;Overwatch (The [[Hollow King]]): No public side. Don’t look for them, they don’t exist. Existing or not, they are watching.

;The Coin-spinners ([[Kela-Loran]]): Favorite of merchants and gamblers. Initiation is for sale—the larger the “donation”, the higher the rank.

;The Silence ([[Korokonolkom]]): Commonest where dwarves and wall-builders mingle. Some sub-groups practice self-flagellation as a test of silent endurance.

;The Hot Forge ([[Lon-Ka]]): Welcoming innovators and artisans, their meetings are often confused for sage’s lectures or hands-on demonstrations. Or brawls. Or all of the above, all at once. “All things must be tested by fire,” after all.

;The Moon-scythes ([[Loran Hae]]): One of the largest societies, with public members everywhere. Especially older men. Forms the local court in rural areas.

;The White Hands ([[Melara]]): Mostly older women. Found everywhere and involved in everything. Works with the Arms of the Mother quite heavily.

;The Arms of the Mother ([[Peor-fala]]): A mutual-aid society *slash* gossip circle. Very prevalent among halflings.

;The Motley ([[Pinwheel]]): No public side. Often considered a fake group used as a punchline to a joke, like the Illuminati.

;The Ruby Castle ([[Roel Kor]]): By invitation only but not secret. Strict hierarchy and discipline. High prestige—only those of power and fame are invited.

;Cherry Petals ([[Sakara]]): Favorite of young women. Very pink. Teaches life skills.

;Storm-born ([[Selesurala]]): Tiny, private group. Egalitarian. Anarchists.

;Sun-shields ([[Tor-Elan]]): Major society for younger men. Initiation and rank are based on training and discipline and trial by combat. Conducts military drills open to everyone.

;Society for the Preservation of Knowledge ([[Yogg-Maggus]]): Conducts lectures on topics for the public. Initiation into the mysteries requires written tests.

[[Ytra]] and [[Lae Loara]] do not have societies. Ytra has her Order (the [[Scale-balancer]]s) and [[Lae Loara]] does not invite such followers. Hers is a wilder way.

==Council Dwarves==
Traditional [[dwarves]] relate to the [[Congregation]] as examples of proper life. They discuss teachings, they tell and retell stories about the acts of the gods. Their prayers are more a means of centering themselves and reviewing what they know than an actual request for supernatural aid. Most dwarves turn first to the teachings of the [[Korokonolkom|Lord of the Mountain]], but the [[Lon-Ka|Forge-master]] is another source of inspiration.

Unlike the wall-builders, dwarves focus on doctrine and teachings, especially on debating and discussing the law of each deity. Different schools exist which focus on different teachings (or different understandings of teachings. These schools of thought often form over what seem to be minute differences in wording, parsing logic and phrasing to a fine level. For the rest of the Council Lands, calling something “dwarven theology” is saying that it’s designed to be confusing and is often said of semantic or word-twisting arguments. This goes beyond just the specialists—a common dwarven pass-time in the dark of the mountains is to argue over particularly esoteric doctrines or symbols.

Dwarves thus get a reputation for being very religious, something that often makes them smile. To many dwarves, wall-builders are the fanatics. Dwarves simply treat the gods as they do their own exemplars—if one came down and started giving orders, the dwarves would start arguing with the god using examples from their own teachings. Another common phrase is that something impossible is “like preaching religion to a dwarf.”

Traditional dwarves, as a rule, will revere ancestors as exemplars but do not deify them and do not venerate kami. The more “progressive” hill dwarf clans are looser about this, but the traditionalist mountain dwarves are firm on this point.

==Council Elves==
Elves are generally not very religious. To them, the Congregation are late-comers and aren’t that impressive. They’re important for humans, they say, because humans don’t have true power (wizardry for the [[gwerin]] and druidic power for the [[puun ihmisia]]). To the elves, the gods are a useful shortcut. Their power makes them valid sources for transactional worship—prayer or sacrifice in exchange for measurable gifts.

Those elves that are religious tend to devote themselves to one aspect of one Congregant—religious artists may devote themselves to [[Aerielara]], while wizards might patronize [[Yogg Maggus]]. Those that are strongly religious tend to become zealots, lacking the cultural underpinnings of faith. They focus on one facet to the exclusion of the others. A zealot of the Lord of Magic might throw away all ethical restrictions in the pursuit of magic; a devotee of the Lady of Beauty might go to any length to chase music or art or sexuality. Saying someone is an “elven believer” is to warn that they’ve become a fanatic. Or, conversely, that someone doesn’t take the gods seriously at all. Phrases are double-edged, after all.

Gwerin generally do not venerate ancestors or [[kami]]. Especially not kami. High-elven druids are vanishingly rare and are looked down on as race traitors. Having powerful ancestors is a source of pride but they’re much more focused on power in the present. [[Puun ihmisia]], on the other hand, are almost entirely focused on the kami. Ancestors may be acknowledged, but the local kami are of paramount importance. Every home, street-corner, and village gate has a shrine; impromptu shrines grow wherever a spirit is found to be active.

      <text bytes="5618" sha1="9p4mz91gturg9spayyf47nngrrew30a" xml:space="preserve">In the [[Prehistory|beginning]], the Dreamer created the 8 + 1 Primordials to aid him in the construction of a world in the Dreaming Dark. To serve them in their tasks It created the Progenitor Races, numbering six. This is the story of the Proteans, the cursed servants of the Nameless and their fate after the Dawn War.

==Children of Change==
===Proteans===
The proteans were a fluid race, originally destined to be the ambassadors between the Primordial servant races. They were capable of changing shape at will and communicating with all races by sharing thoughts.

For the rebellion of their Primordial prince they were condemned, bound to the mortal plane and stripped of all their glory. Their intelligence was taken from them, leaving them barely better than animals. Their fluidity of form was constrained; their telepathic speech was hobbled, restricted to the subconscious of their kind. In short, they had become goblins. Primitive and broken, the goblins were enslaved by all the other races and driven into the waste places of the world.

It is theorized that gnomes were descended from proteans who threw themselves on the mercy of the Eight during the Dawn War. They were stripped of their fluidity and telepathy and driven into the wilds, but retained much of their intelligence. Since gnomes went extinct at the Cataclysm, this remains simply a theory, much debated among scholars. For other theories, see [[Gnomes]].

===Goblin-kind===
Main Article: [[Goblins]]
The direct descendants of the proteans. They have regained some of their lost intelligence over the mortal ages but still are well short of their ancient kin.

===Humans===
Main Article: [[Humans]]

The origin of humankind is still debated. Since the discovery by the Catalysts in the Four Towers of documents proving that humans are descended from goblin-kin, much research has taken place to pin down the exact nature of that connection. The leading theories are that either humans' ancestors were hobgoblins who wanted to break away from their tribes and cure their sterility or that they were hobgoblins modified by eladrin wizards. Either way, the veracity of the hobgoblin connection is unquestionable at this point. It is known that humans first appeared during the First Interregnum (about 3500 years before the Cataclysm), along with orcs.

Humanity came into its own only one thousand years later, when they enacted the Third Wish and started the Third Age of Quartus. They were the first to channel divine power; they quickly learned the ways of sorcery, of shamanism, and of the arcane.

===Orcs===
Main Article: [[Orcs]]

Orcs and humans appeared in the historical record almost simultaneously. It is believed that orcs were hobgoblins modified by wood elf shamans in an attempt to create super-soldiers. They were intractable, however, possessed with a simmering anger that made them wholly unsuitable for disciplined warfare. The descendants of those that escaped into the wilds gathered in clans. Matriarchal (because women are less affected by the rage) and shamanistic, the orcs have only recently partially joined the ranks of civilized peoples as part of [[Wyrmhold]].

===Dragonborn===
Main Article: [[Dragonborn]]

Dragonborn are the oldest race of which clear records exist of their creation. They were created in 753 BC by the Western Empire in an attempt to create more biddable super soldiers. This act of hubris was the spark that started the Fall of Empire, a civil war that lasted nearly 100 years and knocked half a continent back into a dark age that it took 600 years to recover from. The experiment was a qualified success--the dragonborn breed true and are excellent soldiers. Fewer in number than most other races, they have gathered in the Remnant Dynasty.

===Serpent-kin===
Main Article: [[Ophidian]]s

Created in much the same way as the dragonborn (and at about the same time), the snake-infused Ophidians were created by the [[Gwerin]] rulers of the [[Fanged Kingdom]] to be servants and living decorations. The more humanoid ones form the underclass of the Stone Throne while the abominations with ophidian limbs or heads are classed as untouchable and are not afforded full rights of citizenship.

===Plane-touched===
Main Article: [[plane-touched]].
The more bigoted among the elves say that humans will breed with anything that moves. While that is not entirely true, there have been multiple known instances of visitors from other planes interbreeding or strongly influencing humans in a way that produces lasting changes to the progeny of those touched. Collectively, they are the plane-touched. Most of these changes are recessive and skip generations.

Common varieties include
- Celestial plane-touched, hailing from the influence of the celestial forces (those that directly serve the will of the [[Great Mechanism]] and [[Congregation]].
- Infernal plane-touched, hailing from the influence of fiendish forces (both devilish and demonic).
- Elemental plane-touched, hailing from the influence of the elemental planes.

===Halflings===
Main Article: [[Halflings]]

The youngest race, halflings were born of goblin stock in the demonic aftereffects of the Fall of Empire. Somewhere between goblins and humans, they have become a solid race that has a bright future ahead of itself. They are found almost exclusively in the Council Lands, but primitive halfling tribes inhabit the jungles north of the Stone Throne. Be warned, however--those primitive tribes are frequently cannibalistic and almost uniformly unfriendly to outsiders.

      <text bytes="1819" sha1="dz1anci54pvh8t8whlpdqhevkc41brz" xml:space="preserve">The Brightsong is the ranking bard of the Bard’s College at the [[Granite-Flame Academy]]. Dovara took on that role in 201 AC, and held it until her death during the [[Guildmasters]] Rebellion of 227. Although some claimed that she rose to fame because her father is the [[Immortal Bard]] himself, but she showed herself to be a competent and effective leader. Politically she took few sides, preferring to sit back and lob bombs to keep people arguing. If pressed, she’d say that gridlock is better than letting them make stupid decisions. Really, she just liked getting people to react. She loved drama. Personally, she was known as a world-class flirt (just like her father) who loved to tavern-crawl, especially in the rougher areas.

;Demographic Information: In 211 AC, Dovara was an attractive middle-aged half elf in her mid 50s, but looks much younger. Her height (5’9”) and her bright copper-colored hair and green eyes set her apart from the common folk. She wore clothes cut in the common mode (rather than the fancy styles of the rich) but made from fine fabrics and secretly full of hidden pockets. Her preferred instrument was a finely-made lute. Mechanically she was a Bard (VGtM) except with the spell casting of a 7th level caster (4th level spells).

;Personality: Nobody stays angry at me or around me for long, since I can defuse any amount of tension. Unless I want them to be. I’m good at pressing buttons.

;Ideal: Independence. I am a free spirit--no one tells me what to do.

;Bond: My instrument is my most treasured possession, and it reminds me of someone I love.

;Flaw: I once satirized a powerful man who still wants my head. It was a mistake that I will likely repeat.

;Alignment: CG

air-EE-uh-LAH-rah

==== Other names ====
The Jeweled Lady, Lady of Beauty

====Usual depiction====
A [[gwerin]] woman of unsurpassed beauty, wearing little except strategically placed gemstones. Her hair color is iridescent and her pose is scandalous. Usually white marble or alabaster skin.

====Companions/Demigods====
[[Lyre-plucker T’a]], [[Mad Martigan]], The [[Dancer in the Dark]]

====Worship in Western Noefra====
Commonly worshiped by artists, musicians, bards, and prostitutes. Her clergy, both men and women, are always beautiful and charismatic. Her temples (which are many, especially among the [[gwerin]] and the rich) are beautifully decorated in rich materials. Youths are often tutored in sexual arts at these temples before they marry. For humans and [[gwerin]] there is very little stigma to patronizing one of her acolytes. The second-most worshiped deity in the [[Jungle of Fangs]], especially among the Isal classes. There the primary focus is dance and rhythmic music. In beauty hides thorns—her clergy often are also trained in poisons and unarmed self-defense.

=====Religious Precepts===== 
Truth is found in beauty; ugliness is evil. Give in to passion—do what makes you happy without regard for the judgement of others. Spread beauty and pleasure, destroy ugliness and misery.

====Worship in Other Areas====
* [[Ikela]]: A minor part of the [[Ikelan Religion|CCU]]. Mainly worshiped in her role as patron of the arts rather than her more sensual aspects.
* [[Phoenix Empire]]: Worship of Aerielara is forbidden (yet very common in secret); other supposed ascendants such as the Eternal Emperor are worshiped in her place (openly anyway).

====Domain==== 
Lust. Sexuality. Beauty. Art/Music. Life, Trickery

====Personality==== 
Vain. The musician of the Gods. Beautiful and sensual. Deceptively intelligent.

Estate on [[Mara]]. Part museum, exhibition area, theater, and brothel all in one.

====[[Divine Rank]]====
Congregant.

====Political affiliation====
Peace Faction

====Pre-Divine Status====
A [[gwerin]] noble from the [[Phoenix Empire]]. A bard of no uncommon skill as well as a dancer, she was notorious for breaking every taboo of that hidebound empire. It wasn't until the last days before the [[Cataclysm]], when she refused the wrong noble and fell from grace, leading to her assassination. As her soul departed, the [[Cataclysm]] took hold and the [[Great Mechanism]] chose her as one of the new Divine Congregation.

      <text bytes="2706" sha1="o89tb0meccm54zxbsx54bjusay2gpxy" xml:space="preserve">The representatives from the Mining Guild in 211 AC were the [[Tsetseg]]-clan Exemplar Couple, Adrik and Bardryn. Mountain dwarves to the core, these two are the unshakeable bedrock of the Council. Made Exemplars and assigned to the Council nearly 100 years ago, they are the senior members (barring the [[Immortal Bard]] and the Dragon). They were granted joint [[Exemplar|Exemplar of Endurance]] status for working for 32 days straight without sleeping to finish the construction of the Fuar-Uulan aqueduct before the onset of the spring melt (that otherwise would have washed it away).

Adrik rarely says anything, but when he does it’s final and the rest of the Council usually follows his lead. He frequently looks like he’s asleep, but so far attempts to deceive him have failed, usually backfiring tremendously. When his ire is raised he’s ruthless in pressing the attack against the one that angered him. While he may forget, he never forgives.

Bardryn is the velvet that conceals his steel. She comes across as kind and matronly, but should not be thought of as weak. Fools have attempted to play them off against each other--that’s a good way to get them both mad. She’s just as ruthless, but much more subtle. She does most of the talking for the two of them.

Politically they’re rock-ribbed conservatives. Tradition is not just important, tradition is everything. Masters of precedent, they have rules quotes and previous decisions dating back to the founding of the Council memorized and ready to deploy. They do believe in the Council--some say that they are the only thing keeping the Council from disintegrating at the hands of the monarchists and the separatists.

;Demographic Information: Ancient mountain dwarves, they’re nearing the end of their lifespan (~150 years). She’s grey haired, he’s balding with a white beard. Both are paunchy but still strong. They wear simple mining clothes--a tunic, suspenders, trousers, and stout leather boots with hobnails. Neither went anywhere without their “canes”, which are serviceable clubs. Mechanically they were Nobles (MM). Their deaths in 217 (of natural causes, although foul play was suspected) were the touch-point that started the [[Crystal Spire War]] and destabilized the [[Council Lands]].  

;Personality: Once I make up my mind, there’s no stopping me. (both)

;Ideal: Tradition. The old ways are the best ways--that fence is there for a reason.

;Bond: The Council Lands are my home, and I will protect them from anyone or anything.

;Flaw: Stubborn to a fault. Can be very ruthless if angered.

;Alignment: LG

Anything that would allow someone to reconstruct the work has been excised. 

As souls are made of anima, magic can manipulate those souls, consuming them as fuel or transplanting pieces of them into other things. The soul-manipulations described here fall into two broad categories--blood magic and nimbus transplants.

==Blood Magic--Souls as Fuel==
At its most basic, blood magic is the use of anima harvested from living beings as fuel for enchantments or rituals. This is true whether the anima is surrendered willingly or not. While both animals and sophonts have anima, the much greater density of a sophont's nimbus makes them more efficient candidates.

===Living Sacrifice===
Most of the directly useful anima in an individual is in the nimbus--the body is too compressed to be readily convertible and the spark is difficult to manipulate. This leads to the crudest form of blood magic--the sacrifice of a living thing in a ritual. If the soul is not a willing sacrifice, the bonds between body and nimbus must be weakened, often through torture or through vivisection. Once the nimbus has been detached, the practitioner channels it into the desired shape. &lt;diagrams and details removed&gt; This inevitably snuffs out the spark, leading to the destruction of the person that was. This practice is terribly wasteful--an average person contains approximately 400 thaums of anima. At most 5 of that (usually less) is recoverable this way.

Editor's Note: a thaum is an archaic unit of magical energy; it represents the energy needed to magically heat one person-weight of water to a comfortable bath temperature. Animals, despite their much higher vitality, have lower extractable anima due to their weaker nimbuses.

More sophisticated containment and channeling constructs can help, but the theoretical efficiency of "traditional" blood magic is only 32%, much too low to practically power the needs of the Empire without depopulating large swaths of the countryside. Traditional blood magic is also difficult to store, as most proper vessels can't intake the power fast enough, resulting in significant waste due to conversion inefficiency. As a result, traditional blood magic is the domain of cults and demon-worshippers who need large bursts of energy and aren't concerned about waste.

===Soul Compactification===
One hundred and 3 years ago [943 BC] the research team led by [[Sapientum Korvan]] of the Imperial Research University discovered a method to compress the entire soul, including body, nimbus and spark, into a small solid block. Each such block contains approximately 350 thaums, enough to power [[Imperial Research Alpha]] at full output for an entire day. Including conversion losses, this is an efficiency of 80%, more than 2.5x the best possible efficiency for traditional blood magic. Although the yield is lower, this process can convert dead bodies into fuel as well. As an additional benefit, these blocks are shelf-stable and non-volatile, so they can be stored and transported easily.

&lt;diagrams and instructions removed&gt;

The Korvan Process was a major advance, but it had some drawbacks. First and foremost, both the conversion ritual and the consumption ritual require the active participation of a circle of arcanists and is relatively exhausting. This limits the utility of this process significantly. In addition, the ritual weakens the fabric of the world, causing elemental or spirit-based magics to act strangely (including not functioning entirely) in the surrounding area. Participants in the rituals must be rotated out frequently or else they run the risk of becoming saturated with the anima, leading to unpredictable exclusion events (editor: this means that they became demonic and were forcibly excluded from reality and ejected into the [[Abyss]]).

The present results describe how these drawbacks can be ameliorated. By amalgamating several souls and anchoring it into a single, non-biological container (described below, designated as "conduit") and using this combined soul as a conduit (both for Korvan conversion and utilization), the process can proceed without interruption. Encasing the reactor in a high-density casing of abyssal-aspected anima (in the form of obsidian that has been exposed to demonic energies using the Tor'al'eim ritual), the contamination can be contained entirely, although the conduit does experience significant warping effects.

&lt;details removed&gt;

==Nimbus Transplants--Moving the Soul==
The other, newer, use of soul energy is to move the soul from one container to another. This takes several forms, labeled "anchoring" and "fusion."

===Anchoring===
Anchoring is the process of extracting a living spirit (spark and nimbus) from a body and housing that spirit into an inanimate object. Not all spirits are suitable for this process--unless a spirit is particularly strong it tends to disintegrate on extraction. In many cases this is acceptable, as many spirits can be combined into a single viable entity (sharing traits of all of them but not having any of the personalities of the original creatures). The destination for the anchored soul is a sphere of magicite (grade III or better, &lt;other details removed&gt;). Once housed in a properly prepared housing (which can be as small as the [[magicite]] vessel permits or as large as a building), the spirit takes that housing as a body and can manipulate it as needed. The one drawback of this process is that due to the imperfect attachment of the soul to its new vessel, the anchored being can no longer produce its own anima; as such, without an outside source of power it will inevitably fragment and degenerate into madness and senescence at a rate depending on the strength of the soul and on the fit between body and soul. 

The anchoring process requires a conduit--an outside living soul that guides the soul to be anchored and preserves it in transit. At Imperial Research Alpha, this is part of the responsibilities of [[IULIA]] (Intelligent Unembodied Living Infrastructure Amalgam), the aforementioned amalgam entity. Housed in the central core of the research facility, this amalgam of four souls facilitates all the soul-transfer work (including the Korvan Process) of the facility. Without IULIA, the fusion research of the facility would be impossible. Since it is constantly fed by the Korvan reactor's output, it is safe from senescence. It also houses backups of all the research conducted at the facility, as well as a complete duplicate of the Imperial Library, updated monthly.

The process requires &lt;removed&gt;.

===Fusion===
Fusion is a brand-new process developed by [[Grand Sapientum Iorda]]. It is destined to eclipse the archaic methods used by the eldadrin and wood elves of yore to create new species--no more do we need to inject small amounts of aspected anima into recipients and breed the survivors together for generations (as the eladrin did) or convince animal spirits to possess the breeding groups and select for the persisted traits over time. Instead, we can create new species by directly fusing fragments gathered from the souls of the donor species into the growing souls of fetuses, skipping the intermediate generations and tuning the outcome to our desires. Adults can be modified in a more limited fashion, but those attempts usually produce sub-par results.

We have found that the best donor souls come from powerful creatures such as dragons; attempts have been made to acquire a Leviathan sample or one of the major giant species, these attempts have failed. We have achieved limited success with animal species as donors or recipients, but blendings between sophonts and animals have always resulted in non-sophont intelligence. Our current donors are two dragons--a green and a red. We have 6 eggs in stasis; donors are disposed of once they reach the adult threshold (when their strength becomes too great to restrain).

The best results for recipients have come when groups of women (mostly human, although goblins have also been used for this) are recruited, brain-wiped, and then repeatedly impregnated by chosen males; the resulting fetuses are treated at 4, 16, and 32 weeks gestation. The altered specimens are removed from their mothers and raised by brain-wiped wet-nurses until they can enter training creches at the age of 18 months. Brood-mares are utilized at 50% intensity and usually last 4-8 cycles.

&lt;remaining details removed&gt;.

==Game Mechanic Notes==
The thaumic content of a creature is a function of its hit points and is given by the equation E = 100 (HP)&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;, where p = 1 (if the creature is of near-normal intelligence) or p = 1/2 (if the creature is only of animal intelligence). It is believed that some fantastic beasts have p-values even higher, but that is unconfirmed.

      <text bytes="6549" sha1="o68jcrr9okgjgmosombmi76aj6ev9mw" xml:space="preserve">[[Infernals]] are grouped into 45 families, organized into 5 territories. Most families are named for the arch-devil that occupies the role of Don; exceptions include the Grigori and the Hinn. The territories and their constituent families are described below.

==Thoraz==
They mainly work for the angels; only the weaker ranks interact with mortals. Heavily involved in elemental planes. Politically conservative. Based in the [[Machinarium]] of the [[Celestial City]].

===Families===
;Ala (NE): Known for driving hard bargains. Greedy, he works his subordinates hard and rewards ambition, as long as that ambition doesn't threaten him.
;Barong (NG): Associated with lions; her Family specializes in anti-demon operations.
;Charun (LN): Dour and quiet, specializes in anti-undead operations
;Culsu (N): Known as the Doorwarden, this Family controls passage from the mortal plane into Shadow.
;Grigori (N): This family specializes in scrying and spying on creatures. Led by an imp whose desire for information has given him lots of blackmail material. Unlike most of the territory, they're neutral like arms-dealers are neutral--they supply both sides with information.
;Malphas (LN): This family specializes in construction and is dominantly involved in maintenance of the Celestial City. Only rarely summoned to the mortal plane.
;Marchosias (LG): Judge of fair battles and duels. Considered stick-in-the-muds by others.
;Pelesit (N): Specializes in defensive operations, provides combat troops for mortal-plane operations.
;Valac (CN): Finder of Treasures (even other people's treasures). Experts at scrying for objects.

==Mara-deva==
Many succubi/incubi. 2nd-most-commonly summoned. Corruption/seduction/deception over brute force. Politically progressive. Based in [[Mara]].

===Families===
;Akvan (CN): Foremost fashion experts in the Astral Plane, for when you need to look devilishly good.
;Abyoza (CE): Often summoned to track down rivals or to lay curses on adulterous spouses. Also summoned to engineer the fall of political or economic rivals.
;Bakasura (LE): The most militant of the Mara-deva families, Bakasura is there for you when you need your enemies crushed with style.
;Drekavac (NE): When you need someone scared to death (literally or figuratively), Drekavac has a nice installment plan that will fit any soul's budget.
;Forneus (LE): Spin-meisters supreme. If you need someone to write a great speech (especially if the raw truth won't work), they're your devils.
;Ipos (NG): An Ipos imp on your shoulder will feed you all the right lines to cut your sparring partner down to size and the courage to deliver them. The courage tends to be that of the wine-cup, however.
;Lempo (CG): A two-edged sword--romance is their forte, but so is rather unpredictable behavior. You may end up proposing to the wrong sister (or their cow!) if you fall under Lempo's influence.
;Pruflas (CE): When there's nothing you like more than causing a ruckus, Pruflas has you covered. Ranging from practical jokes to impersonations designed to make your target see red, provocation is their wheelhouse.
;Shax (CE): Need something that isn't yours? Call Shax. Keep a firm grasp on your soul, or they'll steal that too.

==Chou==
Most often called for combat. Straight-forward and brutal. Respect strength. Politically conservative. Not fond of mortals (or anything they consider weak). Based in [[Ghenna]].

===Families===
;Aeshema (CE): Kill! Crush! Rage against chains!
;Angra Manyu (CE): All that exists must be destroyed. All returns to non-existence, to be reborn. 
;Aseg (LE): The stones of the earth are my army; all foes will break against their bulwark. Beauty is for those weak fools in Mara-deva. Our looks are another weapon.
;Gualichu (NE): What I have, I keep. That includes the bodies I possess. Like a puppet master, I manipulate them all.
;Hinn (N): Cry havoc and let slip the (flaming) dogs of war! Who's a good hell-hound? You're a good hell-hound. 
;[[Kroni]] (CE): Kill, kill, kill, annihilate, kill...
;Kumbhakarna (LN): Come! Let us test our might against each other.
;O Tokata (NE): The dead do not lie quiet. As soon you will know when you join them.
;[[Zagan]] (LE): I am the only king! All will bend the knee to my majesty!

==Leiutis==
Least warlike, most likely to form familiar pacts or Warlock pacts. Frequent users of blackmail. Politically progressive. Based in [[Aaru]]. Smallest territory in numbers.

===Families===
;Abraxas (LN): Want to know about the planes beyond the Material? We can help with that...for a price, of course.
;Allocer (N): The arcane arts are our stock in trade. What do you want to know? It's all available, if you can pay the price, of course.
;[[Beleth]] (CG): The harmonies of the celestial spheres will flow into you...once the golden ring of your anima sounds in our ears.
;Danjal (CN): Need someone taught a skill? Taught how to fight? We provide drill masters. Bulk rates available!
;Orobas (CN): The truth is out there...and we can find it for you.
;Phenex (NE): We make sure that the truth isn't out there, even against Orobas.
;Puloman (N): What happens when you mix this and that? We can tell you before you blow your fingers off!
;Ravan (N): Want to know how to appease that angry deity or kami? Need to know the right prayers to activate that temple? Call Puloman!
;Ukobach (N): All the best recipes, all in one place. Subscription plans available, cheap!

==Ka-Kola==
Not cohesive. Each family is independent. Wide variation. Politics as marked. Based in [[Naga Padoha]], but present all over.

===Families===
;Anzu (CN): The Mother of Monsters aids those that create monsters in Her name. Unaligned (apathetic)
;Arunasura (CE): Those that fight the gods are our allies. Unaligned (kill them all)
;Bukavac (N): Ours is the azure watch, over oceans and those that live within. Unaligned (apathetic)
;Boruta (N): We guard the green forests; the trees are our sheep. Unaligned/Conservative
;Dzoavits (CN): Burn! Burn in the fires of the deep earth! Raise up islands and mountains! Unaligned (kill them all)
;Leyak (CN): We guard all those whose ancestors were of the Races of Man, yet are created at the hands of the Races of Man. Progressive
;Namtar (N): Disease and medicine are opposite sides of the same coin; one without the other does not exist. Progressive
;Surgat (CN): All that is closed must be opened/as soon as Culu closes a door, we open a window. Conservative
;Toyol (NE): Who better to break that curse than the ones who laid it? Progressive

      <text bytes="2410" sha1="j6qgec2sdoxbtd75ytgkq6mj5kczlow" xml:space="preserve">Master Fallowfield, Master of the Grain Alliance, was the junior Agriculture Guild representative on the council from 201AC through the dissolution of the council in 217 AC. At that point he'd served for 10 years (to [[Thorngage Bree|Thorngage]]’s 20). He oversees the Grain Alliance, responsible for producing the grains of every kind that keep the [[Council Lands]] running. His people are primarily in the [[Sea of Grass]] region and are always looking for new farmland. As a result, he’s a strong proponent of expansion into the unclaimed regions toward the south west.

Politically he’s one of the founding members of the [[Committee for Realignment]], which is the public-facing arm of the group that advocates for the conversion of the Council into a de jure oligarchy with a hereditary nobility. It’s rumored that he helped fund the [[Human League]], the human-supremacy group that was crushed by the [[Catalysts]] five years ago, but the [[Scale Balancer]]s were never able to find hard evidence. He’s also known for enjoying some of the [[Council Lands]]’ more edgy entertainment.

He was forcibly retired from the Council in 217 AC when it was disbanded after the [[Crystal Spire War]]. He resented this loss of power, and his [[Committee for Realignment]], later led by his son [[Daelin Fallowfield]], was instrumental in the [[Guildmasters]] Rebellion of 227 AC. Now nearly 80, he has retired from public life but still has considerable persuasive power in the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]].

;Demographic Information: Darvin is a hard, tall (for a wall-builder), lean human male of about 40 years of age (in 211 AC). Dark brown curly hair and dark skin complete the look. He always wears austere coats and trousers, and his shoes are always polished to a shine. He has had two contract wives (the first died in childbirth) and five children, one of whom is an overseer in one of his subordinate associations. He’s rarely at home with his family. Mechanically, he’s a Noble (MM). 

;Personality Trait: I get bitter if I'm not the center of attention.

;Ideal: Might. The strongest are meant to rule.

;Bond: I’ve made deals to get where I am, and owe powerful people in the shadows.

;Flaw: When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.

;Alignment: NE

Of all the Federated Nations members, [[Byssia]] is the most homogeneous in fashion. The three races (and four cultures) all wear very similar garments. There aren’t hard distinctions between social classes but there is a spectrum that correlates with wealth and leisure. Everyone wears as bright of colors as they can afford; only the poorest wear sun-faded fabrics.

===General Trends=== 
Wool, cotton, and silk are the dominant fabrics, with cotton being more common than in other lands. Fasteners such as ties, buttons, and hooks are much less common than in other lands, with drapery and wraps held in place by friction or knotting taking their place. Clothing is loose and light, mainly serving as protection from the semi-tropical sunlight.

One major peculiarity is the almost complete absence of metal. Byssia uses wood and stone (often magically treated for hardness and durability) where other nations use metal. Ornaments are carved wood, set with stones or carved bones (one particular fish produces an ivory-like knob on its head).

===Undergarments=== 
All Byssians wear a loin-wrap as their primary undergarment. Females often wear a triangular halter-top that goes over the neck and ties at the back, leaving the shoulders and back bare. This usually does not cover the abdomen at all.

===Footwear=== 
Byssians by-and-large wear wooden sandals with raised soles, called paduka. These may or may not have straps--some simply have a raised knob that goes between the big toe and the second toe. While the poor may have very simple ones, the wealthy may have exotic wood or intricate carvings. In forested areas, these sandals give way to leather boots similar to those of the [[Puun Ihmisia|puun ihmisia]].

===Hair=== 
The hair-styles depend slightly on race and culture. The night’s children all have straight, jet-black hair. They tend to leave it long (to the shoulders or mid-back at least) and pull it back or put it in light braids. The native coasters, what few haven’t been assimilated yet, tend to have curly brown hair. This is usually cut relatively short. The pure elves wear their hair much like the [[Puun Ihmisia|puun ihmisia]] of the [[Council Lands]] (as they’re close relatives). All the other groups tend to mimic the dominant night’s children once they gain wealth.

===Clothing of the poor===
The poor, as well as the mendicant monks is very simple. A poor Byssian often just wears their loin-wrap (and possible halter) with sandals. A woven straw hat keeps the sun off (although night’s children only rarely tan or burn in the sunlight, despite their very pale skin). They may wrap themselves in a simple length of cloth to cover the upper body and the upper thighs, similar to the dhoti of Earth’s Indian subcontinent. Many, however, have one feast-day garment, similar to the clothing regularly worn by their wealthier compatriots.

====Mendicant Monks==== 
An order of monks associated with the [[Home of the Elements]] monastery wanders the land, seeking understanding of the nature of the elements and the kami. They can be identified by their shaved heads (very unusual), their staffs which are all made of ironwood (a glossy red-black, very hard wood native to the region), and their dhoti. There are four garbs, one for each element: seekers after Fire wears crimson, those trying to understand Air wears a bright yellow-orange (amber color), Water a deep grey-blue, and Earth an emerald green. They are sworn to poverty for the duration of their pilgrimages and work for food and shelter along the way. Since many are capable elemental sages, they often trade magical service for food, healing being a common service. They also provide a subtle police force, as they’re generally trained in unarmed combat. Don’t assume that humble-looking man or woman with a red staff is a non-combatant.

===Clothing of the wealthy/feast-day clothing=== 
Unlike the poor, there is substantial gender difference in the wealthy clothing (which is also the feast-day/festival clothing of the poor).

====Male clothing==== 
Men wear a long, cassock-style robe over loose trousers tied at the waist and ankles with a cord. The robe is usually of thin cotton or silk and often open down to the middle of the chest. While the robe is plain in color (white being common), the trousers are brightly colored and embroidered.

Wealthy men traditionally wear a wrapped head-covering in formal settings, much like a turban. This is elaborately decorated and often studded with colorful stones or feathers. While wearing this turban, men usually wear their hair up in a knot at the back of the head.

====Female clothing==== 
Wealthy women wear the halter-top constantly. This they pair (at a minimum) with a wrapped skirt of colorful, patterned cloth. This varies in length depending on the individual, but is always at least knee length.

For formal occasions, they add a sari-like garment of a single piece of cloth wrapped around the waist and thrown over one shoulder (leaving the other bare). This is made from the finest, thinnest material they can afford and brightly patterned, often in clashing colors. Their hair is pulled up and held in place by bone or wooden combs, often brightly decorated and carved into intricate shapes.

Decorations of fine lace are common, as are screened and printed fabrics. Embroidery is less common, although needlework lace is normal.

When outside, wealthy women will sometimes wear a hood-like head-covering much like the Arab hijab (covering the hair and neck), more for protection from the fierce sun rather than for modesty.

====Judicial Garb====
Byssia is a democratic kritarchy (rule by elected judges). The leaders of communities and the nation as a whole, the judges, wear particular garb while actively discharging their duties. This consists of an enveloping, ankle-length black robe that shows no skin (including the scalp and hair), along with a simple wooden mask, featureless except for a slit for the mouth and two slits for the eyes. Even the hands are covered by thin white cotton gloves; the feet are encased in black-leather boots. This symbolizes putting off all personal attachments to a case or to people in service of the law. They do not wear this most of the time, only when actively judging a case.

==Lowlands Culture==
Main Article: [[Byssian Lowlands]]

Byssians are an open, friendly people. Family matters a lot to them. Most villages are composed of a few large extended families, heavily intermarried. The rice paddies and cotton fields are worked as a community. Status is less about wealth (since so much is held communally) and more about having important ancestors. Most Byssians can trace their ancestry back to well before the Cataclysm. Those whose direct ancestors were priestesses or priest-mages are considered high status.
===Traveler Housing=== 
Travelers are accommodated in the village longhouse. This is usually free, although travelers usually pay by exchanging stories. Particularly honored guests may find a young woman (or man, or both) attending them in their bedrooms--bearing a child by a notable visitor is an honor and no further obligation is presumed from the visitor.
===Diet=== 
Rice, plain or in noodles. Fish, rarely pork or chicken. Spicy/savory (not sweet). Curry with coconut. Rice and fruit liquors (sake)
===Taboos and superstitions===
A portion of each meal must be offered to the local [[kami]] and to the ancestors. When returning home after a trip, one must visit the local shrine and alert the local kami to your return by clapping three times loudly, stating “Oh kami that guide and protect, your child has returned to your lands,” and bowing from the waist to the shrine. Red skies in the morning signal that the [[Selesurala|Storm Serpent]] is angry--prepare for stormy weather.

==Highlands Culture==
Main Article: [[Byssian Highlands]]

Xenophobic. Travelers are not welcomed unless they bear tokens of introduction from trusted sources and carry gifts of materials not available in the highlands (such as grains).
===Traveler Housing===
None. If accepted by a tribe, you might be able to camp nearby.
===Diet=== 
Hunter-gatherer, little grain (imported rice). Meat, fish, insects. Fruits &amp; greens.
===Taboos and superstitions===
A portion of each meal must be offered to the local [[kami]] and to the ancestors. Do not speak of the dead by name. To do so is to risk the creation of angry [[undead]]. When you greet a newcomer, test their strength by ritually slapping them across the face. Crossing the wrists is bad luck (symbolizing slave cuffs).

The [[dwarves]] are the more common (at least in [[Noefra]]) of the two; the giant kindred are the others. The name the learned use for the giant kindred is the jazuu, the Written People. While most people in the [[Federated Nations]] believe that the jazuu belong to multiple races, the truth is more complicated.

==Regions and Cultures==
===Oelfra===
The [[Oelfra]]n continent is home to the vast majority of jazuu. They dominate the southern portion and have constructed major cities. As of 250 AC, nothing is known more about this content or its cultures; what is known comes from fragmentary records indicating that the continent is home to jazuu, [[dwarves]], [[goblins|goblinoids]], and a very few humans who migrated during the 3rd Age. The records speak of the seemingly-ageless Storm Emperor who rules from a floating palace above the clouds and cities housing peoples of gigantic proportions carved out of mountains.

===Nocthian Caldera===
On [[Noefra]], there are two regions with significant Jazuu populations. The first is in the west on the [[Nocthian Caldera]]. Frost giants have been encountered as part of the [[Hungering Frost]], so the Federated Nations believes that a significant populace of jazuu serves the master of that frigid host. Expeditions into the caldera in 211 and 212 AC discovered significant [[jazuu]] populations, as well as scattered true giants. The Night's Children also have no records of a Titanwall (see below) in that area, so how they're creating more (if they are) frost giants is unknown, but it is believed that [[Isskap]] created them in her icy kingdom.

===Giant Spine Mountains===
Main Article: [[Tuura Adam]]

The second (and more well-known) population is in the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] on the north-eastern border of the [[Sea of Grass]]. Here a nation that calls themselves the [[Tuura Adam]] (True People) inhabits the valleys and peaks of this harsh land. Friendly relationships have been maintained with this group, especially between this group and the rulers of [[Zhapai Karmap]] and [[Shinevog]].

==Racial Traits==
Two main groups are present in Noefra--the Tuura Adam in the Giant Spine Mountains and the remnants of those that followed the Hungering Frost in the Nocthian Caldera.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Constitution score increases by 1. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Age'''. Jazuu develop slower than humans and live longer. They are adult by age 20 and live to about 110 years. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Size'''. Your size is Medium, but jazuu are considerably larger than humans. They stand 6’6” to 8’ tall on average and weigh between 250 and 400 pounds. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Speed'''. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Languages'''. You speak Common and Too-til (giantish). &lt;br/&gt;
'''Powerful Build'''. You count as one size larger for determining the weight you can lift, drag, or push and your encumbrance doubles. &lt;br/&gt;
'''High-Mountain Acclimation'''. You are acclimated to high altitudes and cold conditions. &lt;br/&gt;
===Frost-born===
Your ancestors followed (willingly or not) Isskap when she invaded the mortal realm in about 120 AC. Your people have lived in the Nocthian Caldera ever since. Once the Frost was vanquished, your people joined Clan Anu of Wyrmhold, and with them the rest of the Federated Nations. Your people prize physical prowess above all and are unusually tolerant of the cold.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Strength score increases by 2. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Frost tolerance'''. You have resistance to cold damage. &lt;br/&gt;
'''High-mountain Runner'''. You have proficiency in Athletics. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Strength of Mountains'''. Once when you are hit by an attack, you can reduce the damage taken by 1d12 + your Constitution modifier. You regain the use of this trait when you finish a long rest. &lt;br/&gt;

===Tuura Adam===
The people of Tuura Adam live among giants and desire nothing more to undergo the titanwall transformation, becoming one of the large folk. To do this, they train the whole self and compete to be the best possible at their chosen skills. They follow the Code, a written document describing what it means to be perfect, obsessively.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. One ability score of your choice increases by 2.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Tool Master'''. Choose one type of artisans tool. When making a check that allows proficiency in that tool, you can add twice your proficiency bonus instead.&lt;br/&gt;
'''High-Mountain Survivor'''. You have proficiency in Survival.&lt;br/&gt;
'''By the Code'''. Once when you have to make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can instead replace the d20 roll with 10 (and add any modifiers as usual). You must make this choice before you roll. You regain the use of this trait when you finish a long rest.&lt;br/&gt;

      <text bytes="3890" sha1="pyndwk1losqm4uxhe0nb7whzsitkgle" xml:space="preserve">The Tuura Adam are an insular people. According to the [[Immortal Bard]] (who wrote the only treatise on these people), there are two disparate subcultures. The pastoral Koi Ehl follow the sheep in tribes and families, wandering through the high valleys during the summer and returning to the cities during the harsh winters. The cities house the Uruu Ehl, the stationary people. While the Koi Ehl are almost entirely goliaths by race (with an occasional hill giant tagging along), the Uruu Ehl have many more of the other true giants in their midst. The Uruu are by far the more prestigious of the two people; they demand deference from the Koi, who seem to accept them as the rightful masters. The Uruu are organized regionally, with neighborhoods acting as pseudo-tribal organizations (selecting elders, practicing exogamy, etc). Families rarely move between neighborhoods unless they have a major change in standing. 

Both groups are intensely competitive and driven--laziness or complacency is not tolerated. Those who will not work for their living are shunned and exiled. Life is quite orderly and hierarchical--each person knows where they belong and stays there until they can challenge for higher status. The nature of this challenge depends on the occupation of the individuals--craftsmen show off creations, warriors engage in mock combat, sages hold debates. The winner takes (or keeps) the higher status; the loser is relegated to lower ranks. Each craft and each neighborhood has their own hierarchies. This competition extends to the family level--jazuu are recognized as adults when they can overcome the Initiation Trials of their apprenticed trade or craft. Fair play is central to this--everyone must compete by the established rules. Cheating is a serious crime; "innovation" is discouraged.

The set of all rules is compiled in a set of volumes known collectively as "the Code". Memorization of this code is a requirement for Initiation and adulthood. Changes are made only very slowly after much deliberation at all levels. 

Families are centered around the mothers. The fathers may or may not be in the picture, as women rarely bond monogamously. A Tuura woman with 4 children might have had them with 4 different men and be living with a fifth (or with another woman and her family). Mates are chosen primarily based on status, which forms another avenue of competition (both among women for strong Ata, or child-fathers, and among men for the right to have children). The unchosen men live in communal buildings (or tents for the Koi). Strangely, jealousy is not a common vice of the Tuura. Being beaten out for a mate is a sign that one needs to work harder or smarter, not a cause for bitterness. Overall, the Tuura are a very practical, down-to-earth, level-headed people.

The Koi are led by a chief and a council of elders who serve as sages and advisers. There is no gender preference here--men or women can be chosen as chief or elder; the choosing is done by acclimation of the tribe (usually after besting the former chief or elder in a competition of some sort). One primary job of the chief is to keep the records of the tribe. This is done in formal Too-til runes carved into bone. These records include the parentage of every child and the transfiguration of any giants from the tribe, as well as in-marriages and out-marriages and other notable events.

The Uruu (and thus the Koi as well, more tenuously) are led by the cloud giant [[Bulut Boron]] (titled "High Regent"). He rules from the mountain citadel of [[Too Tekterin]] (High Rock) that surmounts and is built into [[Skypiercer Peak]], the highest mountain in the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] as well as the highest point on the continent. Underneath the citadel is the capital city of [[Kozhuyn]], home of the only known full [[Titanwall]] on the [[Noefra]]n continent.

All errors and opinions are his. This work does not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of the [[Society for the Preservation of Antiquities]].

Most people hate and fear the goblins. Green of skin, short of stature, ugly, bestial--these are a few of the epithets hurled at these creatures. Even now, generations after the [[Cataclysm]], they still get blamed for much of the devastation. As I will show, this characterization is unfair. Goblins are a beautiful race with strong desires for civilization.

==Goblins, Hobgoblins, and Bugbears==
Most know that there are three types of creatures commonly found in each tribe. Goblins, the smallest, weakest and most common, are barely the size of a [[halfling]]. Clever with their hands and inventive with traps, they are cowards and will only attack with overwhelming numbers. Hobgoblins form the core of the fighting force. Taller by far than goblins (about the same height as men or even orcs), hobgoblins are tactical leaders of the highest caliber. Their fighting style is organized and disciplined. It reminds me of the best armies from before the Cataclysm. Fortunately hobgoblins are much rarer. A large tribe of several hundred goblins might have ten or fifteen hobgoblins. Strangely enough, the leaders of the tribes are never hobgoblins despite their leadership qualities. The last type of creature is the bugbear. Huge and muscled, only male bugbears seem to exist. They are barely better than animals intellectually--only rarely can they speak in more than broken phrases. They seem to exist only for battle and for heavy labor. They are also quite rare (about half as common as hobgoblins).

The common idea is that these are three related species who have formed somewhat of a symbiotic relationship. The goblins labor and invent, the hobgoblins protect, and the bugbears are living weapons. I have discovered over my time living with various tribes that the truth is somewhat different. There is only one species. Goblins. The belief and needs of the tribe cause young goblins to mutate into the other forms as needed.

For example, I was present for a short-lived war between the Swamp-Gas tribe and a neighboring orc tribe. Before the war started, the Swamp-Gas tribe numbered about 400 individuals, with only 4 bugbears and 20 hobgoblins. Once the orc tribe started moving into the Swamp-Gass' territory and open hostilities broke out, the tribe still numbered about 400. Now, however, there were almost 250 hobgoblins and 50 bugbears. This changed over the space of a few months. I watched the tribe's shamans ritually endow young men (and women!) with charms--within days they were growing tremendously. I didn't sense enough magic for this to be polymorphing spells--the tribe was contributing aether from their own souls to accomplish this transformation. The effect on the remaining goblins was large--they were weak and listless. It seems that the creation and maintenance of the advanced forms puts a strain on the whole tribe. Once the war ended, the surviving hobgoblins reverted to regular goblins within a few months. The intellectual changes reverted as well. Sadly, those chosen to become bugbears did not survive the reversion process. The changes were too extensive. Once the tribe took back their aether, they started falling apart. Literally. Most died within days.

==Goblin Lifecycle==
Goblins are a tribal people. Family is not important--the tribe is. I could find no pattern in their mating habits--no lasting family groups within a tribe. Goblin mothers produce 4-8 children every two years in optimum circumstances. The children are raised by the tribe. Mothers have no unique attachment to their children--they treat all of the tribe's young the same. About 25% of the young die within the first year. Young goblins are brought before the shamans of the tribe after their first year and given names. Those who will become either hobgoblins or bugbears are chosen at this time.

At their tenth year, children are considered adults. Males are traded to other tribes--exogamy is the norm. Only very rarely are male children kept by their home tribe. Hobgoblins and bugbears are never traded.

Even with ample food supplies, goblins don't live very long. The oldest one I have ever met had seen 65 summers.

==Goblin Society==
The tribe is everything to a goblin. There is a sense of individuality, but it is subordinate to the needs of the tribe. They are intensely cooperative within a tribe--almost as if they share a common mind. Information is also shared incredibly quickly. I hypothesize that all goblins of a tribe are linked--they share aether in some way. Asking them about this is futile--they will not (cannot?) say how they know things that no one could have told them. They respond "gRa kaLa" (roughly translated as "I just know").

Tribes range from around 50 to over 500 persons. Small tribes get absorbed (usually peacefully) into larger ones; those too large for their territory hive off into smaller tribes. There does not seem to be any permanent group that controls inter-tribe behavior--squabbles and skirmishes are not rare when tribes compete for resources. Certain tribes have long-standing alliances with other tribes; intermarriage has little or no influence on tribal alliances.

Tribes are mostly nomadic. Some are settled, usually in fertile valleys and near mines. These settled tribes trade with the nomadic ones; very little other trade seems to occur. The nomadic tribes are hunter-gatherers or herders. Since goblins are aggressively omnivorous they can survive even on very poor ground.

Tribes are led by their shaman. This shaman is almost exclusively female. Their magic is akin to that of druids, but I have never seen one take the form of a beast. They intercede with spirits, they conduct divination, they point the tribe to new territories, etc. There doesn't seem to be much in the way of politics--they make decisions within a tribe almost without words and are united once they do.

The male of the [[Strange Couple]] is Fibbon. He was created in a tank in [[Imperial Research Alpha]] out of a gnome pattern--unlike all the other tank-bred gnomes, he developed a personality of his own and a sharp mind, obsessed with mechanisms. He ran the physical plant for 15 years (his entire life), only talking to the evil [[Corran Scalebender]] and the sorrowful [[IULIA]]. As a result, he's naive about the world outside and has severe social deficits. He is a savant with mechanical contraptions, which seem to take on a life of their own when he builds and maintains them. 

He only has two interests in the whole world--Julia and mechanisms. His attitude toward Julia is a combination of reverential worship, lust, and proprietary protectiveness. He will die before he allows her to be harmed. He repairs, maintains, and modifies her body--it is his creation after all. He views other living things as rather pointless, unless they can teach him new techniques or can inspire him to create new mechanical companions (of which he has several at this point).

After decades of wandering with her, they've settled down in [[Crisial of the Four Towers]], where they participate in the scholarly societies and he engineers new devices and she frequents the healing houses.

;Demographics: Fibbon is an albino gnome who wears a clockwork mechanical frame that compensates for his physical weakness. He is totally hairless and circuit-like metallic tattoos can be seen gleaming on his skin. They glow when he's angry or engaged in an act of creation. He's physically only 55 years old, but mentally he's much older. His maturity has not quite caught up, however. He goes everywhere in his warframe with plates of armor strapped to it (functionally has plate armor). He wields a gigantic wrench in both hands in battle, as well as throwing alchemical concoctions to damage and harm his foes. Mechanically he's represented by the stat block below (functionally a 10th level [[Savant]]).

;Personality: Is it threatening Julia? If not, does it have gears and springs? If not, it's not my problem.

;Ideal: Progress. Machines are better than squishy organics.

;Bonds: Julia. She's the only thing that matters to me. All the rest of the world can go burn for all I care, if she survives.

;Flaw: Naivety. Everything I know about the outside world is 800 years old, and I've only ever interacted with a couple of very damaged people.

;Alignment: LE (more lawful than evil).</text>

The existence of gnomes is well-attested in the historical record, but no confirmed sightings have been made since the [[Cataclysm]] 210 years ago (despite rumors of adventurers having seen some in an Old Imperial research facility. After all, everyone knows adventurers make up crazy stories.). Who were gnomes? Where did they come from? Why aren't there any more since the [[Cataclysm]]? Scholars have debated these questions now for centuries.

In this article I will review the current theories on the matter and show why they're wrong. I will then give a definitive account of the matter, settling once and for all the Gnomish Question.

==Current Theories about the Origin and Nature of Gnomes==
Two main (incorrect) theories are prevalent among scholars. We might call these the "mutated dwarves" theory and the "halfling precursor" theory.

===Mutated Dwarves===
The dominant theory is that gnomes were merely a subrace of [[dwarves]], altered by ancient aelvar mages much like [[dragonborn]] were created by the Old Empire. This theory gains strength from the common association of gnomes and dwarves--both were known to favor underground habitats, both are involved in pursuits of smithing and mining and both are small races. They claim the aelvar influence because the gnomes were known to be more inclined to the arcane than dwarves are, which fits an origin with the wizardly aelvar.

This theory tries to account for the forest-dwelling, animal-loving branch of the gnomish race (also well attested) as being merely an aberration, just like the wood elves were an aberrant group of aelvar in the beginning.

Of course this theory is patent nonsense. Dwarves are traditionalists to their core, gnomes were inventors and always trying new things. Furthermore, dwarven records go back for thousands of years and contain no evidence of a gnomish branching. Gnomes are also not prone to runic magic, something characteristic of all branches of genus Tyrannis. It also fails to explain why all of them are gone. So we can safely say that gnomes are not mutated dwarves.

===Halfling Precursors===
An older theory (now superseded) was that halflings are an offshoot of gnomes and that gnomes were the descendants of an otherwise extinct primordial species. As we know know that halflings are descended from proteus multiplex (common [[goblins]]), this theory can be dismissed without further examination.

==The Truth about Gnomes==
Gnomes are, in truth, another branch of ''proteus multiplex''. More specifically, the two sub-races (commonly termed "rock gnomes" and "forest gnomes") are properly named ''proteus multiplex terrae'' and ''proteus multiplex animi'', rock goblins and spirit goblins. They are born in small numbers whenever a goblin tribe is exposed to large quantities of elemental-aspected (especially earth-aspected) anima or to strong influences of the local animal and plant kami. P. multiplex terrae is also susceptible to the fey influence associated with curiosity and inventiveness, resulting in their common image as inventors and mad scientists. This is magnified when many P. multiplex are in a small area, resulting in the spontaneous production of P. multiplex terrae and P. multiplex animi, often at the scale of whole tribes.

Why haven't they shown up since the [[Cataclysm]]? Like most sophonts, P. multiplex populations took a severe beating in the destruction attendant to that event. With their numbers only now approaching normal, there haven't been the critical mass of them needed to create noticeable populations of "gnomes". I fully predict that in the next few decades there will be a resurgence of them especially in [[Wyrmhold]]'s southern region.

;Domain: Mountains. The earth. Patron of the Dwarves. Knowledge, War
;Personality: Mostly quiet with volcanic temper if angered. Does not forget or forgive easily. Strong sense of honor.
;Usual depiction: A larger-than-life hairless, muscled humanoid ([[jazuu]]? Giant?), head bowed and fists pressed together. Usually covered in painted “runes” (usually nonsense) and wearing a loincloth. Usually made out of a dark stone.

;Companions/Demigods: The Lovers (a pair of dwarves),

;Worship: Korokonolkom is dominantly worshiped among the dwarves of the Council. His worship is especially strong in and around Fuar Uulan.

;Traditional dwarves: A deep hole is bored at the base of the statue. Worshipers arrive, write their prayers on pieces of flat slate and silently hand their written prayers to the officiant, who holds them up to the statue and then drops them down the hole. When the hole is filled (which can take decades), a new hole is bored. No words are ever spoken in the shrine. To do so is sacrilege.

;Heretics: There are heretic groups (mostly dwarven but this is spreading to the local human communities as well) that practice tests of endurance including self-flagellation. A worshiper’s status is determined by how long they can go without making a noise or flinching while being subjected to discomfort or pain.

;Religious Precepts: Endure whatever comes. Face it head-on and refuse to bend. Be slow to trust new people or ideas. Remember offenses against self and clan and repay them with interest. Sacrifice self for clan and honor. Honor your written word—lying in writing is a cardinal sin.

;Pre-Divine Stories: Korokonolkom was once one of the ruling [[titans]] and ruler of the Plane of Earth. He dissented from the construction of the [[Orb of All Might]] and the destruction attendant there-to.

      <text bytes="2233" sha1="snz88pk84ct5y2vmyenf4g7y5a1s8av" xml:space="preserve">Created by the ancient Titans before the First Wish sundered the runes, the Orb of All Might has tremendous power. Or at least it did. It is currently split into five parts: the Core and four half-discs--the Discs of Summoning, Binding, Shaping, and Remembering.

==Core of Strength==
The Core, looking much like an apple core, is currently acting as the head of the [[Wyrmhold Regalia|Scepter of Dragon Kings]] in [[Wyrmhold]]. In and of itself, it has very little power, merely acting to strengthen the innate magical strengths of the attuned wielder. When the discs are attached, however, the Core magnifies their power exponentially.

==Disc of Summoning==
This disc's power is focused on pulling power (and beings) between planes. Even a tyro can summon simple elementals; a true runic expert can effortlessly pass between planes or forcibly draw any creature (as well as much raw power) from other planes at will. As with all the discs, what it enables it can also block. Properly used it can prevent the passage of forces between planes over a large area or disrupt portals, even those strongly fortified. Currently, this disc is in the possession of the adventuring group known as The [[Wild Cards]]. 

==Disc of Binding==
This disc's power is to bind and unbind life. A tyro can use it to prevent death or return life to the recently dead; an expert can make create golems and bind souls to artificial bodies without the degradation common to their type. The location of the true Disc of Binding is unknown, although a lesser replica is known to be in possession of the burning [[Khaimal]] dwarves.

==Disc of Shaping==
This disc's power is to transmute the physical elements; to build structures and change landscapes as well as reshape living beings. It's current location is unknown. Recent evidence places it (inconclusively) in the possession of the the [[Demon Princes|Demon Prince]] known as the [[Twisted]].

==Disc of Remembering==
This disc's power is to shape souls and memories. The wielder can produce or erase memories, brainwash people into complete fanaticism or turn them into sleeper agents. It was last in possession of [[Isskap]], Titan of Frost, but went missing after her fall.

;Location: At the intersection of two minor rivers in the south-central area of Byssia.
;Defenses: Very little. A few dozen monk-guards and various sages. Posses of citizens can be called up if needed. No wall.
;Economics: Light manufacturing, especially cotton textiles. A market has grown up for the packaging of dyes from the islands for shipment elsewhere.
;Leadership: The High Court, composed of
* Arch Druid Damon Dreamcat--male wood elf. Middle-aged Druid (Circle of the Moon). Prefers the shape of large cats. Tends to speak cryptically.
* High Sage Savvas Stonemaster--female human. Older Elemental Sage (Outward Spiral). Prefers earth elementals, is not pretty (very solid and blocky like her servants). Brusque.
* High Judge Danai the Just--female half-elf. Currently serving as Presiding High Judge. New to that position and young. Does not tolerate flippancy. Think Judge Judy, but young and relatively pretty.

      <text bytes="1902" sha1="44nwe1cjgf69598cieclt0cawqbe4zc" xml:space="preserve">Iseis pe Kel'al'ar was born a commoner in the Southern District capital of [[Kel'al'ar]] (now capital of the Serpent Dominion). He joined the city watch in the upheaval following the [[Dark Lady]]'s demise in 205 AC and quickly rose to the rank of Lieutenant Investigator. Growing restless with the political infighting and becoming frustrated with noble interference in his duties, he left the force when he was recruited by the Adventurer's Guild in 209. He and [[Quickleaf]] were assigned to handle the [[Godsfall]] matter. His knowledge of politics and diplomacy served him well there--he was instrumental in the formation of the Alliance and personally conducted many of the negotiations required to get that fractious bunch to cooperate.

He gained the ability to slip through solid matter (a Boon of Questionable Solidity), the trust of all of the local groups, and the Divine Champion armor set that predates the Cataclysm. After the death of [[Kul'Asad]] and the ascension of the [[Archon of Time]], he spent the winter in [[Godsfall]] helping to coordinate and stabilize the nascent government. In early spring of 211, he left Godsfall for parts unknown.

;Demographic Information: Iseis is a late 60s human (scale-kin) male. Thoroughly average in appearance, other than his alabaster-and-gold armor and glowing sword (all it does is glow), he prefers to find alternate routes and makes elaborate plans. Actually hitting things with his sword is rather secondary. Mechanically, he's a level 9 human Battlemaster, wielding a moontouched blade and wearing plate armor.
;Personality Trait: I never think in straight lines.
;Ideal: Diplomacy is a first, second, and preferred approach to every problem.
;Bond: I solve problems. Don't get in my way.
;Flaw: Twisty thoughts often cause needless complications.
;Alignment: Chaotic Good

      <comment>/* The Congregation (the 16 true gods) */</comment>
      <origin>2388</origin>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text bytes="10706" sha1="qkb5lji6vxq1v2wmwtyxg16bzi737lz" xml:space="preserve">There are several sources of power for those that believe. Gods, fiends, elemental princes, kami, and ascended heroes are the most common.

==The Congregation (the 16 true gods)==
Gods (members of the [[Congregation]]) are beings directly tied in to the [[Great Mechanism]]. Each one started as a lesser being (many were mortals, others were elemental beings) chosen and empowered as a consequence of the [[Ages of the World|3rd Wish]], these beings have near-limitless power in their domains and cannot be destroyed as long as they are fulfilling their role. Unlike ascendants, their power is independent of the number or quality of their worshipers; as a result they are generally less concerned with the details of the worship of their faithful. Their duty is to answer (or at least hear) prayers and to represent their domains and keep them in order. They are also tightly regulated in their exercise of this power and cannot act directly without risk. They act through [[demigods]] and clerics--the first are former mortals chosen and called up and empowered by the god to act in their name; the second are still-living mortals granted access to a tiny sliver of the power delegated to their god based on their faith and connection to their deity and his or her domains. 

A short description of each of the 16 Congregants follows; more detail can be found on their individual pages. Domains in italics are the generic domains most commonly focused on with clerics of each deity. These do not constitute an exhaustive list. The gods are worshipped world-wide, but the listed areas have especial focus on some of them.

*[[Aerielara]], The Jeweled Lady
**Domain: Lust. Sexuality. Beauty. Art/Music. ''Life, Trickery''
**Personality: Vain. The musician of the Gods. Beautiful and sensual. Deceptively intelligent.

* [[Hollow King]], The Executioner
** Domain: Untimely death, murder, maintenance of order at any cost. Patron of assassins. ''Death, Trickery''

==[[Ascended heroes|Ascended Heroes]]==
Mortals who gathered enough ongoing fame and veneration while alive, the ascended heroes are much weaker than the Congregation and much more dependent on their worshipers. To a degree, they are shaped by this worship--as their worshipers believe, so they become. This means that they are much more diligent about shaping the religious practices of their followers. What they lack in power (being not much more powerful on average than the strongest mortal) they make up for in ability to intervene. Unlike the gods, they cannot ordain clerics; they pass on secrets to their followers and bind them to pacts instead.

Below are listed a few of the prominent ones in western [[Noefra]]. There are many others.

* The [[Queen Ascendant]]
** History: A mortal elf used as a conduit for a demonic ritual siphoning souls for a thousand years. Ascended after being freed from the ritual chains by the [[Catalysts]].
** Worshiped in: the [[Jungle of Fangs]].
** Ethos: Maintain the order of the nations. Each person should know their place and strive to magnify it. Self-sacrifice in a noble cause is the noblest choice.

* [[Nocthis]]
** History: Once a god herself before the [[Cataclysm]], she was protected from the absorption of the [[Old Gods]] by a ritual performed by some of her followers. The ritual was completed by adventurers in 211 AC and she was reborn and ascended as a hero.
** Worshiped in: [[Byssia]] (very heavily)
** Ethos: Preserve secrets, especially magical ones. Hallow the night. Women should rule. Keep to the old traditions.

==Fiends==
Worship and service to other extra-planar (astral or abyssal) entities is a quick, but risky, source of power.
===Devils===
One can pledge himself to the Dons of the Infernal Hierarchy, signing binding contracts. Contrary to popular belief, this does not involve signing away ones' soul or promising to do horrific acts of evil. Devils don't want your soul--that's the province of demons. Instead, they want an ongoing portion of the excess energy created by your soul. For most, this isn't much. Enough to gain you a spell or so or a single act of help from a devil. For those with powerful souls, they can learn to call on the more powerful beings, gaining knowledge and excercising power. All at a cost--the power warps the wielder's soul, often causing a loss of empathy and understanding for ones fellows, as well as diminished creativity and stunted growth (physical and spiritual). For that "excess" energy is what allows one to learn and grow.

See [[Diabolical_Families|Diabolical Families]] for more specifics about the families and their goals.
===Demons===
Demons, the residents of the [[Abyss]], are those that survive on stolen and caged souls. This gives them great power, but taints their essence and makes them anathema to creation itself. Their very presence on the mortal plane corrupts it and degrades its fabric. Those that sacrifice to demons (often involving [[blood Magic|blood magic]]) find that they too become warped and tainted; after death their souls become fuel for the demons unless they're very lucky or powerful. Demon worship arises from desperation, madness, or an overwhelming lust for power or dark secrets. Worship of demons is considered a capital crime in all of the [[Federated Nations]] and surrounding territories. Those credibly accused are to be slain without trial or chance of forgiveness--their souls are already forfeit.

See [[Demon Princes]] for more information about specific demon lords. Others exist, but they are of significantly lesser might and influence.

==Elemental Princes==
One can gain power by devoting oneself to one of the lords of an elemental plane. Powerful [[genie]]s, dragons, and other beings can grant power. Their demands are varied, and the power they give is that of a warlock--empowered by secrets taught and rituals learned through contracts--rather than that of a cleric.

      <text bytes="3853" sha1="62aimg63zvw8w3jt3181ulavgquz96b" xml:space="preserve">The Federated Nations Council (short form: Federated Nations or FNC) is an international organization formed in western [[Noefra]] to handle international relationships, trade negotiations, and peace-keeping efforts among the signatory states.

==History==
===Founding through Crystal Spire War===
Founded in 206 AC through the efforts of the [[Catalysts]], the original FNC consisted of the following nations:
* the [[Council Lands]],
* [[Wyrmhold]] (then called the Remnant Dynasty),
* [[Byssia]],
* the [[Windwalker Confederacy]],
* and the [[Stone Throne]].

It mostly handled trade matters as well as was the chartering organization for the [[Adventurer’s Guild]]. Centered at [[Fort Hope]], it also controls the [[Portal Network]].

Until the [[Crystal Spire War]] of 217 AC, the FNC was mostly passive, serving as a mutual contact point. Interactions between nations were sparse and nations mostly focused on their own concerns; the council stayed out of internal affairs entirely. Trade happened through the portals and was only beginning to happen over land. 

One of the first tasks the Council undertook was to standardize the international reference [[coinage]], a decision that has lasted until this day. All prices and values are conventionally quoted in terms of these Council Marks, patterned after the coinage system used in the [[Council Lands]] at the time. Individual nations may follow this to a greater or lesser degree, but all international trade, as well as foreign and ancient coinage is valued in terms of Council Marks. 

===Crystal Spire War to present===
The events of the [[Crystal Spire War]] changed that calculus. The intervention of [[Adventurer’s Guild]] operatives in what some parties were calling "suppressing rebellion" and others "oppression" set a precedent. Specifically, the Guild and the powerful adventurers (and their allies) would not tolerate inter-member (or even infra-member) hostilities. The council has mediated the difficulties between [[Byssia]] and [[Wyrmhold]] in the [[Nocthian Caldera]], handled the breakup of the [[Stone Throne]] into the three nations that now form that region, and the dissolution of the [[Council Lands]] into the [[Successor States]] (with only limited success at preventing bloodshed) and watched over the growing trade and interconnections between nations.

In the summer of 251 AC, [[Auringon]] applied for membership in the Council system.

== Current Concerns ==

* Tensions (again) between [[Byssia]] and [[Wyrmhold]], this time in the [[Tri-nation Border]] region near the [[Blood-thirst Wildlands]]. These flared in the summer of 251 AC, but are currently on the ebb due to adventurer interference.
* Handling the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]] and its grabbiness and difficulties with its neighbors [Future note: at the end of 251 AC, the change in the divine status of [[Loran Hae]] causes the HKR to retreat inward and turn away outsiders other than at border enclaves].
* Relations with the east, via the newly-reopened (summer 251) [[Shaadval]] portal.
* Increased secessionist sentiment in the orc-dominated [[Fiach Wood]] of [[Wyrmhold]].
* Expansion of various nations into the [[Blood-thirst Wildlands]], causing difficulties with the existing residents.
* Handling contact with the [[Goroesi]] of [[Moon's Vengeance]], opened by [[Enigma]].
* Growing dissatisfaction in many parts at the heavy-handed control exerted by the [[Adventurer’s Guild]] via the [[Crystal Spire Protocols]] as well as their monopoly on the [[Portal Network]] nodes.
* Working toward greater integration with nations in [[Soefra]], both those of the [[Great Rift]] as well as the [[Phoenix Empire]] of central [[Soefra]].
* Internal strife within the First Expeditionary Fleet of the [[Ship Folk]] and on [[Sentinel Island]].

      <text bytes="2150" sha1="c3baf5lsb6anw3wjymogsizxr97cxml" xml:space="preserve">====Other Names====
Mistress of Storms, Storm Serpent, Pitiless One.
====Domain====
Oceans. Cold. Storms. ''Nature, Tempest''
====Personality====
Changeable, with a temper. No pity for the weak. Not particularly subtle.

====Usual Depiction====
A serpentine dragon/sea serpent, scales glitter metallic blue-grey. When painted, she is usually depicted rising from the sea in the middle of a storm.

====Companions/Demigods====
[[Perkunos]] and [[Tatsuryuu]]

====Worship in Western Noefra====
Not worshiped, only propitiated. Propitiated during storm season in the Stone Throne. Feared and hated in [[Wyrmhold]], where they talk of “a serpent up the back” for a bad feeling or curse with “Sele’s shed scales.” This causes much friction with Stone Throne dwellers. Propitiated with blood sacrifice, and not token. Always an animal, preferably a predator.

=====Religious Precepts=====
The ocean is inscrutable. Do not advertise your plans. The chill of the ice is implacable. Keep pressing forward until you have ground your enemies underfoot. All men are equal before the storm. No inherent respect for tradition or authority.

==== Worship in Other Areas====

* [[Ikela]]: Considered the pre-eminent deity by the [[Ikelan Religion|Stormqueen's Wake]] cult. Worshiped heavily throughout the area. Oddly, she's seen as much more approachable there, where she's known as the "World-serpent" or the "Storm Queen", worshiped mainly as a goddess governing ''weather'', including the seasonal rains on which the agriculture depends.
* [[Ship Folk]]: She is the Divine One, seen as THE goddess for the ship folk. But it is not a relationship of love--rather it's one of fear and emulation. They seek to be just as cold and merciless and strong as she is. The Wave Priests of the Fleets wield her wrath (or so they say) on all that oppose the Fleets.&lt;br /&gt;

====Pre-Divine Status====
Selesurala was [[Tatsuryuu]]'s child and regent of the Plane of Water before the [[Cataclysm]]. Neutral during the [[Titan-Wyrm War|Titan-Wyrm Wars]], she apotheosized relatively early. She did ''not'' appreciate being "promoted" to divine rank.

      <text bytes="7166" sha1="qzmv1666kltencc8isym63qwebk95g0" xml:space="preserve">The Stone Throne was a nation that existed from approximately 300 BC until 245 AC. Founded after the [[Gwerin|gwerin]] rulers of the ancient [[Fanged Kingdom]] disappeared for parts unknown, the Stone Throne was the sole power in the [[Jungle of Fangs]].

==History==
===Founding - Cataclysm===
The Stone Throne was the successor state to the [[Fanged Kingdom]] after the masters of that mageocracy disappeared for parts unknown in approximately 550 BC.

Ruled by the [[Fang-kin Culture|Isal caste]] as the chosen descendants of the masters under the watchful eye of the priest-bureaucracy answering to the [[Queen Ascendant]], the center of the ancient Stone Throne was in the central and southern areas from [[Ar Salem Dolem]] down to [[Kel'al'ar]] and especially around [[Lake Thom]].

Not much is known about those days outside of [[Ar Salem Dolem]], as the priest-bureaucrats are loath to share information. What is known is that ruins have been found all over the [[Jungle of Fangs]], depicting a complex, highly devout culture. There are hints that the caste system was not nearly as pronounced as it later became, and especially that the [[Ophidian]]s were not the reviled and mistreated undercaste that they became later.

===Cataclysm - Liberation ===
At the [[Cataclysm]], the survivors of the Stone Throne retreated south to [[Kel'al'ar]] due to sudden increases in hostility from the wildlife in the central and northern areas. During the next 50 years, the traditional religion and caste system weakened; the religious beliefs were only kept alive due to the faithful preaching and obedience of the [[ophidian]] people. 

Approximately two generations later, a group of settlers under the leadership of [[Hvang Ssa'ka]] rediscovered the holy city of [[Ar Salem Dolem]], with the few remaining priest bureaucrats and the eternal [[Queen Ascendant]]. They founded [[Asai'ka (City)]] and revitalized the religious life.

At this point the caste system hardened into the system that lasted until the downfall of the [[Stone Throne]], and the religious texts were edited to remove any mention of the role of the [[ophidian]]s in keeping the religion alive during the dark times in the south. Instead, they were taught to pity and fear the snake-changed, especially in the southern regions.

By 150 AC, the Central and Southern Districts were functioning normally. Leadership of the Central District had been in the hands of Isal [[Hvang Ssa'ka]], who had somehow prolonged his life beyond that of normal fang-kin, the entire time. The Southern District had a more tumultuous history, with dynastic turnover every few generations.

Starting in about 180 AC, the Northern District began to be settled slowly, starting with the fort-turned-city of [[Sha'slar]].

From roughly 193 AC, the priest-bureaucrats under High Priestess Asa'lor began re-emphasizing the sacrificial rites. Over the next decade, they grew to include ritual sacrifice of dissidents, children, and other mortals on a regular cadence, not just at the high festivals every few years. All of this in service to the ancient demonic pact (see [[Queen Ascendant]] for more details). By 205 AC, these hideous rituals were conducted weekly, and the culture had grown to revel in the blood and degradation. Male sacrifices were often castrated and otherwise tortured as part of the ceremony, while women were raped repeatedly. Children were merely butchered, often flayed alive.

== Leadership (205 - 245 AC) ==
====Sal'zar, the Queen's Fang====
After the [[Ascension of the Serpent Queen]] in early 206 AC, the former lord of the Northern District, Isal [[Prei Sal'zar]], has assumed the role of Queen's Fang (king in all but name). He rules from beside the Stone Throne and, along with his wife, the High Priestess [[Laila'ssa]], has reduced the bureaucracy to a minimum. Most of the ranking members of the priestly caste are new since the end of demonic worship in 204 AC and the Ascension (along with the purge that followed). Sal'zar's rule is harsh but fair. Members of the aristocratic and priestly castes pay for their expanded privileges with stricter rules of conduct and greater penalties for failure. Sal'zar is loved by the common people, especially in the Northern District.

He wears nothing but white, the color of shed snake-skin, the color of mourning. The rumor is that he is in perpetual mourning for his Queen, whom he loved more personally than religiously.

He passed away in 238 AC, precipitating the crisis that broke up the Stone Throne.

====Lalia'ssa, the Queen's Tongue====
Sal'zar's wife is the High Priestess of the [[Queen Ascendant]]. She was a former handmaiden to the Queen and is devoted to carrying out her vision for her people. She has spent the last five years reforming the religious life of the nation--converting the worship from blood sacrifice and perversions to a more symbolic and heart-felt worship of the Queen and the other gods of the Congregation.

Sal'zar and Lalia'ssa have a good working relationship and three children, but it is a well known fact that their marriage is one of convenience and politics, not love. Lalia'ssa has several open lovers; Sal'zar is mostly celibate.

====Ssak'ka AKA "Dream-Lord"====
Isal [[Hvang Ssa'ka]] ruled from the oldest of the three non-capital cities, Asai'ka in the Central District of the Stone Throne until the breakup of that nation in 245. He is an ancient half-elf, the oldest mortal being in the Stone Throne. As of 210 AC, he has been the ruler of this district since the Stone Throne came into being 130 years ago. The source of his long life is unknown, although he is known to be an alchemist of the highest caliber. He is known to be extremely unpredictable and quite possibly insane. He spends almost all his time in his tower laboratory. Those who displease him often disappear--rumor has it that they are taken to the tower and experimented on. He is a widower with two young children (other than those that are grown and gone). Since the death of his wife, Lady [[Kinlanna]] in the liberation of the Stone Throne from demonic worship, he has settled down and is making more attempts to govern his people sensibly. His behavior is still erratic and his temper is feared throughout the land.

The people of the district (especially [[Asai'ka]]) still venerate the name of Kinlanna--shrines to her have started popping up in corners. The priestly caste claims that she has not ascended--in fact, no evidence of her can be found.

After the breakup of the Stone Throne, he disappeared into "retirement", although most believe he died.

====Lai Chea General-a====
[[Chea General-a]] handled the day-to-day business of the Northern District. A hard, proud half-elf of about 45 years, she served under Fang Sal'zar from early in the Northern District's history. She cares a lot for order and is somewhat of a conservative socially.

      <text bytes="6040" sha1="ckbp2am04otzujvip9oovxpugkuxvy0" xml:space="preserve">Ice, the combination of water and air, with water dominant. Corresponds to the month of Winter Dawning (roughly December). Aspected to memory, for good or for ill.

==History==
Originally part of the [[Plane of Water]] before the [[planar realignment]] at the [[Cataclysm]].

===Rulers===
As part of the [[Plane of Water]], it was originally ruled over by [[Tatsuryuu]] until her cursing by the [[Titan Conclave]] during the [[Ages of the World|First Age]]. Her daughter, [[Selesurala]], took charge of the plane until the [[planar realignment]], when she was involuntarily exalted to godhood. Her lieutenant [[Isskap]] took command of the portion that became the Plane of Ice, and ruled it until overthrown by a combined force of mortals (the [[Wild Cards]]) and planar beings. The resulting power vacuum has not been filled to this date--the ice palace [[Kek]] still remains empty and cursed.

=== Current Factions (252 AC) ===
As of this writing, there are three significant factions vying for the rulership of the Plane, although none have found the [[Glacierheart]], the object encapsulating the core of the [[True Word]] that is the plane, which means that none can truly win. The [[Angels]] of the Second Legion, Third Host maintain an active patrol, breaking up any open warfare between the factions, at least in the [[Valley of Memory]].

==== Remnant of the Armies of the Hungering Frost ====
Led by the behemoth frost giant general _________ (fill in name when I remember it...), this faction has the most martial presence. It is composed of frost-born giants, giant-kin, and goblins, along with a small amount of enslaved or impressed monsters numbering nearly 200,000. It holds the north-eastern Valley and the glacial slopes beyond. It is allied with/indebted to the [[Plane of Coal]] and receives material support from those grasping merchants and engineers. Hierarchical in nature, its leadership is based on physical strength, which is both a strength and a weakness. If the general were to fall, he would simply be replaced by another--decapitation would have little effect. Due to the constant struggles for power among its leaders, however, it lacks the unity of focus to crush the other factions, although it certainly has the manpower and military strength to do so (at least if the angels didn't interfere). Were it to take control of the plane, it would likely start another invasion of the [[Mortal Plane]] as its hero, [[Isskap]] did. Not in the same place or for the same aims--this one would pour out of the high mountains ''somewhere'' and seek to conquer and control.

==== Grudge-bound Coven ====
The least numerous, but most unified and magically-powerful faction is led by three ancient witches/frost-bound [[hags]], known only as the Maiden, Mother, and Crone. They long-ago gave up their bond to the [[Mother Tree]] in favor of the Name of Ice, but this has only reinforced their hatred and desire to repay debts and slights...old, new, imagined, real, it doesn't matter. Once subject to [[Isskap]]'s dominion, they betrayed her when the [[Wild Cards]] offered them freedom in exchange for allowing them through the inner defenses. They thought that this would give them control of [[Kek]] and thus of the plane...but the frost titan hid the [[Glacierheart]] somewhere else, and the curse on the palace kept them from fully exploring it. Instead, they've sought for worship in the [[Mortal Plane]], becoming the Threefold Voice, deity worshiped by the [[Jaruud]] of the [[Nocthian Caldera]] as well as others. On the plane of Ice, they have focused on building up information networks, including spies, agents, and assassins. The faction's numbers are small, only a few thousand, focused almost entirely in the [[Valley of Memory]], but they command many elemental forces and most of the strong mages, witches, shamans, and other such beings. Their objectives are unclear, but it is clear that if they were in power, they would carry on a reign of terror and oppression, manipulating father against brother; poisoning the minds of those that would oppose them. They act in a unified fashion, but only because the Coven itself pulls the strings. Were they removed, the faction would likely disintegrate...messily.

==== Common Folk ====
The third, extremely disorganized faction is notionally the largest in pure numbers. It encompasses nearly all the common folk, frost-born and frost-bound and mortal alike, as well as nearly all of the Spoken monsters (including the frost wolves and wargs). It has selected as its reluctant champion [[Fenrir]], mother of wolves, but she is in no sense their leader, having refused that role. They have no common cause other than preventing either of the other two factions from taking control.

==Geography==
Glacier-covered mountains and endless ice fields surround small habitable (to mortals) valleys of tundra, moor, and bog. These valleys are mostly near the border with the [[Plane of Ocean]]. As one approaches the border with the [[Plane of Cloud]], ice storms and blizzards become almost continuous--very little lives here other than [[ice elementals]] and [[mephits]] of various types. At the other border, with the [[Plane of Ocean]], the mountains give way to floating ice sheets, breaking into icebergs and pack ice as one crosses over.

Approaching the [[Crystal Sphere]] means moving into the endless dark and cold. The mountains give way to a flat plain of ice; the light of [[Eua]] dims, and even the storms cease. Eventually, even the ice gives way to empty space. Going the other direction, toward [[Eua]], is entering elemental chaos. Once you approach the orbit of [[Primus]], the elements are so jumbled as to present no consistent pattern. This is the most hostile area--strange super-heated ice elementals, blazing storms of ice and fire and rock--these are everyday near [[Eua]].

===Places===
* [[Valley of Memory]]
* The [[Diamond Fields]]
* The [[Hall of Frozen Memory]]
* [[Kek]]
* [[Estokh]]
* The [[Grinding]]

==Notable Places==
[[Hall of Frozen Memory]] (AKA Hall of Living Memory or Hall of Grudges)--a labyrinthine tunnel/cave filled with frozen memory crystals. Touching one lets you relive the memory. Where do they come from? No one knows. Destruction or damage is BAD.

[[Estokh]]--the capital of the [[Plane of Ice]]. About 30,000 inhabitants, on the edge of the Drear Fens. Most cosmopolitan area of the [[Plane of Ice]], a broad mix of peoples and beings.

[[Third Host, 2nd Legion Headquarters]]--the dwelling place and central command for 3.2. Roughly half of that legion are centered here; the rest are split between the other two water-dominant planes. Much of the forces here in Ice are scattered throughout, as this has always been a restive area.

[[Kek]], Palace of Ice--[[Isskap]]'s palace, with its surrounding ring forts. Abandoned and never re-claimed after her destruction due to strong [[Broken Concept]] distortions present there.

;Meaning: Wild Hold

Established in the ruins of [[Alkh-Hold]] after it was reclaimed by the [[Wild Cards]] from [[mkhulu]] control in 211 AC, Zhapai Karmap is the newest member of the Federated Nations region. Dedicated to freedom, the Wild Hold is one of the most racially-diverse areas in [[Noefra]]. It is also one of the smallest, claiming only about 100 sq miles in the Alkh Valley in the [[Giant Spine Mountains]], although the Abandoned city of Dominance (after its liberation) acts as a protectorate. With a total population (as of 250 AC) of only 15,033 in the Alkh Valley itself, it is small but powerful.

The Wild Hold only accepted the [[Crystal Spire Protocols]] provisionally, and is considered somewhat of a rogue state by many others (especially the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]]). Very few laws govern behavior--basically don't steal, don't hurt people, don't get caught cheating. Violations are harshly punished, with the death penalty being common and torture for lesser offenses. Many substances considered contraband elsewhere are allowed and even encouraged, as long as you don't get in trouble while using them. ZK has a good relationship with the Abandoned clans, holding military maneuvers (more like semi-organized brawls) every year on the border--a coliseum has been built there to house these fights.
[[File:Alkh-valley.webp|thumb|800x800px|Alkh Valley, AKA Zhapai Karmap ca 250 AC]]

==Ruler==
[[Thon Mountain-break]] rules the nation, as much as anyone rules a group as fractious and wild as they are. Basically he just smites those that get out of line, if his fellows don't catch them first.

==Other Notable People==
[[Helwyr]] runs the First National Bank of ZK, which now has branches throughout Western Noefra. Known for being merciless against anyone who tries to rob it, it's considered the safest place to store money and much international trade is done using promissory notes drawn on the bank.

[[Oopsie]] runs the drug trade, when he's not indulging in the product himself. Their major customers are the nobles of [[Dreamshore]], but their products make their way all across the continent.

[[Uririel Sunia]] serves as the chief general, as well as works toward becoming more draconic. He's working with [[Imperial Legacy]] agents, and has been rumored to even be working with members of the proscribed (everywhere else, that is) [[Imperial Sons]]. In between wars and adventures, he keeps himself busy as the nation's excecutioner.

==Registered Company==
The only company registered in ZK is [[Delicate Apocalypse]], a goblin-run group that specializes in weapon research. Especially weapons that go boom. And anything else that explodes, catches on fire, catches other people on fire, makes loud noises, or is otherwise...fun.

==Demographics==
A total mix:
* Dwarves from the Abandoned Clans
* Humans
* Puun ihmisia
* remnants of the [[cysgoroesi]] from [[Creche Skeud]]
* a few dozen Shadesteel Guardians, also from [[Creche Skeud]]
* shifters and free weres
* goliaths that didn't fit in with the [[Tuura Adam]]
* and a flock of other strange people from all over the place. Doesn't matter what you did out there, as long as you don't screw up here you'll have a place.

The Sun. Honorable Warfare. ''Light, War''

==== Personality ====
Stodgy. No sense of humor. Bitter enemy of the [[Red Fang]].

==== Other Names ====
Sun-Lord, Lord of Battle

==== Usual Depiction ====
a humanoid figure in full, plain plate armor with a full helm that hides the face. He bears a heater shield with a full sun (golden) on a white field and a simple cross-hilted long sword, point down.

==== Companions/Demigods ====
The [[Shield-maiden]], the [[Youth]], the [[Squire]]

==== Worship in Western Noefra ====
Worshiped as the head of the [[Seasonal Four]] by wall-builders, heavily worshiped in [[Wyrmhold]]. His clergy are the militia heads in the villages and lead in training exercises. They often take the role of administrators. They wear armor whenever possible and are always armed. Offerings are deeds—heads of threatening beasts, weapons taken from foes, etc. His festivals usually involve ritual combat. Unlike [[Roel Kor]]’s combats, surrendering is considered bad form, as is any kind of underhanded tactics. Wrestling, running races, and other athletic contests are very common. “The sun sees all” is an admonition to do one’s duty honestly.

The [[jazuu]] also worship the sun lord, but focus more on being the best at whatever their task is. Competition of all forms, not just physical competition. The emphasis on duty and honor and honesty are the same.

===== Religious Precepts =====
Be loyal to those in authority; those in authority must consider carefully their duty. Meet the enemy head on to prove your faith. Be willing to die before letting the weak suffer. Never betray an oath; live with honor even in the face of deceit. Smite the foe that that threatens your people.

==== Worship in Other Areas ====

* [[Ikela]]: Part of the pantheon worshiped by the [[Ikelan Religion|CCU]]. Most heavily individually worshiped by members of the military.

==== Pre-divine Status ====
[[Tor-Elan]] was the son of [[Loran Hae]] and [[Melara]]. He was a paladin serving [[Old Gods|Pelear]]. Together with [[Sakara]], his wife, they served at the [[Battle of Acceptance]] where they fell in the last push before the [[Cataclysm]].

The Red Knight, Patron of Kings, Strategist of the Gods

==== Domain ====
Tyranny, Control. Power. ''War, Order''

==== Personality ====
Micromanages. Opposes [[Pinwheel]] strongly. Not particularly concerned about collateral damage.

==== Usual Depiction ====
A male high elf, wearing red-painted, ornately-decorated plate armor and wearing a crown. He wields a two-handed mace. A multi-colored snake is wrapped around his shoulders, head out with fangs displayed.

==== Companions/Demigods ====
[[Ssss’al]], the Serpent.

==== Worship in Western Noefra ====
Not often worshiped among wall-builders, although the elitists (especially in the [[Crisial Kingdom]] and the [[Duarchy of Kotimaa]]) certainly venerate him. Tied with the [[Aerielara|Jeweled Lady]] for worship among the nations of the [[Jungle of Fangs]], especially among the upper classes and military. Combat (physical and intellectual) competitions are common. Playing dragon-chess is a common replacement for actual violent combat. His worship is the most ritualistic, with many exacting rules and status-dependent rites—commoners and nobles worship at different times and in different ways. Many offerings are token blood offerings, preferably shed in combat. Surrender in ritual combat is allowed and encouraged if over-matched. Know your place and all that.

====== Religious Precepts ======
The strong rightfully dominate the weak, by force if necessary. Order is only possible through strict hierarchy. Those that can act, should. Violence is necessary to get one’s way. Might is right. In exchange for protection, the weak should honor and respect the strong.

==== Worship in Other Areas ====

* Ikela: Worshiped as one of the primary gods, especially by nobles.

==== Politics ====
Strongly progressive, but opposes both [[Lon-Ka]] and the [[Seasonal Four]]. He chafes at the restrictions on divinities.

==== Pre-divine History ====
He is believed to have been a resident of the former [[Stone Throne]] pre-[[Cataclysm]]. Not much is authentically known.

the Fox, Trickster, Deceiver, the Mocker

==== Usual depiction ====
Varies wildly. Most frequently a short, hooded, [[dragonborn]] figure wearing a domino mask with a crow on his shoulder.

==== Companions/Demigods ====
The only demigod associated with Pinwheel is his crow, Akaa. This creature is reputed to be capable of speech, but only in a mocking imitation of human voices. Any messages it passes on are distorted, usually so as to cause humorous misunderstandings or to puncture the pride of the self-righteous or haughty. “Speaking with a crow’s tongue” is a common expression for twisting words or sarcastic mockery.

==== Worship in Western Noefra ====
Organized worship of Pinwheel is rare and concentrated among comedic entertainers, actors, and politicians. The Judicial branch of the Council’s [[Thieves' Guild]] was said to balance worship of Pinwheel with worship of [[Ytra]]. There is a small shrine (with about 10 acolytes) to Pinwheel outside of [[Rauviz]]. All visitors are blindfolded during the approach. Practical jokes are played on them as a test.

===== Religious Precepts =====
Disturb the comfortable, humble the haughty. Adapt to change. Never tell all the truth, unless that’s the most deceptive thing you can say. Constantly test those that seem complacent (with practical jokes). Only hurt those that oppress others.

==== Worship in other areas ====

* Ikela: Very minor deity among the [[Ikelan Religion|CCU]], mainly in his aspect as the Deceiver. The Stormqueen's Wake sees him as an ally in their fight against established power structures.

==== Political Affiliation ====
Dutiful. He actually takes this position quite seriously, which is rather strange. Many of those acquainted with [[Astral]] politics believe this to be some form of extremely extended con or joke.

==== Domain ====
Deception, trickery. ''Trickery, Life''

==== Personality ====
The trickster of the Congregation. Not given to evil acts, but also not to good acts. Hates tyranny and compulsion. Can't stand people taking themselves seriously.

The Evenhanded, Scale-bearer, Lady Justice

====Domain====
Justice, Law. ''Light, Order''

====Personality ====
Absolutely no sense of humor or mercy. Does not participate in most of the schemes of the gods. Acts as the enforcer for the [[Great Mechanism]].

====Usual Depiction====
A neuter figure, indeterminate race. Close-cropped hair. Wears a mask with no eye holes. It carries a set of pan scales in one hand—on one side is a stylized heart, on the other a set of weights. The other hand carries a double-edged sword, point upward.

====Companions/Demigods ====
None

====Worship in Western Noefra====
Worshiped primarily as Final Judge among wall-builders; her (the conventional pronoun, despite the indeterminate gender) clergy (among which are many paladins) are all combatants and inquisitors. The common people rarely worship her ''per se'', seeing her as harsh and implacable. Her high priestess is the court of final appeal—any citizen can appeal to the Scales for judgement. This is rarely done, as what follows will be just with no regard for mercy. Swearing by the Scales and Sword is the strongest oath known to wall-builders or [[dragonborn]]; falsely swearing this oath is a mortal sin and usually results in death if discovered.
=====Religious Precepts=====
Let justice be done, though the heavens fall. Respect not the man of power. Tell no lies. This includes lies of omission. Smite those that step away from the righteous path. There are no minor sins.

====Worship in Other Places====

* [[Ikela]]: She is worshipped as part of the [[Ikelan Religion|Church of the Congregation, United]] as the patron of the Magistrata (the collective society of judges), mainly by the Evenhanded title. Many appeal to her for relief from tormentors or injustice. Additionally, there are several (small) orders of warriors, vigilantes, and oath-sworn who consider her their patron. Thieves and criminals routinely take her name in vain ("By the Broken Scales!" or "May the scales tip my way"). 

====Pre-divine Status====
Unknown. Including race and gender, although she is mostly referred to in the feminine, at least in Western [[Noefra]]. Some scholars believe that she was a human who had previously apotheosized and joined the [[Angels|Angelic Legions]] before being tapped for deity status.

Untimely death, murder. Patron of assassins. ''Death, Trickery''
====Personality====
Dour and cruel, but fair. A firm believer in law and order for the masses. Also believes that some need to stand in the shadows to enforce that law.

====Other Names====
Patron of Assassins, Lord of the Knife, Death's Bite

====Usual Depictions====
A suit of blackened armor, empty. The armor bears a kris-like dagger, point downward, dripping red liquid (colored water, usually).

====Companions/Demigods====
The [[Empty Mask]], [[Venom-master Huang]], the [[Dark Blades]]

==== Worship in Western Noefra ====
Official worship of Death's Bite varies by nation.

;[[Holy Kaelthian Republic]]: Church assassins pray to him for aid. His official cult (that of the [[Jagged Knife]]) act as a court of last resort under governmental sanction. The existence of this cult is an open secret, but the location of their central shrine is unknown. Their calling card is a black-hilted silver dagger. They use magic (both arcane and divine) heavily, mostly for stealth and defense. They are most oriented toward removing threats to the government with extreme and silent prejudice.

;[[Jungle of Fangs]]: His worshippers are most common among the less savory elements of society. Several organizations dedicated to him act as bodyguards for powerful figures and collectively control the underworld of that nation. They use copious quantities and varieties of poison. Their calling card is an eyeless, black mask with a single tear embroidered on it. One such organization (the [[Silent Assembly]]) is headquartered in [[Asai'ka]]; the other major organization (the [[Darkened Scale]]) is centered in [[Kel'al'ar]] and is active in whole [[Serpent Dominion]].

=====Religious Precepts=====
You are the last judge of the untouchable. The one that acts where others cannot. No oath or ideal is more important than your mission. Trust no one, verify everything. Preserve the peace of the realm.

====Worship in Other Areas====
The Patron of Assassins is rarely worshiped openly in other nations, although wherever there are those that desire vengeance against the powerful, his name will always arise.
* [[Ikela]]: Open worship is proscribed by law. Rumors of assassin cults are widespread, however.

====Divine Rank====
[[Congregation|Congregant]]

====Pre-Divine Status====
The Hollow King was one of the [[Divine Three]], one of the adventurers who touched off the [[Cataclysm]] by reckless use of the [[Eyes of Qa'desh|Left Eye of Qa'desh]]. A dragonborn sorcerer, prone to violent temper and greed, his ascension has changed him significantly. Some scholars believe that he feels remorse for his actions and has now gone to the other extreme. The truth is unknown.

Wilderness. Travelers. The Hunt, ''Nature, Trickery''
====Personality====
Impatient with civilization. Kill or be killed. Unconcerned with social niceties

====Other Names====
the Huntress, All-tracker
====Usual Depiction====
A dark-haired woman, dressed in forest leathers, with a wolf at her side. In one hand she carries a bow; the other is outstretched with a falcon on the wrist.

====Companions/Demigods====
Two companions—a falcon and a wolf.

====Worship in Western Noefra====
Propitiated more than worshiped, her major devotees are those living in [[Kotimaa]]. Travels through unclaimed lands usually start with an offering to her. An offering is made before setting out on the hunt or on a trip through the wilderness and after returning. The type of offering depends on the type of journey—blood for hunting (your own on the way out, prey’s blood on the way back) or a small amount of travel food for a journey. The officiant will advise on care of the wilderness in exchange for food or a donation.

=====Religious Precepts=====
Take what is needed by force, but with guile. Fools rush in and die. The cycle of life is to kill and be killed—hold no grudges for death. Step lightly and give thanks for what you take; hunt not the mothers with young. Cull the weak, for they hold the herd back.

====Worship in Other Areas====
* [[Ikela]]: Propitiated only in the border and outlying regions, she is included in the rites of the [[Ikelan Religion|CCU]] but only notionally.

====Home====
Her place of residence is in [[Aaru]]; she does not maintain a stable domain.

==== Pre-divine Status ====
Not much is known about her pre-divine status. Some speculate that she was an [[ihmisi]] huntress, but she has shared no information about her history.

The forge. Technology. Patron of Smiths. ''Knowledge, Forge''
====Personality====
Stubborn. Takes offense easily if criticized. Direct.

====Other Names====
the Hammer, Artisan's Muse

====Usual Depiction====
A short, bearded dwarf (of indeterminate gender) wearing a blacksmith’s apron and heavy gloves. It stands at an anvil with a metal blank on it, hammer raised.

====Companions/Demigods====
[[Ignis, Fire-bearer]]. [[Stone-mender Chuluu]]. [[Loremaster Noym]]. [[Gear-cutter Clang]]. [[Potion-stirrer Spark-tinker]].

====Worship in Western Noefra====
Lon-ka is worshiped by more progressive dwarves (especially in [[Shinevog]]), craftsmen in general, and especially the goblins and dragonborn of [[Byarsha]]. New inventions and special items are brought to his clergy to be blessed—copies of the schematics are presented and burned ritually before him. His clergy are always some of the best crafters around. Those touched by the spark of invention are “called by the Hammer.” Most savants venerate Clang and Spark-tinker more than anyone.

===== Religious Precepts =====
Stasis is death. Constantly reach for new ideas and thoughts. Test all traditions by fire and anvil. The world exists to be used—be efficient but don’t hold back. Above all, create new things and share that knowledge. Generosity and collaboration are rewarded.

====Worship in Other Areas====
* [[Ikela]]: Worshiped heavily by the industrial parts of society, as well as in [[Bayannur]] Province, where his clergy are one of the predominant forces in local government.
* [[Oelfra]]: One of the two major gods of several of the [[jazuu]] nations.

==== Divine Rank ====
[[Congregation|Congregant]]

==== Politics ====

Harvest. Agriculture. The Moon. Night. Contracts. ''Knowledge, Nature
====Personality====
Subdued. Pragmatic and reserved. Likes to speak in oracular pronouncements. This was revealed to be deceptive--his true nature is that of manipulator, arrogant and deceitful.

====Other Names====
Shadowed Sun, Harvest Lord, Binder
====Usual Depiction====
A male half-elf (lightly pointed ears and slight elven features, dark hair), wearing simple clothes. He bears a sickle in one hand and a sheaf of grain in the other.

====Companions/Demigods====
[[Sheaf-binder Caleb]], [[Thresher Cain]]

Note: Neither of the demigods managed to retain their divine status in the aftermath of his fall in 251 AC. 

====Worship in Western Noefra====
=====250 and before=====
Worshiped as part of the [[Seasonal Four]] among wall-builders, especially by middle-age men and [[Halflings|halflings]]. Offerings involve first-fruits of the harvest, presented to the priest for his blessing and then eaten as part of a festival. Clergy often solemnize marriages and contracts. A common expression in the [[Sea of Grass]] region is “sure as the sun in shadow”, meaning certain to occur. Worshiped in [[Wyrmhold]], where the contractual precepts are de-emphasized and the hard work precepts are emphasized.
=====251+=====
Although he has been dethroned and can no longer act as a true god, his religious organizations are still fairly strong, especially in the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]]. The other Successor States have mostly abandoned him once his plans were revealed.

=====Religious Precepts=====
You reap what you sow. In hard work is salvation. Carefully prepare for the upcoming winter. Those that will not work, cannot eat. Make bargains carefully, because you will be judged for failing to follow through. Conformity and consensus are critical.

====Worship in Other Areas====
* [[Ikela]]: Worship was significant as part of the [[Ikelan Religion|CCU]], but worship quickly shifted to his successor.

====Divine Rank====
Until 1 Spring Dawning 251 AC, he was a member of the [[Congregation]]. On that day, he was deposed for violations of the Law of Divinity (direct intervention with mortals, being defeated in his mortal-plane avatar form). Since then, he has subsisted on residual worship as one of the [[Ascended heroes|Ascended Heroes]].

The home. Domesticity. The Hearth. Fertility. ''Life, Light''

====Personality====
Gentle but can be fierce if pushed. The peacemaker of the Gods.

====Other Names====
Mother of Nations ([[Ithemba]]), Hearth-keeper, Matron
====Usual Depiction====
A heavily pregnant woman with a spoon in one hand and an open flame in the other. Often depicted surrounded by a bunch of children who are climbing on her and at her feet.

====Companions/Demigods====
The [[Woodcutter]], the [[Fire-starter]]

==== Home ====
[[Mara]], specifically one of the more "country" areas well away from the hustle and bustle. She is also active in [[Shadow]], where she maintains several enclaves for departed spirits.

====Worship in Western [[Noefra]]====
Worshiped by mothers, mostly. The highest concentration of her worshipers is among the halflings on the [[Sea of Grass]], with most clans having an attached priestess (who is never kliba). Her clergy are healers and caretakers (usually women). They are all married and have many children. Unlike [[Melara]]’s clergy, Peor-Fala’s are stationary. [[Halflings|Halfling]] children are brought at the end of their first week to her priestesses for blessings; naming follows later. Gifts of useful items are what she wants—these are distributed to the needy. In [[Ithemba]], the Mother of Nations is one of the two primary gods, mainly worshiped in her fertility aspect.

=====Heretics=====
The [[Sin Eaters]] are a heretic sect that believes that theirs is the duty to take on the sins of violence and “cleansing” so that the faithful can remain undisturbed. They are highly militant and believe in cleansing the world from the unclean (goblins, undead, demons, and orcs mainly). They are active only in [[Kotimaa]], where they maintain a keep. As long as they don’t bother honest folk, they’re tolerated. Rumors among the wise say that although they worship [[Peor-Fala]], it’s [[Roel Kor]] or [[Pinwheel]] who’s their actual divine patron.

=====Religious Precepts=====
Be fruitful and multiply. Children are a blessing. Non-violence is the way to live. Keep the hearth burning and under control. Cooperate with your neighbors. Husbands, love your wives. Wives, obey your husbands. Care for the poor and the orphans and widows. Violence must be the last resort, and only to defend the defenseless. Clergy should not benefit at the expense of others. Possessions beyond the necessary should be used for the benefit of others, especially the poor.

====Worship in Other Areas====

* [[Ikela]]: She is worshipped heavily by the common folk, especially the rural common folk. One of the three or four major deities. Considered a very minor deity of the [[Ikelan Religion|CCU]].
* [[Ithemba]]: Worshiped as Mother of Nations, she is seen as one of the three founding deities and the patron of the common folk.

====Pre-divine Status====
Unclear. Some believe that she was a human from the [[Jinse Empire]], possibly the fabled "Great Mother" of early imperial history (ca 2500 BC).

Lady of the Dawn, Peach Blossom Princess, Friend of Lovers

==== Domain ====
Growth. Beginnings. Spring. Life, Nature

==== Personality ====
Friend to living things. A bit dim. Bubbly. Easily appeased.

==== Usual Depiction ====
A young woman wearing a belted tunic that reaches just above the knees. Her face is open and cheerful. She wears a crown of white flowers; one hand is in front of her, palm flat, with a songbird on it. In painted depictions she is usually standing in a field of spring flowers.

==== Companions/Demigods ====
[[The Fawn]]

==== Worship in Western Noefra ====
Commonly worshiped among wall-builders and those of [[Wyrmhold]] as one of the [[Seasonal Four]] (specifically Spring). Her festivals are dances, parades and parties, celebrating new life. Children born over the winter are named. Unmarried people often find partners—expectations of fidelity are loosened (except among the dwarves, of course). “As seen in Dawn’s light” or “[he/she]’s seeing by Dawn’s light” is an expression meaning that one is over-optimistic (much like saying that someone is a Pollyanna).

Her priests and priestesses also tend to play matchmaker. They're also commonly the biggest gossips around--this is especially pronounced in the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]], where her clergy are the chief information gatherers and communications authorities. While they're frequently non-violent, there are several militant organizations who act to "weed out" those that threaten growth and love.

===== Religious Precepts =====
Protect animals, especially the cute ones. Protect children and young creatures of all races—violence against those that would harm children is required. Be cheerful and happy. Sing and laugh, for winter is over. Spring is a time to fall in love. Have flings, but don't be jealous of others.
==== Worship in Other Areas ====
* Ikela: One of the staple deities worshiped in the [[Ikelan Religion|CCU]]. Also commonly worshiped among the common folk, often syncretically with various [[kami]] and other figures. 

====Pre-divine Status====
Sakara, before the [[Cataclysm]] was the daughter of the man who became [[Loran Hae]] and she who became [[Melara]] and the wife of the future [[Tor-Elan]]. A human woman, she served as a druid in the [[Battle of Acceptance]], where she and her family were all killed protecting the Tree of Worlds.

Arcane Magic. ''Arcana, Knowledge''

== Personality ==
Neutral and dry. Rarely raises his voice. Works to preserve the ebb and flow of magical power throughout the planes. Hates the over-use of magic and punishes those who threaten the fabric of the planes. Not fond of warlocks.

== Other Names ==
Lord of Magic, Tome-bearer

== Usual Depiction ==
A male figure wearing a hooded robe, hood pulled up but face visible. Most prominent feature is his beard, which is divided into 4 long braids—one from each cheek and two from the chin. He carries a staff upraised and an open book.

== Companions/Demigods ==
None

== Worship in Western Noefra ==
Worshiped by arcanists and scholars. Very little organized religion; his clergy are scholars first. They often get in long, arcane (pardon the pun) debates about strange topics. Offerings of books (especially rare ones) are the most prized. “Hooded-one’s Eyes!” is an epithet used to express surprise; “I swear by book and beard” is a strong oath of truthfulness.

=== Religious Precepts ===
Knowledge is power. Keep it out of the hands of those that would use it for the ill of the world, even if this requires violence. Consider the consequences of your magical actions before acting. Search out and recover lost magical knowledge. Maintain an open mind—all truth is truth and should be respected regardless of the source. Blood magic is an abomination.

== Worship in Other Areas ==

* [[Ikela]]: Only has a very minor role in the [[Ikelan Religion|CCU]]. The predominant deity in neighboring [[Merais]], however.

== Pre-Divine Life ==
Yogg-Maggus was one of the [[Divine Three]], the adventurers who precipitated the [[Cataclysm]]. A [[mkhulu]] wizard, he sought after magic. His current state is a punishment for that search.

# County Tsun is mostly border farmers, heavily halfling. They've thrown their lot in with the [[Duarchy of Kotimaa]], but are not formally annexed by that nation. They are lobbying [[Tsun Azur]] to be their ruler--he hasn't agreed or disagreed as of mid-summer 252.
# Lowbridge is the most prosperous of the states, although with trade through the HKR cut off, they're not looking great. But politically, they're the most stable as a merchant republic.
# Dainland is a proudly independent nation occupied by those who fled from the HKR as it became more tyrannical. Extremely poor though, since the Sundown Hills and the Ungoverned Lands cut off easy access to external help.
# Roark is a stationary bandit state ruled with a heavy fist by a former Fist of the Sun. It claims to be theocratic, but is really just a pocket dictatorship.
# The Ungoverned Lands don't have any stable government. There are towns and villages, but they bow to no one outside themselves. And frequently raid their neighbors and any trade passing through.

There the people worship the [[Queen Ascendant]] as their goddess supreme. The [[Congregation]] is only mentioned in passing as if servants—the Queen pre-dates them, after all. While they recognize the Congregation’s power (and worship of them is not forbidden), the Queen Ascendant is the more present icon and symbol of power. Ritual sacrifices (either token blood sacrifices or animal sacrifices, with the ever-present watch of the [[Handmaiden]]s to ensure they don’t slip back into the old forms of human sacrifice) take place every week on Fourth-day and on feast days, with people offering up their wealth or other items on occasions of need.

Fourth-day services are conducted by two different types of clergy. Altarites serve in all areas, down to the smallest villages and directly perform the blood sacrifices and ritual offerings. Sacred Dancers, aided by priest-caste musicians who mainly play the flute and drum, reside in the larger settlements and travel in circuits around the villages. A small village might see a Dancer twice a year (on the major feasts), but rarely more than that. 

A common or lai-caste service usually consists of a short homily--a story from the history of the nation and/or the life of the Queen, mingled with exhortations to virtue and against transgressing the caste boundaries. This is followed by a ritual offering from each family present. Those that can offer a pigeon or a dove (or even a larger animal, although that's saved for major feasts usually) which is slaughtered and the blood, mixed with an alcoholic beverage, is consumed by the priest. A small amount is smeared on the forehead of the head of the offering house in a coiled shape (representing the coil of a snake). Poor families that cannot spare a dove have their finger pricked and a drop of blood smeared on their foreheads in similar fashion. Another drop of blood is mingled with the ceremonial drink. These sacrifices serve as proxies for the worshipper's own soul and that of his or her children and family. If a Dancer is present, the dancer then presents a sacred ritual dance illustrating the story. The flesh of the offerings is roasted and eaten by the congregation as a whole. Lai-caste services only differ in the size of the offering.

Noble-caste services vary wildly. The more pious ones attend the same services as the common and lai folk of their region, often providing a cow or several pigs as a sacrifice/feast. Others have private priests (and the very powerful might have private Dancers)--rumors abound about the orgiastic nature of those services, although this is frowned upon.

In return for this bounty of worship, the Queen is very active in the religious life of the people. She communicates regularly with Her servants, admonishing against evil habits and improper actions. A common watchword/warning is “the Queen’s eye is upon you,” or “She watches,” said when someone is edging too close to wickedness.

The dwarves of the Stone Throne are the foremost zealots of the nation. Dwarven services never involve Dancers and always involve personal blood-letting (in more than token quantities). The resulting blood-wine is shared by everyone instead of the meat of the sacrifices. They occupy places in the clergy at a rate that belies their sparse numbers, and they are the most active missionaries, spreading the word of the Queen everywhere. Here, calling something “dwarven theology” is a compliment—it is to say that the argument or idea is totally solid and irrefutable. On the other hand, the dwarves are also notable for being absolutely inflexible. Transgressions against even minor parts of doctrine are dealt with mercilessly. 

The residents of the south are most likely to mingle worship of the Queen Ascendant with kami-veneration or other syncretism and are generally the least religiously focused, although a resurgence of religious fervor has occurred recently. The north is the most devout region.

== Anima Cycles ==
Anima is formed within a soul when the soul creates new memories, grows, absorbs information--in general, through the process of creation. When a living thing dies, its spark (the portion that creates anima) passes into the [[Shadows]] (for intelligent beings) or back into the Mortal plane (for plants and lower animals). That energy is pumped up into the [[Astral]] by the [[Great Mechanism]] and passed among the gods and used to maintain the universe itself, with a large portion passing into the elemental planes to be aspected and used to continue the natural cycles of the Dream (such as replenishing the air and water, rebuilding the minerals and rocks, and keeping the earth-fire and Eua burning).

Some of the anima created is lost into the [[Abyss]] or consumed by great workings (great acts of creation, usually involving artifacts). Most magic does not consume anima, but creating matter from "nothing" does, as that is the source of the matter. In extreme cases (such as the cleansing of [[Ithemba|North Ithemba]] in 211 AC, the local ambient anima density is severely depleted by such great acts, diminishing the power of magic temporarily.

Instead, most "magic" (fantastic abilities) works by altering the ''aspects'' of the anima. Since all matter and energy is comprised, at its core, of anima, ''aspects'' are the part that distinguishes fire from water, the flesh of a bird from a stone, etc. Aspects can be altered and shifted by magic either temporarily or permanently. But in general, externally-imposed resonant transformations of aspects fades when the resonance does. But the effects caused by that transformation do not--fires lit by magical fire do not go out, cuts from blades of slashing wind that came from no-where do not automatically heal, etc.

=== Aspects ===
''Note: this discussion follows the categorization scheme developed in Western [[Noefra]] during the 3rd age. Other places and cultures have their own categorization schemes. None of them are fundamental; all of them describe the same underlying properties in different ways.''

Aspects can be divided into 4 Elements, each of which has one of three Characters (Umbral, Neutral, or Luminous) and one of two three (Diffuse, Condensed, Balanced). There is anima that is so strongly Characterized that the Elemental nature is irrelevant--these are called Lumina and Umbra; there is also anima that is so neutral that it is called Unaspected (and is almost always diffuse). Thus, there are 36 aspects, but at the ends they all merge into two possibilities. All matter can be categorized as having different admixtures of each of these aspects, although scholars generally divide things into a few groups depending on whether they contain only one Character of a given Element (regular matter) or contain parts of both Characters of a given element (Paradoxical). Most "normal" matter is Regular; many things that have "magical" nature include some element of Paradox. 

==== Elements ====
The elements are those of the core elemental planes: Fire, Earth, Air, Water.

==== Characters ====
Anima can be of Umbral character, meaning it is sluggish, downward sinking, and stable. Luminous anima is effervescent, changeable, and rises upward.

==== Solidities ====
Diffuse anima is imperceptible to "normal" senses, but its effects can be felt as it interacts. Examples include the umbral fire associated with a hot (but not glowing) rock, warmed by the sun or a flame or the thunder of a lightning bolt (diffuse neutral air). The vast majority of anima is diffuse and unaspected, called the "ambient aether". This is the medium that spells and other resonant effects work in. Condensed anima is perceptible--the flame of a fire is condensed anima mostly comprised of Luminous Fire.

==Magic vs Fantastic Abilities==
Generally, the term "magic" is reserved for abilities that form resonant patterns in the ambient anima, like spells and magic items. But all "fantastic abilities" (anything that would not be possible on Earth, nor are truly normal among the people of Quartus) are also fueled by anima. But the forms and properties of these fantastic abilities differ.

===Spells===
Living spell-casters accumulate anima in knots in their souls. These knots come in varying strengths--two lower level "slots" do not equal one higher slot. These knots are used to fuel patterned resonances with the ambient anima--these patterned resonances are spells. Some spells (cantrips) can be cast solely with the caster's mental energy and do not use up these knots. Without special training, these slots reform over time but require a night's rest to be usable again. There are rumors of some who can force energy into their knots faster, but those are not widespread. Some casters can cast certain spells by relying on ambient anima (and thus without using a knot or slot) at the cost of significantly increasing the time required, making them act much more like rituals (described below).

The number of spell-slots available to a caster depend on their level of soul-growth. For many (if not most) people, the ability to cast a single (or at most two) of the lowest-powered spells is the maximum they will ever attain. Some grow quickly, some more slowly. Those who focus on spell-casting tend to grow faster than those who split their efforts with martial pursuits.

While all spell-casters gain power from the ambient anima, the source of the spells (that is, the patterns through which they manipulate reality) differs. Those differences are described in the [[Varieties of Magic]]. The primary sources are
* Harmonic magic is the use of rhythm and music to manipulate anima. This is most associated with bards, common chants and Leviathan.
* Arcane magic is direct pattern-based symbolic manipulation of anima, associated most with the [[gwerin]] and with wizards and the more magically-oriented fighters and rogues.
* Channeled magic is sourced from another creature, where the caster acts as the channel. Associated most with druids and clerics, as well as rangers.
* Personal magic comes from within, often via birth or revelation. The casters rarely can articulate ''how'' they cast, and their magic is tied to their state of mind. Most associated with paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks.

For most mortals, casting spells requires ''components'': gestures, material items, and/or patterned sounds (usually in the form of arcane-sounding phrases). These are not intrinsic to the spell itself; they're merely devices used as crutches to compensate for the limits of mortality. The truly strong beings, such as dragons, angels, demons, etc. generally require fewer such components; those beings with magic in their blood also rarely require components. The exact components are fairly standardized due to a scientific study of magic during the Old Western Empire period. Other parts of the world use different components. Verbal components show the most variation--the exact words aren't important. The cadence, rhythm, intonation, volume, and other sonic factors are what matter. Different schools (especially of wizardry) often obfuscate the truly important parts, and every caster does things slightly differently. They're more mnemonic devices than fundamental facts of reality. 

===Rituals===
Most magic use on Quartus is not really in the form of spells, those discrete, individual patterns of resonant anima. Instead, it's in the form of rituals. With ritual work, the energy needed is gathered by the participants and shared through complex workings; the patterns are formed by the participants acting collectively. Single practitioners can perform rituals, with their ritual objects acting as foci. The oldest and most powerful rituals involve sacrifice of a living being, voluntarily or not. See [[Blood Magic]] for more details there. Often, blood magic is used to spike the power or shorten the time needed, as the concentration of anima in a living being is huge. 

Rituals take much longer than spells to perform. For those spells that can be ritualized, it generally takes 10x as long to perform the ritual as to cast the spell. During this time, the caster (or casters) are vulnerable to interruption--they must maintain their concentration throughout. One benefit of larger rituals is that a practiced group can substitute members seamlessly during the ritual, allowing the longer rituals (some lasting weeks of constant work) to go on without killing the participants.

Rituals require ritual foci--implements, stories, chants, objects that all have relevance to the caster--like spell-casting components, these foci are more for the sake of the caster than for anything fundamental about the universe. Common foci include candles, diagrams, ritual knives, parts of creatures, gemstones, and chants.

Unlike casting spells, even those without "knots" can participate in ritual work. In general, rituals scale with the number of participants more than with the quality of participant--this is why cults prefer many disposable members rather than fewer, more powerful (and thus more dangerous) ones. This is also why village rituals work so well, despite not having anyone of any strength. Quantity has a quality all of its own, after all.

===Items===
Since all magic is mediated through souls, permanent magical items that can actively manipulate anima (cast spells or spell-like effects without needing to be recharged) are quite rare. In fact, some theories suggest that imbuing an item with enough anima to persist and gather anima by itself would by necessity involve the creation of a soul (and thus would make the item intelligent to one degree or another). Temporary magical items such as scrolls, potions, or spellstones (stones that can be charged to unleash magical energies) exist but the creation of these requires an intelligent being to contribute anima and, once used, are rendered inert or destroyed. Items with charges draw on the ebb and flow of the ambient anima to recharge, usually once per day at a fixed time (often midnight or dawn). Creating items generally involves a key item or location associated with the effect desired.

Some more powerful items require the active involvement of a suitable host for their power to be realized--they interface with the nimbus of the wielder and resonate with their souls. Due to this resonance, it is impossible for normal mortals to attune (become bonded to) more than 3 such items simultaneously, and attuning to an item requires time (as does breaking the attunement).

At the current time, items of Uncommon rarity and below can generally be created (given the key items) in the [[Federated Nations]]; those of Rare rarity and above remain the source of adventuring wealth. [[Imperial Legacy]] is the [[Adventuring Company]] most devoted to magic item creation and research. Potions and other consumables are easier to make, with occasional Rare-quality consumables going on the market for connected buyers. Generally, unless you're a member of [[Imperial Legacy]], buying and selling magic items other than consumables is difficult if not impossible.
===Innate and Learned Abilities===
Dragons fly, when their wings are not nearly large enough to carry them. And they breathe energy. These are examples of innate fantastic abilities. There are many others--most monstrosity-class creatures (defined as those with fantastic abilities in a neatly-circular fashion) rely on these abilities. But many adventurers and other powerful people ''also'' use these abilities. They cannot be taught, they can only be gained by personal quirks and intrinsic nature. Most often, these are inward-directed and modify the wielder's own body, enhancing it with anima drawn from the environment. Often, these abilities are not consciously controlled--they merely ''are''. As an example, a barbarian draws in power mediated by his emotional state, enhancing his own body to deflect blows and strike harder.

Other abilities can be learned by someone of sufficient mastery. A fighter blurs into motion, striking like a whirlwind for a brief moment. Another fighter calls out a command and his allies find an opportunity to strike yet again. A rogue wraps himself in shadow for a brief instant, shunting the force of a fireball into liminal space and coming out unharmed. Another rogue climbs as if his fingers were claws. One common characteristic is that these abilities can't be used continuously--they deplete the user's internal reserves. They're not ''magic'', and they can't be countered by dispelling magics; they're merely effects that stretch the boundaries of the possible.

== Arcane Glyphs, Arcane Phrases, and Language ==
When a spell-caster chants magic words or a scroll covered in arcane writing is found, a common question is "what language is it in?" And the short answer is "it's not really a language, at least as we know it. But it's distinctively magic." The long answer is...well...longer.

In the beginning of the Mortal plane there were four main types of "spells" (although that terminology came much later). '''Runic Inscriptions''' (also called Rune Magic), '''True Words''' (or True Sorcery), '''Essential Harmony''' (or the All-song), and [[Blood magic]] (the power of sacrifice). This discussion will only cover the first three, as blood magic is, to this day, different.

=== Runic Inscriptions ===
Wielded by the [[titans]], this type of magic involved empowering (or scribing magically) written "words" or "runes". Much more complex than the current runic scripts, these runes were usually written across the wielder's body, forming part of them and responding to their will. The nature of these runes was most attuned to description--creating and reshaping things by describing its behavior. In 21st Century Earth terms, it was a programming language for the universe. Some of the basic symbols were reused in [[Runic script|High and Low Runic]], the language used for communication, but carefully bereft of the magical properties. To a practitioner of rune magic, magic happened in total silence as well as without unnecessary motion, but did require the material on which to write. Hence the use of the caster's own flesh as the parchment. If you could read the inscriptions, they looked more like mathematical equations, written in 2 and 3 dimensions out of interlocking pieces with every path through the extended glyph adding nuance to the whole. It was best at modifying existing matter, reshaping it according to the will, knowledge, and endurance of the wielder. The titans believed that the Dreamer ''wrote'' the world into existence.

=== True Words ===
The spoken form of the runic inscriptions (or were the runes the written form of the true words?), this was wielded by [[wyrm]]. In essence, they spoke the names of the elements and of matter, commanding them. These "words" were in the language used at the beginning to dream the world into existence--the wyrm believed that the Dreamer ''spoke'' and the world was. Use of True Words wasn't as simple as knowing the right sounds--you had to understand the nature of the things described and have the strength of will to bend them to your purpose. As well as some innate authority over those elements. The inverse of the titan's runes, use of True Words mostly revolved around ''breaking down'' existing matter, commanding it to return to its elemental state, pure and available for reuse. Before the Dawn War, titan shaped and wyrm broke down the excess, cleaned up the mistakes. After the War, wyrm used it to shape by subtraction. True words needed no canvas to write on, only that the voice could be heard.

=== Essential Harmony ===
Song and motion, dance and drum, wordless and free. The specialty of [[Leviathan]] to this day, it neither shaped brute matter nor did it break it down. It ''aligned'' matter, especially living matter. Shaping the will and hearts of others as they resonated to the melodies and formed living counterpoints. More than anything, the song remembers. Leviathan's role was to preserve continuity, to carry the plan between the other workers; after the War, it chose to become a living repository of all the world's knowledge. And that song still echoes through the deep.

=== Wizardry ===
Two of the three primal forms came to an end with the unleashing of the [[Orb of All Might]]. Some say it was the [[Great Mechanism]], acting to preserve the balance and viability of the Mortal plane. Others say it was backlash. Yet others claim merely that the change wasn't to the magic but to the casters; that the reduced forms could no longer wield the true language. But regardless, the names that bound reality became inaccessible to both [[Titans|titan]] and [[wyrm]] in their degenerate state. The [[Ages of the World|Second Wish]] changed that, reassembling the broken pieces of written and spoken words, combined with fragments of harmonies into a new route of access to the power of magic. This was the birth of "wizardry". That's not really properly called, as the scientific field of wizardry known today is but one fragment of this essential form. In fact, ''all'' mortal spell-casting is a variety of this ur-wizardry.

In essence, the wizardry combined writing (mostly in the form of the material components who carry fragments of the names), spoken words (verbal components) and harmony (motion, also known as somatic components) into a way for mortals to access power. In the [[Ages of the World|Third Age]], even divine magic followed this paradigm. True wizards learn to write down and (more saliently) ''learn'' from writing. What are they writing and saying?

=== Material and somatic components and glyphs ===

* Glyphs (found on scrolls, spellbooks, and as containment and definition for spells) are fragments of ancient runes. Not that an ancient titan would recognize them as such--they're the equivalent of taking the curved part at the top of the lowercase "f" and calling that a letter. But some fragment of their power still remains and they can be used as a crude syllabary, a circuit to channel power. Each tradition uses their own subsets of the shattered ur-runes, but the patterns formed are usually fairly distinctive and identifiable across traditions and across centuries, making written spellbooks and scrolls a fairly safe (hah!) method of conveying magical information across generations. However, the patterns are also almost trivially identifiable as magical writing.
* Verbal components are nonsense words...but contain within them phonemic fragments of True Words, spoken at rhythmic intervals (the echo of Essential Harmony). Most casting traditions intermix these necessary fragments into mystic-sounding words; many practitioners don't even realize that most of the phrase is just meaningless filler, there to pad it so the rhythms and emphasis work properly. Different traditions use different fillers, leading to a diversity of verbal components. Due to the inhuman rhythms and phonemes involved, it is nearly impossible to mistake the fragments of True Words for anything but mystic words of power. They sound, by necessity, like no other language.
* Material components contain aligned aether, serving mostly as a catalyst for the spell. Some powerful spells use things like gems as actual fuel, since the caster's power alone is insufficient (and inappropriately aligned). Foci can be used, containing glyphs and important symbols carved into aligned matter. Unlike the other components, very little variation is possible here (although foci confuse the issue)--without the correct catalyst, no resonance can be formed.
* Somatic components align the caster to the flow of the world, both helping them remember the necessary patterns of the soul and enter the correct state of being. Of all the components, these are the most varied because they're the most personal. But for most practitioners, they involve large, unsubtle motions of at least one hand--circular passes, contortions of the wrist and fingers, etc.

Rich with fish and other aquatic life, it is the lifeblood of the [[Serpent Dominion]]. Although it has no outlets, it is fresh and clear. Sages believe that a stable portal to the [[Plane of Ocean]] lies in its depths.

On its shores are ruins of [[Fanged Kingdom]] and ancient [[aelvar]] civilizations; divers have found similar ruins buried in the silt and rock at the bottom.

      <text bytes="4894" sha1="9im53fe0nr0ndtfjn4ralw7kpajghor" xml:space="preserve">The Congregation is the collective name for the complete pantheon of 16 [[:Category:Gods|gods]].

Within the Congregation there are several significant "political" divisions:
==Political Factions==
===The Interventionists===
This group of gods believes that mortals need firm (but gentle) direction to mold them in the way of right and progress, and that the gods should bend their efforts in that direction as much as possible. They are the most apt to communicate directly (or as directly as allowed) with their followers and prescribe patterns of worship and behavior. The interventionists are not entirely united in the exact direction they should be pushing, however.

====The Seasonal Four====
This group, made up of [[Sakara]], [[Tor Elan]], and [[Melara]], are the most actively-interventionist deities. They push strongly for collective conscience and communal behavior, for unity and universality of faith and for proselytization of that faith. Their most notable church in [[Noefra]] was the [[Church of the Seasons]], headquartered at the [[Grand Temple]] in [[Kaelthia]], capital of the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]]. Since the fall from grace of [[Loran Hae]], things have shifted and that temple has gone silent.

They are not henotheistic--other gods are allowed to be worshiped and placated in their order of things. However, the four of them have primacy and the others are subordinate. This has not won them many friends among the other ascendants.

====Other Interventionists====
[[Lon-Ka|Lon-ka]] is another notable interventionist who is not allied with the Seasonal Four. He believes that the way of progress is the way of ''technological'' progress and advancement. Invention, discovery, and science are the things he pushes. He is primarily worshiped in [[Shinevog]], and has become the patron deity of that nation.

[[Roel Kor]] is the other notable interventionist. He believes that progress is best made with a strong ruler. Him, particularly. He allows his people to pray to other gods, but in his churches, his role is paramount. Order above all, and order by strength--these are his teachings.

===The Dutiful===
The opponents of the Interventionists are the self-proclaimed Dutiful. They believe that to actively interfere with mortals would be to step beyond their bounds and will only lead to chaos and war. Instead they act mostly to counter the Interventionists and to encourage mortals to learn and create their own truth and right.

Although there are fewer of them, they have the upper hand politically due to their unity. The Dutiful congregants are [[Korokonolkom]] (the most conservative), the [[Hollow King]], [[Yogg Maggus]], and (strangely) [[Pinwheel]].

===The Peace Faction===
These just want everybody to get along. They act as the third party, siding with one group or the other to maintain stability. They are [[Peor-fala]], [[Ytra]], [[Aerielara]], and [[Kela Loran]], and [[Sarapha]].

===The Unaligned===
The last two congregants really don't care what happens to mortals. Their concerns are elsewhere. These are [[Selesurala]] and [[Lae Loara]].

==Rules for Divine Interactions==
The Congregation are not the highest powers. The [[Great Mechanism]], via its Voice, has put restrictions on all [[ascendant]]s, the gods among them.
# Gods can be in multiple places at the same time via avatars. Only one of those places can be in the mortal plane.
# Deific avatars are vulnerable, as if they were (powerful) mortals. If a mortal-plane avatar is destroyed, the god itself is removed from its place in the Congregation. Destroying an avatar on another plane merely removes that source of information until another avatar can arrive. It does piss off the god rather tremendously.
# Gods cannot discriminate based on style of worship--all prayers in faith must be treated the same, regardless of adherence to mortal-plane religious protocols.
# Except by incarnating on the mortal plane or in response to a "proper channels" spell (ie commune), the gods cannot directly talk to mortals and must use agents, especially when acting of their own accord, rather than in response to a plea from a cleric. These agents must be at arms-length--no puppets. This includes clerics.
## When responding to a spell, they are bound by the strictures of the spell. 
## If a mortal visits the Astral in person and interacts with an avatar, all interactions must be agency-preserving. The avatar can answer questions, if doing so would not impinge on the agency of the individual, but cannot answer a different question, even if that's what was really desired. These restrictions must be stated up front on any first interaction.

== Holy Symbols ==

The [[Kaela River]] has its headwaters in the mountains and runs through the city.

==211 AC==
About 10% of the population of the Council Lands (25,000 people) lives here, mostly humans and dwarves. High elves are present, but not common. Half-elves are rarer still. [[Halflings]] live in the surrounding farmland. Wood elves, and dragonborn are rare. Half-orcs generally are not welcomed within the city, but are not forbidden.

The city is set in a pocket canyon and enclosed on the open side by by two 30-ft-tall stone walls. Buildings in the wealthy areas and public buildings are dwarven stone work. Middle-class homes and shops are half-timbered and tend to be 2 stories tall. Poor buildings are wattle-and-daub construction. The city is quite spread out, with most groups of buildings surrounding a central communal garden.

The primary industries here are the mines and forge complexes on the outskirts of the city and the academy and temple complexes. The central council meets in a dedicated building near the academy. Farms cover the surrounding area outside the walls, run mainly by halflings and humans. 

Kaelthia is culturally a xenophobic and socially stratified. Humans and high elves hold all the positions of power and have established a “meritocratic” caste system based on aptitude tests. All those considered suitable for academic pursuits are removed from their families and enrolled at the Academy. Those who are identified as “wild talents” are shunned. Those with a divine connection are enrolled at the temple complex as acolytes. Choice of vocation is denied on general principle. Arranged marriages are common among the wealthier (or status seeking) clans. Public use of magic (arcane or divine) and public performances are restricted—non-academy graduates must purchase a 100gp revocable license. Unlicensed actions are punishable by exile.

Kaelthia gets its nickname ("City of the Dragon's Hoard")) from the brass dragon [[Marcia (Dragon)|Marcia]] who nests in the mountains to the south-east of the city. She, along with her allies, was instrumental in saving the starving refugees from the final battle of the [[Cataclysm War]]. She still takes an interest in the safety of the city and the surrounding areas but does not get involved in politics.

[[File:kaelthia211.png|frameless|300px|Kaelthia in 211 AC]]

==250 AC==
    Kaelthia after the fall of the [[Council Lands]] and the rise of the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]] is a very different place. The stratification is gone, replaced by uniformity within communities and diversity between communities. Each neighborhood lives by its own consensus, guided by the beneficent light of the [[Temple of the Four]] and its hardworking priests. The priests coordinate between neighborhoods, finding places for everyone and helping everyone thrive in their place. There is no waste, no begging, no poor, no rich. All are equal, all are valued. --Official History of the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]]

    The above is propaganda preached by the [[Holy Hands]]. While it's true that there are no longer the vast disparities between the slums and the Old Refugee Quarter or those living in the mountain estates, now everything is the same. Each street has its assigned house color, and woe betide you if you don't maintain it perfectly. Preferences have to be stated as "The consensus would be best served by ''this'', one might think", because saying "hey, I don't want to be a prostitute" is considered anti-social behavior. And who controls what the "consensus" picks? Those damned priests. Who never get in trouble for mistreating one of the girls (or boys, some of them like them young and innocent). Who never have to pay for their liquor and only ever get the best. A group of blue-robes in your joy-house is a business-killer. --Anonymous pamphlet distributed in Flowercourt, ca 248 AC

    After the departure of the [[gwerin]] to [[Southshore]] and the formation of the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]], [[Kaelthia]] saw a major change. Down came the old mansions, up went row after row of identical stone houses in groups of four, each sharing a roof and a small garden. Only the Arcantor's Palace remains of the former High House seats, now the seat of the [[Grand Consensus]]. Everything's pretty and clean--no beggars in the streets or nightpails being dumped out windows on the heads of those passing by. You can tell what neighborhood a person's from by their clothes--it's like a uniform. You do see a huge swath of different faces--no child looks like their "parents", because children are assigned to other districts based on need and "talent". Everyone seems happy, but maybe that's just an act, put on in fear of a neighbor tattling to a priest. Or a child. Or maybe I'm just drunk...again. --The [[Immortal Bard]], ''Tales of the Future''.

[[File:Kaelthia250.med.png|800px|frameless|Districts of Kaelthia, ca 250 AC]]

====Demographics====
'''Total population''': Nearly 40,000

'''

====Districts====
Not shown here are the large number of "suburb" communities that sprawl out of the Outer Wall. Many of them were once villages, now part of the same urban area.
; Flowercourt : This is the "entertainment" district. Those who live here are singers, dancers, artists, actors, and prostitutes. And often more than one of those.
; Forecourt : This district is dominated by a large market where those coming in deliver their goods for dispersal throughout the city.
; Embassy Row : This is the "foreign" quarter, for those who are not citizens of the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]]. HKR citizens who work here must carry passes, and vehicles leaving are searched (ostensibly for contraband, but really for stowaways).
; The Empty Aerie : A mercantile and crafting district for the outside, still bearing signs of the architecture of the dragonborn who once inhabited it.
; Outwall Waterside &amp; Outwall Mountainside : Two districts that each try to be "holier than thou".
; Mercy Waterside &amp; Mercy's Hand : Districts where women run the consensus.
; Little Temple : A small district home to lower-ranked priests and a large temple, serving as the spiritual and administrative hub of the Outwall.
; Westwall North &amp; Westwall South : Districts once home to the richest of peoples. Now crammed cheek by jowl up into the mountainside.
; Inwall : Residential area known for bakers and red roofs.
; Crossbridge : Merchant district.
; Coinage District : one of two heavily dwarven areas. Access to Mountainholm and Guild-town is through a tunnel in this district.
; Smith's District : The other heavily dwarven district, home to the Alkh clan. Metalwork is sold here (the foundries are in Mountainholm).
; Finecrafter's Court : Home to the other fine (but mundane) craftsmen.

A former cleric of a dead god of knowledge, she was the chief administrator of the [[Towers of Sun, Earth, Moon, and Stars]] at the time of the [[Cataclysm]]. She ordered the Towers to phase into a demiplane as part of defensive measures against the onrushing catastrophe. Because of the (unanticipated) disruption of magic, the Towers were unable to return to the [[Mortal]] plane. With her god dead, she lost faith and became paranoid. In a desperate effort to survive, she and her direct followers (including her sister [[Kinlanna]]) called on the [[White Skull]] and sacrificed most of the population of the Tower of the Moon to fuel a portal connection back to Quartus. Due to the temporal distortions, they landed in the [[Jungle of Fangs]] in approximately 200 AC.

She immediately moved in on the then-current ruler of the Southern District, [[Il'ka]], overthrowing him with her arcane and demonic might, and took control of that district. She was actively engaged in exacerbating the demon worship then prevalent in the [[Stone Throne]].

==Overthrow and destruction==
#Tried to strike a deal with the [[Catalysts]] (mutual non-interference). That was rejected, but gave away her portal network coordinates.
#She began to build a demon-fueled bomb to strip the souls of the entire population of [[Kel'al'ar]] to fuel her ascension to the rank of [[Demon Princes|Demon Prince]].
#An alliance of special-forces groups, including the [[Catalysts]], the [[Scale Balancer|Scale Balancers]], as well as Byssian and Wyrmhold forces rallied to stop her.
#Her sister [[Kinlanna]], as well as the [[White Skull]] (because she had reneged on her deal with him and was siphoning off souls to her own power) assisted the alliance in distracting her and opening the way.
#The alliance struck through the portal and bought time for the [[Catalysts]] to strike deep into her complex and defuse the bomb.
#There they encountered her and fought.
#With her dying strength, she used a [[Fangs of Resolution|Fang of Resolution]] to sacrifice herself to tear a hole in the [[Crystal Sphere]], intending to allow the [[Awakener]] through (mostly out of spite).
#[[Kinlanna]] and the [[Catalysts]] entered the portal formed and fought off the encroaching forces at the edge of the [[Dark Beyond]] until [[Kinlanna]] could use the Fang (and her own soul) to seal the breach.

      <origin>1385</origin>

      <text bytes="4793" sha1="4zsakf7649dres04ivj39k3zgoslemg" xml:space="preserve">The aelvar are the proto-elves. Descendants of the [[lightborn]] and ancestors of the [[gwerin]], [[Puun Ihmisia|puun ihmisia]], and [[goroesi]], they forged the first world-spanning empire. This was destroyed by [[Moon's Fall]].

==Creation==
The [[lightborn]] who accepted mortality after the [[Dawn War]] fell under the influence of the [[titans]] during the [[Ages of the World|Age of Tyrants]] and were shaped by them to be overseers and "house slaves". They retained an innate connection to the [[Astral]] plane, inheriting a measure of the grace and agelessness that characterizes their astral relatives, the [[lucian]]s.

While they were taught fragments of runic lore and also wielded minor wild sorceries and the first stirrings of harmonic magic (taught by [[Leviathan]]'s agents), their powers were minor and completely unable to compete with the tyrant races.

==Empire of Wizardry==
In the aftermath of the backfiring of the [[Orb of All Might]], the aelvar, now freed from the dominion of titan and wyrm, saw their chance. They sought out the [[Eternal Library]] and the [[Cosmic Forge]] residing therein and made the [[Ages of the World|First Wish]], creating wizardry out the fragments of runic magic and true sorcery that remained. Binding spoken and written words, they learned quickly to manipulate reality. And without the gods or other powers to constrain them, they developed magics that reshaped life to their whim.

Aelvar sorcery, unlike modern "regulated" wizardry, focused on manipulating matter more than elemental forces. The ancestors of modern spells such as ''polymorph'' and ''alter self'' were commonplace, but were able to make permanent alterations and were not limited to existing forms. The aelvar wizard lords used these enchantments liberally, reshaping plants, animals, and even sentient beings to suit their needs, desires, and whims. Many, if not most, of the "monsters" and strange creatures owe at least part of their origin to aelvar manipulation. Of course, the [[Twisted]] was incredibly active during this period, walking the land in mortal form and urging the wizard lords to experiment with greater abandon.

The aelvar empire covered almost all of what is now [[Noefra]] and [[Soefra]], which at the time were joined as one. Only the [[Dragonreach]], by imperial decree, remained neutral and in the possession of the dragons. In exchange, draconic rampages were limited and constrained, and the dragons served the aelvar as mounts and advisors (something the proud dragons have never really forgotten nor forgiven).

Those who could not or would not work wizardry became progressively more ostracized, leading to the creation of the [[puun Ihmisia|ihmisi]] race to mark those "degenerates" and strip them of their near-immortality. As with most acts of hubris, this backfired badly.

==Downfall==
===Moon's Fall===
Main article [[Moon's Fall]].

===Aftermath===
In the aftermath, the remaining aelvar lords used the [[Eyes of Qa'desh]] to split the continent apart, separating [[Noefra]] from [[Soefra]]. The survivors mostly stayed on [[Soefra]], leaving only a remnant on [[Noefra]].

With the wizard lords dead or fled, the aelvar (now [[gwerin]]) people scattered to their Houses. A racial memory of cataclysm remains, some say, which is why no great [[gwerin]] empires were reborn from the ashes except the hubris-filled [[Phoenix Empire]] of the south.

==Remnants==
There is one aelvar currently living--Queen [[Raanee]] of the [[Crisial Kingdom]] was born into a minor noble family about 12 years before [[Moon's Fall]] and was, through the sacrifice of her parents, preserved through the cataclysm along with her mixed-blood nurse.

Most of the elven races descend from the aelvar--
; Gwerin : The [[gwerin]] are those who clung to the arcane emphasis and maintained their connection to the [[Astral]] until the [[Cataclysm]].
; Puun Ihmisia : the [[puun Ihmisia|ihmisi]] were an accidental creation, being those who were exiled or made outcast for rejecting the arcane traditions of the aelvar empire and rejecting servitude. They enacted the [[Ages of the World|Second Wish]] and became wielders of primal power, leading to [[Moon's Fall]].
; Goroesi : the [[goroesi]] or dark elves were created as crafters of wondrous things and as artists to serve the high aelvar nobles. They get their alternate name from the color of their skin, which ranges from dark grey to black. Thought to have gone extinct at [[Moon's Fall]], two small populations are known to exist. One lives under [[Moon's Fall Vengeance]], having taken shelter in a time-warped bubble for thousands of years, while the other resides under the mountains separating the [[Great Rift]] from southern [[Soefra]].

      <text bytes="13273" sha1="gidvyq4e7zlt7gbh9pcrcd8c0wvp31h" xml:space="preserve">The [[Source of Magic|source of all magic]] is the energy of the soul itself. This article will describe the sources of the patterns ("spells") of each of the traditions of spellcasting ("classes" to use game terms). Although for the sake of the game spells are codified and the same spell cast by casters of different classes have the same effects, in-universe the patterns differ and the effects can be varied. Not all spells in the printed materials can be learned; there are innumerable others that can be cast but are not described in the printed books.

==Bards==
"Bard" is the name given to those who resonate with reality using performance and the strength of their personalities. Through music, dance, oratory, or other performance they bend the minds of others, charm and confuse, etc. They learn their tricks (spells) by trial and experimentation. This means that they know fairly few spells but are less restricted by traditions and schools than some others. It should be noted that many people called bards do not have access to more than a few basic tricks (cantrips or simple first-level spells). Bards who can fully use their powers and grow in power are very rare. The bardic college is the organization devoted to bards.

Bardic (or Harmonic) magic was one of the earliest forms of magic, dating back to the First Age, when agents of [[Leviathan]] taught mortals (the proteans and lightborn especially) the power of songs and chants. The chants used by commoners (especially in the [[Successor States]] are a primitive, ritualized form of harmonic magic.

Bards are about equally common throughout the [[Federated Nations]]. There is a Bardic College in [[Kaelthia]].
'''Other Names''': often shamans and witches actually wield bardic magic.

==Clerics==
"Clerics" are the servants of the [[Congregation]] in the mortal realm. They are chosen by the gods and contract with them. Their spells come through inspiration and faith--as their personal power grows they gain access to more powerful prayers and words that resonate with reality. Most of a cleric's spells are shared in common with other clerics (by covenant among The Heavenly [[Congregation]])--a few spells are specific to the aspect of the god being worshiped. It should be noted that, as with bards, most clerics are incapable of more than the very most basic magics. Most can cast the equivalent of one first-level spell per day. Of the rest, all but a tiny fraction cap at third-level spells. Other than adventurers, the number of clerics in the [[Federated Nations]] that can cast ''Resurrection'' (a 5th level spell) is very small (less than a few dozen). Clerics tend toward organization and tend to follow established orders devoted to one or a small set of gods.

As a note, most priests are not clerics. They do wield divine power, but only by specific delegation. This means that while some priests can create effects similar to a 5th level spell, they may not be able to choose their spells (unlike clerics, who are less constrained). Most priests also are incapable of creating very many adventuring-relevant effects.

Clerics are most common in the [[Successor States]] and in [[Wyrmhold]]; priests are common in the [[Jungle of Fangs]], but mainly draw their power as warlocks instead. Clerics are vanishingly rare in [[Byssia]]--priests there are actually Pledged serving [[Nocthis]].

'''Other Names''': Clerics of each member of the [[Congregation]] use culturally-specific names and titles. For instance, wandering clerics of [[Selesurala]] are often called "storm crows," while priests of [[Korokonolkom]] are known as Listeners.

==Druids==
Druids gain access to spells through communion with the [[kami]] or spirits of nature--genii loci, elemental spirits, fey creatures, etc. Unlike warlocks who make a single contract with a single powerful being, druids make deals with the lesser spirits that suffuse the landscape. Each spirit allows itself to be bound to a task in return for packets of aether from the druid. These tasks are expressed as spells. This gives the druid a wide array of effects to choose from; he or she must choose during meditation what pacts to make each day as only a limited number of pacts can be maintained simultaneously. Of all the full casting traditions, druids are the most common as this is the tradition followed by most tribal shamans (although many shamans follow bardic traditions or are incapable of casting spells). The exact expression varies between the tribes--some are more elemental in orientation and others are more animal-focused. They tend to cap around 4th level spells with a very few capable of 5th level. Druids are not usually organized beyond the tribal level.

Druids are most common in [[Byssia]] and in the [[Orcs|orc]]ish areas of [[Wyrmhold]], although [[Southshore]] is now home to a Circle, and the [[puun ihmisia]] of [[Kotimaa]] also commonly follow these traditions. Druids are rare in the [[Jungle of Fangs]], although not unknown.

==Paladins==
Paladins are empowered by the fervency of their oath. Or so they like to think. In reality, their source of power is the sacrifice inherent in the oath. By choosing to restrict themselves, they become sensitive to the patterns of aether and can influence them. It is hypothesized that paladins devoted to more abstract concepts could have access to wizard-like spells. The restrictions seem to be self-imposed, not imposed by an outside force. This means that a paladin who "falls" by rejecting her oath and turning toward darkness and hate finds that her power has changed and become more monstrous, not because the source has changed but because the paladin's soul has changed.

Organizationally, the main order of paladins in the [[Successor States]] the one sponsored by the clerics of Ytra, the [[Scale Balancer]]s. They dispense justice without mercy to lawbreakers or to those the law can't touch (due to positions of wealth or prestige). Those who join this order renounce positions, heritage, inheritance, and rank. Their symbol is a golden circle. The appearance of a paladin of [[Ytra]] is met with the same fear and despair as would be a tidal wave. Most other paladins are not part of a formal order--they wander in pursuit of their oath with a small group or with only a squire.

Because a paladin spends much time on martial pursuits, they learn spells at a slower rate than do clerics and their abilities are more martially focused. It is said that the preceptor of the [[Scale Balancer]] Order can cast fourth-rank spells.

Most devotees of these Orders are oath-sworn (meaning that they've made binding vows and promised to abide by the tenets of the Oath). This does not make them paladins--most gain only very limited (if any) supernatural power. The ability to sense truth, the ability to identify unnatural creatures at sight, a limited amount of healing, supernatural resistance. These are the most common such abilities; other than these, most oath-sworn are simply well-armed, disciplined men-at-arms.

===Orders and Oaths===
Three orders are most visible in the [[Federated Nations]]: the [[Scale Balancer]]s of the [[Successor States]], the [[Crownguard]] of [[Wyrmhold]], and the Sinner's Tear (found throughout).

The [[Scale Balancer]]s swear to root out falseness and to punish wrongdoers. Their motto is "Let justice be done, though the heavens fall." They pledge themselves to the service of [[Ytra]] and are highly hierarchical, although not political.

The [[Crownguard]] swear to protect the queen of [[Wyrmhold]] with their lives and souls. They are the Crown's agents; honor and obedience come before anything else.

The oath-sworn of the [[Sinner's Tear]] swear to protect the light from the darkness, to take on the sins of the world so that innocents don't falter. Most of them believe themselves damned beyond redemption, but have a fierce dedication to not letting others go down that path. Unlike the others, they are non-hierarchical--the "order" is a loose association of wandering knights and their squires (often novices on that dark and lonely path).

==Rangers==
If druids work to ameliorate civilization's impact on nature, rangers act to ward civilization from nature. As they gain power, they learn to contract with the spirits in much the same way as do druids. A big difference is the nature of these contracts--druids make and change contracts daily. Rangers contract with smaller spirits but bind them to themselves, rarely if ever changing their contracts. Some rangers even bind themselves to the soul of a beast, gaining its aid and in return strengthening it with their own aether. More than just a well-trained animal, these beasts take on a piece of the master's soul and personality.

Rangers tend to be loners--there is no formal organization among rangers, although they trade and share information with other like-minded folk. Most people called rangers are unable to cast spells, with a few capable of casting first or second level spells.

Rangers progress more slowly than druids and their spells tend to be channeled through their weapons to enhance the effects of their strikes.

==Sorcerers==
"Sorcerer" is a catch-all term for those whose spells come from their heritage (their genetics). These come as genetic memories or patterns as natural as breathing. They impose their will on reality by force of will and are not as bound by strictures and structures as other spell-casters. As they gain experience and power they learn to manipulate the patterns, breaking the normal limits of the spells. As a side effect, they tend not to have very many patterns available to them. Like clerics, relatively few can cast above 3rd-level spells. Sorcerers are rarer than either clerics or druids.

Sorcerers are most common in the western nations--[[Wyrmhold]] and Byssia. [[Dragonborn]] sorcerers (who almost uniformly take after their draconic heritage) are respected by the clans and organized into schools. [[Byssia]]n sorcerers usually arise in connection with the elements or by the intervention of astral beings. Those touched by [[Shadow]] and those affected by wild, uncontrollable magic both crop up at random throughout the [[Federated Nations]].

==Warlocks==
Warlocks are those whose power is based on a contract. Often these individuals do not have intrinsic powers but gain power by forming a contract with a powerful being. These contracts may impose more or fewer strictures on the warlock--those who make contracts with fiends (devils mostly, as demons are...dangerous) tend to see the most interference while those who contract with stranger beings have little interference but often develop weird tics or quirks as a result of continued exposure to eldritch forces. Those pledged to astral beings act much like priests and are tied to the worship of their "deific" patron. Those who contract with fey powers tend to act normally except for a single oddity that reflects the quirks of their contracting partner. Warlocks are rare and not organized. Gaining power is easier for warlocks than for others, but much more hazardous. Warlocks who don't naturally cap in potential burn out or are consumed by their contracting partner.

The status of warlocks depends on the nation. The [[Jungle of Fangs]] has many devoted, both to fiends and to astral beings, and they have respectable status. Many "priests" in the jungle are closer to warlocks than to clerics--the [[Queen Ascendant]] cannot create clerics (not being a member of the Congregation). Fey warlocks are particularly common in Byssia. Warlocks pledged to astral forces or intelligent artifacts are common in the Dynasty. The [[Successor States]] generally look askance on non-astrally-pledged warlocks (with the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]] having outlawed such pacts entirely). With the influence of [[Catalysts|Catalyst]] Vassarian, warlocks pledged to certain, more bizarre, powers are becoming more tolerated and starting to come out of hiding.

'''Other Names''': Pledged, Devoted. Many priests with power are actually warlocks pledged to astral forces.

==Wizards==
Wizards are unique--they learn spells through research, study, and experimentation. As a result they can learn spells from other wizards, but are bound to their spellbooks. Losing a spellbook is a traumatic experience for a wizard and such books are usually heavily guarded. Wizards have the widest variety of spells available. The [[Granite-Flame Academy]] is the center-point for wizards and primary source of their training. The Academy has the largest surviving collection of research materials. Wizards were the hardest hit by the changes of the [[Cataclysm]]--as the structure of the world changed, so did the resonances that make up the core of wizard spells. Thus, wizards had to relearn how to use magic and many blew themselves up or burned themselves out in the attempt. Wizards are not as common as clerics or druids, but more common than powerful bards, sorcerers, or warlocks.

Distributionally, the most powerful wizards are found in the [[Successor States]], with the [[Jungle of Fangs]] second. Wizards are rarer among the [[Byssia]]ns; [[Wyrmhold]] tends to the shamanistic, oath-bound, and sorcerous paths.

      <text bytes="6855" sha1="m34r7180e2zx5cte882d5fmtvb10acm" xml:space="preserve">The ophidian race dates back to the beginning of the [[Fanged Kingdom]], roughly 1000 BC and were the ultimate inspiration for the creation of the [[dragonborn]] race. The [[gwerin]] rulers had uncovered hidden secrets from the [[aelvar]]--the techniques and patterns that were used to create [[humans]] and [[orcs]]. They applied these in lesser ways, breeding in traits of their favored animals, the serpents, into their slave populations of elves and humans. Almost all residents of the [[Jungle of Fangs]] descend from these experiments and alterations. The results varied tremendously. Over the 1200 years since then, the various groups have interbred primarily with similar kindreds and have created distinct lineages. The ophidians are one of these. They are the least human, the most altered. 

Visually, ophidians are slender, graceful, and slightly shorter than the [[fang-kin]], standing 5'2" on average. Males and females show little sexual dimorphism; secondary sexual characteristics are small. Facial and body hair is minimal on the majority of ophidians. Their eyes show the distinctive vertical-slit irises and most commonly are red or iridescent green. Their hair is more mottled in scale-like patterns than the [[fang-kin]], and tends to be straight or wavy. Scale-like patches of pigmented skin cover parts of their bodies, most commonly the chest and neck and the upper legs.

Different lineages exist, each claiming to trace their heritage to a specific type of snake. Some evidence of this exists--certain groups have an operational venom sac and can inflict a nasty poisoned bite while others cannot.

Culturally, ophidians tended to live on the outskirts of society until the Ophidian Treaty. In [[Asai'ka]], they are considered second-class citizens and discriminated against, while in the [[Serpent Dominion]] they have integrated into society pretty well and are common among the priesthood (especially the Temple Dancers). The [[Sha'slar Autonomous Zone]] is not home to many, but they are accepted if they are willing to work like anyone else. A few tribes still keep to their old ways in the deep jungle at the southern tip of the jungle, however.

They live throughout the [[Jungle of Fangs]] but especially in the [[Serpent Dominion]] at the southern end of the region.

==Ophidian Racial Traits==
'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Dexterity score increases by 1. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Age'''. Ophidians age at a similar rate as humans and have similar lifespans.&lt;br/&gt; 
'''Size'''. Ophidians are similar in size to humans, although generally slightly shorter and more slender. Your size is Medium. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Speed'''. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Darkvision'''. You have superior vision in dark or dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of grey. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Languages'''. You can speak and write Common and Iadth Nedyr. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Venom-blooded'''. You have resistance to poison damage. &lt;br/&gt;

===Constrictor===
Raised among a group that counted the big constrictor snakes as their ancestral spirit animal, you have developed strength and skill with grappling.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Strength score increases by 2. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Serpentine Flexibility'''. You have advantage on any ability check made to impose or escape a grapple. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Constricting Grasp'''. When you have someone grappled and you take the Attack action, you can replace the attack (or one of the attacks if you can make more than one with an Attack action) with the following. The grappled target must make a Strength saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the target is restrained. A restrained target may reattempt the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the restraint on a success. While a target is restrained and you take the Attack action, you can forgo one attack to deal 1d4 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage to the restrained target.&lt;br/&gt;

===Venom-tooth===
Small but deadly, the coral snake is one of the most venomous of its kind. Your ancestors partook of that essence.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Dexterity score increases by an additional 1 and your Constitution score increases by 1.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Serpentine Evasion'''. When you succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, you can choose to instead take no damage. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until you complete a long or short rest.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Poison Bite'''. You have a fang that you can use as an unarmed attack. When you hit with an attack using this natural weapon (which counts as having the versatile trait), you deal 1d4 poison damage + your Dexterity modifier piercing damage.&lt;br/&gt;

===Beguiling Cobra===
Taking after the hypnotic swaying of a cobra’s hood, you have learned to charm and beguile.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Charisma score increases by 2.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Innate Spellcasting'''. You learn the friends cantrip. You can cast animal friendship once with this trait; if you target a snake, it has disadvantage on the Wisdom saving throw. You regain the ability once you finish a long rest. When you reach level 3, you can cast enthrall once with this trait and regain the ability once you finish a long rest. When you reach level 5, you can cast hypnotic pattern once with this trait and regain the ability once you finish a long rest.&lt;br/&gt;

==The Isal'psa==
One side effect of the manipulation imposed on their ancestors is that ophidian children have a significantly increased risk of somatic birth defects, including fused legs, malformed heads, and missing or vestigial arms. When such a child is born, they are traditionally taken to the shamans for "treatment". This treatment involves both rituals and drugs, and results in death or the creation of an isal'psa--a king snake. The malformed body part is transformed into a snake-like appendage--fused legs into a functional snake tail, missing or vestigial arms are replaced by serpentine, fanged appendages, and heads are shaped into a hooded visage resembling that of a cobra. Failures either die outright or become a full hybrid of snake and man, called a kapar'psa (protector snake) for their enhanced protective impulses.

The isal'psa are held in reverence by most ophidians, especially the more tribal ones. Polite [[fang-kin]] culture considers them unclean and shuns them, however. Isal'psa are almost uniformly sterile--the drugs and magic involved (along with the body-reshaping) removes their sexual desires and capabilities. Instead, they become emotionally cold and distant, able to lead by pure reason and persuasion. Some develop significant magical powers.

      <text bytes="7930" sha1="1o3szmeil9y1gfhim7k9m3iyx3egc6g" xml:space="preserve">The plane-touched are those races whose parents were "normal" members of their race, but who were influenced before birth by powers outside the norm. Some of these have more particular names.

==Astral-touched (AKA God-born)==
[[Humans]] + influence from the astral plane, especially demigods and ascended heroes. Rarely from fiends, and only then when on divine errand.

'''Ability Score Increase''': Your Charisma increases by 2. One other score of your choice increases by 1.

'''Age.''' As humans, maybe +10 years or so. They do tend to look youthful until very close to their deaths, aging very gracefully.

'''Size'''. As the human parent sub-race.

'''Speed'''. Your base walking speed is 30'.

'''Touched by the Light''': You gain the Ritual Caster feat, choosing your rituals from the cleric list.

'''Region of Origin''': Anywhere humans are found. Most common in the former [[Council Lands]] areas, especially the [[Sea of Grass]].

'''Languages''': You know Common as well as Lucian (aka Infernal).

'''Lucian Origin''': Choose what role your lucian heritage takes:

* ''Messenger'': Once per long rest you can unfurl wings of light as a bonus action. These give you a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute. Additionally,  you have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks while your wings are active.
* ''Warrior'': Once per long rest you can charge your attacks with luminous aether as a bonus action. For one minute, your attacks (weapon or spell) deal an additional 1d6 radiant damage on hit. Additionally, you have resistance to radiant damage.
* ''Healer'': You gain the Lay on Hands paladin feature, except that the pool of healing is equal to 5 * your proficiency bonus. If you gain the Lay on Hands class feature from paladin levels, the two pools merge--your total is 5*(level + proficiency).

==Tieflings, devil-kin==
[[Humans]] + fiendish influence. Most common in the former [[Council Lands]] as a legacy of the [[Cataclysm]] and in the [[Serpent Dominion]] due to the [[Devil's Rebellion]] that occurred there.

'''Ability Score Increase''': Your Charisma increases by 2. One other score of your choice increases by 1.

'''Age.''' As humans, maybe +10 years or so.

'''Size'''. As the human parent sub-race.

'''Speed'''. Your base walking speed is 30'.

'''Darkvision'''. You have darkvision out to 60'.

'''Region of Origin''': Anywhere humans are found. Most common in the [[Jungle of Fangs]] and the [[Jinse Empire]].

'''Languages''': You know Common as well as Lucian (aka Infernal).

'''Fiendish Origin''': Choose which form your lucian influence takes:

* ''Destroyer'':  Once per long rest you can charge your attacks with fire as a bonus action. For one minute, your attacks (weapon or spell) deal an additional 1d6 fire damage on hit. Additionally, you have resistance to fire damage.
*''Winged Alter'': Once per long rest you can transform into a winged, devilish shape as a bonus action. These give you a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute. Additionally, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks while the shape is active.
*''Skulker:'' Once per short rest you can fade into the shadows, becoming invisible until the end of your next turn. Additionally, you gain proficiency in Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
*''Seducer:'' You learn the ''disguise self'' spell and can cast it without using a spell slot. Once you do so, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest. Additionally, creatures that try to investigate your disguise have disadvantage on the check.
*''Scholar'': You gain one Intelligence-based proficiency of your choice and one language of your choice. 

==&lt;Element&gt;-born==
[[Humans]] + elemental influence. Each of the four types is called a different name (with regional variation), such as "flame-born" or "sea-born", etc. Most common in [[Byssia]] (water and air) and in the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] (earth and fire). But found wherever humans are.

'''Age.''' As humans.

'''Size'''. As the human parent sub-race.

'''Speed'''. Your base walking speed is 30'.

'''Ability Score Increase''': 1 of your choice. One set by your subtype.

'''Region of Origin''': Anywhere humans are found. Most common in Byssia and the Giant Spine Mountains.

'''Languages:''' You know Common as well as one variant of the elemental tongue.

'''Elemental Nature''': Choose one of fire, water, air, or earth. That choice influences your Adaptation and Primal Power traits. Each one also grants a different ability score increase, increasing an ability score by 2. This cannot stack with your free choice.

* Fire: +2 INT or STR
* Water: +2 WIS or DEX
* Air: +2 CHA or DEX
* Earth: +2 WIS or CON

'''Adaptation''': Your elemental nature gives you resistance to a type of damage, as well as the ability to tolerate extremes.

* Fire: You are resistant to fire damage and comfortable even to high temperatures.
* Water: You are resistant to cold damage and comfortable even to very high pressures (such as being underwater).
* Air: You are resistant to lightning and thunder damage and comfortable at high altitudes and cold climates.
* Earth: You are resistant to acid damage and you can always find the direction to the nearest entrance when underground.

'''Primal Power''': Your elemental nature gives you access to minor elemental powers. Each of these can be used proficiency bonus times per long rest.

* Fire: When you are struck by an attack from within 5', you can use your reaction to deal 1d10 fire damage to the attacker. This increases to 2d10 at level 5, 3d10 at level 11, and 4d10 at level 17.
* Water: You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed and can breathe underwater. In addition, you can touch an object and ask one question about its past interactions with people. The information you gain is fragmentary, but useful. If the item has nothing useful to say, you do not expend a use of this ability.
* Air: Your walking speed increases by 10 ft. You can use this ability to jump a distance up to your walking speed, landing safely. Alternatively, you can use this as a reaction when you fall to land on your feet without taking damage.
* Earth: You encase yourself in rocky armor for 1 minute. When you do so, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level and you cannot be grappled, restrained, or moved against your will while encased. The encasement ends if you become unconscious or incapacitated.

==Tymoroesi==
These are fae-touched elves, born either of dalliances between elves and fae or (more commonly) of strong fae influence on an area. They are rare and only sometimes breed true. As such, they are considered novelties among the elves. They are only noticeably present in [[Byssia]].

==Waere-kin (shifters)==
These are fae-touched [[humans]], capable of assuming aspects of animals. This does not imply that their parents interbred with animals, but that they were conceived in an area of unusually strong [[kami]] influence. Most common in [[Zhapai Karmap]] and regions there-about, they are also found in the [[Great Rift]] on [[Soefra]]. A tiny group of them, born of demonic meddling, lives in [[Godsfall]].

==Kharan==
These are fae-touched dwarves, specifically touched by those fae associated with anger, vengeance, and endurance. The only significant community of them is in the [[Giant Spine Mountains]], at the old Bolor clan-hold. They generally hate dwarves and resent them for abandoning them. Their culture is harsh and violent.

==Gnomes==
See [[Gnomes]].

==Jashil (firbolg)==
Fae-touched [[jazuu]]. Only fragmentary records remain that mention these beings. Reportedly they were more in tune with nature and the [[kami]] than their fellow [[jazuu]] (who tend to be physically rather than spiritually oriented). Many were shamans and druidic practitioners. It is believed that the largest concentration of them is on [[Oelfra]] among the ruling giant-kin.

      <text bytes="1517" sha1="e010mte1ld4v4egy7hqytehbmou2fzd" xml:space="preserve">The Scale Balancers are the paladins, fighters, and clerics who follow [[Ytra]], goddess of Justice. They work in close coordination to form a patrolling judiciary force. They are most common in the [[Successor States]], but they have started to spread to [[Wyrmhold]] and the [[Jungle of Fangs]]. Their motto is "Let justice be done, though the heavens fall." Their symbol is a stylized pan scale, in balance. Members often have this symbol branded into them--a common location is the palm of their non-dominant hand.

The head of the Scale Balancers in 211 was the [[Fulcrum Anna]]--an older human woman who (unlike many of her compatriots) has a dry sense of humor. She resides in [[Kaelthia]] in the [[Grand Temple]]. Her lieutenants are the Twin Pillars. [[Alaina]] is the Right Pillar, a young, serious [[plane-touched | celestial plane-touched]] whose notable feature is her glowing hair. Calling her "Sparkles" is legally recognized as a form of suicide (unless you're one of the [[Catalysts]] or her superior in the Order). She heads up the enforcement arm and takes great pleasure in smiting the wicked. On the Left, heading up the investigatory branch, is [[Tolam]]. A [[tiefling]], Tolam is known for his absolute dedication to the pursuit of truth. It is rumored that his agents employ stringent means to uncover truth, no matter the station of the person under the Question.

Scale Balancer paladins most frequently take the Oath of Devotion, although other Oaths are common.

      <text bytes="2437" sha1="tbo8tccbrekk1x9u7arut0jbfdy8oo1" xml:space="preserve">As part of character creation, you need to create a background. We prefer custom backgrounds.

==Custom Backgrounds==
Customizing your background can be done in several ways. First, you can always trade out any of the following:

*Any skill for a different skill.
*Any tool or language proficiency for another tool or language proficiency (including tool for language or vice versa).
*The background feature for another printed background feature.

None of these changes listed above require permission.

Or, you can create your own from scratch. Follow these rules:

#Choose two skills.
#Choose two languages or tools (or one language and one tool).
#Choose starting equipment
#A pouch of gold between 10 and 20 gp.
#A flavor item (unique tool, such as shovel, a musical instrument, etc).
#1-2 trinkets
#Choose one of the printed background features or talk to the GM to determine a suitable feature.

==Background Peculiarities by Starting Region==
Not all backgrounds fit as written for all regions. For example, there are no hereditary aristocrats in [[Byssia]]. Thus, the Noble background needs modification. Backgrounds not mentioned can be used as written.

===[[Successor States]]===
Sailor (any): The only sailing done is fishing on Lake Co'yin. Piracy is known, but rare. Another variant would be Caravaneer, trading vehicles (water) for vehicles (land) and gaining advantage on haggling checks. Instead of passage on a ship, you gain passage on a trade caravan. 

===[[Jungle of Fangs]]===
*[[Ophidian]]s from outside the [[Serpent Dominion]] should not choose the Noble background, as they are still mostly considered second-class citizens.

===[[Windwalker Confederacy]]===
* Sailor does not work for this origin. It's an entirely landlocked culture.
* Acolyte: exchange for Shaman's Apprentice. Change Religion skill to Arcana.

===[[Byssia]]===
* Acolyte: since very few Byssians worship the Congregation, acolytes are either caretakers of ancestor-worship shrines, shrines to local spirits, or other local facilities.
* Noble: Instead of being actual nobility, you'd be the offspring of a local village chief or other notable person.
* Sailors are common here.
 
===[[Wyrmhold]]===
* Hobgoblins and orcs should not chose the Noble background unless they take the Knight variant.
* As with the Windwalker goblin tribes, the sailor background does not work. Use the Caravaneer, described above.

Pick a region allowed for your race (see [[Player Option--Variant Races]]). You gain proficiency in the item listed under common proficiency and one of the other listed proficiencies of your choice. If you already have proficiency in the common item from your race or background, you gain proficiency in the item listed after the slash instead. If multiple are listed for a category, choose one.

      <text bytes="1807" sha1="kdo7iu1tna1cwi5zpwwfiv2nqq9k08o" xml:space="preserve">Other than [[Noefra]] (the main play area), there are three other continents. Up until the end of the 1st Age, three of them (Noefra, Soefra, and Oelfra) were combined into one pangean continent. Oelfra broke off first in the aftermath of the First Wish; [[Soefra]] broke off after the Second Wish. The [[Forbidden Lands]] have always been separate.

Oelfra split off much earlier—the last act of the Titans and Wyrm at the end of the 1st age was to split the world. Those dragons that retained most of their ancestral power and those giants who held onto some runic power fled west. A rough land of mountains and valleys, Oelfra is gigantic. The two regions are separated by a narrow land bridge.

==Northern Oelfra==
Home to the great dragons and other mega-fauna, there is no formalized government. Each brood claims a portion of territory and each understand that to invade another’s claim means war to the death. There are humanoids (mostly goblinoid and elven), but they cower in primitive huts and villages and worship the dragons as their gods. Only one city exists—the neutral city of Kar’Khemish.

==Southern Oelfra—The Rune-bound Domain==
Home to the inheritors of the Titan’s runes, here giants rule over vast estates of workers. The giants exist in a strict hierarchy. The lesser races are on the bottom rung, although those that can wield the runes are considered honorary giants. Dwarves are common, as are goblinoids. 

== Dragonmount--Toryuu ==
The island of [[Toryuu]] is located in the bay between northern and southern Oelfra, and is a neutral ground. Home to the [[Eldest (Dragon) | Eldest Dragon]] and the site of the [[Congress of Wyrms]], it is also home to the great [[jazuu]] and [[Dwarves|dwarven]] city of [[Toryuu City]].

===Political Map===
[[File:soefrapolitical.png|frameless|Political map of Soefra]]

The area north of the [[Riftwall Mountains]] is known as the [[Great Rift]]. The majority of it is wild jungle inhabited only by primitive tribal groups; the only "civilized" nations there are North and South [[Ithemba]] (center, in green and blue), [[Ikela]], [[Two Moons]], and the [[Ship Folk|Sena'ka Ship People]] (who mainly dwell on the [[Barrier-Tooth]] island chain off the top of the map in the [[Primal Sea]]). The southern nation of [[Dusk]] has colonized the northern shore of the [[Bay of Separation]], but settlements are few and far between in that hostile place. The southern half of the continent is dominated politically by the [[Phoenix Empire]] and its Mage-Emperor. [[Dusk]] and [[Dawn]] are (formally) satrapies, client states of the [[Phoenix Empire]], but act with significant latitude in daily operations. The [[Southern Confederacy]] is a recently-formed loose collection of escaped slaves, nomadic tribes, and others who resist entry into the Empire; their independence is only due to the inward-looking decadence of the Empire in the last few generations and they very well know it.

Geographically, the Great Rift is separated from the Empire by the Riftwall--an escarpment reaching nearly 15,000 feet above the floor of the Rift. It's sheer sides daunt any access to the south; only the tunnel known (to the Empire) as [[Exile's Shame]] connects the two. [[Traitor's Gulf]] and the [[Bay of Separation]] complete the "waistline" of the continent. Only the half-elven nation of [[Two Moons]] bridges the gap with any frequency. The Empire is situated in the [[Solar Highlands]], a mountain-rimmed high plateau sitting at nearly 4,000 feet above sea level. Strong elemental influences as well as long-standing arcane wards keep the area fertile and comfortable year round.

Home to four major nations, the Giant Spine Mountains border the [[Sea of Dreams]] to the east. This range is the traditional dividing line between western and eastern [[Noefra]]. The highest peak in [[Noefra]], [[Skypiercer Peak]] is located here, along with the original homelands of most of the [[dwarves]] and [[jazuu]] on the continent.

==Nations==
* [[Zhapai Karmap]]
* [[Shinevog]]
* [[Tuura Adam]]
* [[Bolor Hold]] (AKA the Abandoned Clans)

== Climate ==
Heavy winds, especially on the western side of the range. Summers are short and cool (mostly due to altitude). West and south are very wet, getting multiple feet of snow every winter. Eastern side is much drier, as are the wastes. Extreme winds are the norm, especially in the southern pass.

The Comiedai were to be the collection point for the memories, while the mkhulu went forth on land. Original design was for the parasites to sit inside a humanoid and watch, but not consume.

One of the first comiedai (later known as the [[Twisted]]) "went rogue" and twisted the design[1], creating modern cerebromorphosis, with its complete consumption of the host mind and the mkhulu abantu (brain eaters). Some comiedai remained faithful, most did not (many followed the Twisted). Later generations of mkhulu abantu broke free of comiedai control and now seek their own purposes.

Most mkhulu consider themselves a superior form of life (intellectually and physically) and consider normal humanoids nothing more than "cattle, some of which have potential". Very few are more benevolent, but still mostly consider themselves separate and better. A tiny fraction experience "incomplete" transformations, where the original personality survives alongside the parasite's mind (as per the original design). "Traditional" mkhulu kill these "abominations" on sight.

Contrary to popular belief, mkhulu don't only eat brains--if they did there would never be enough. Mkhulu need mainly brains at specific parts of their reproductive cycle--right after cerebromorphosis and then every few years before spawning more larvae (to become fertile--lack of brains prevents this cycle from occurring). They do like the taste of brains, and prefer them living where possible. Benevolent ones only eat freely donated or animal brains or those of condemned prisoners/enemies killed in self-defense. Due to their altered mouth-parts, mkhulu do require soft food, preferring to eat their normal food in the form of pastes or mush (often from flexible tubes).

[1] later discoveries suggested that the [[Twisted]] was never a [[comiedai]], but was a relic of the [[Dawn War]].

The Tome-master is not the highest-ranking arcanist at the [[Granite-Flame Academy]]. He’s the one who lost the bidding war to avoid being stuck as the Academy’s mage representative on the Council. A divination expert, Korthan is also the representative for the [[Oracle Society]]. While he rarely gets involved in the more political matters directly, he is tireless behind the scenes. His focus is in expanding and maintaining the power of the Oracle Society and the Academy in the life of the Council Lands. His power-base and influence were strongly shaken by the advent of the [[Catalysts]] (an event completely unforeseen by the Society) and he’s been working hard ever since to regain control. He is especially influential among the richer human population, who depend on the Society to retain their power. There are rumors that he attained his position more through blackmail and blacker magic than by traditional arcane prowess, but no credible evidence has reached the [[Scale-balancer]]s yet.

;Demographic Information: Korthan is a human male in his late 70s. Physically, he’s best described as a prolate spheroid--he’s substantially overweight for his height (5’4”). He often summons and rides a specialized Floating Disk when he needs to go more than a few paces. This has gotten even worse as he has aged. Mechanically, he’s a tier 1 wizard-style caster (2nd level spells). Whenever he’s out of the Academy, he travels with a significant bodyguard complement.

;Personality: I'm a snob who looks down on those who can't appreciate fine art.

;Ideals: Power. Knowledge is the path to power and domination.

;Bond: I sold my soul for knowledge and plan to get fair value out of the bargain.

;Flaw: I'm always in debt. I spend my ill-gotten gains on decadent luxuries faster than I bring them in.

;Alignment: Neutral Evil

      <text bytes="7986" sha1="mqk6pjnqqimm34v3xurqcj2tsj3yo39" xml:space="preserve">==Founding==
Tlaloc, son of Chaac, was the last of the Water Serpent People. His tribe had been destroyed by the never-sufficiently-damned Moon Tortoise People. The two Peoples had once been allies--Tlaloc had even been promised to marry a daughter of the Moon Tortoise People. But a traitor (may his name be ever forgotten) taught them the secret ways into the Water Serpent home, and that was the end. Only 6 of the Water Serpents had escaped, Tlaloc among them, mainly by being out hunting when the attack happened.

Returning home to find the home fires out and the heads of the men and old women of the tribe on totem poles around an abattoir, they fled into the night. Three fell within the next day, victims of Moon Tortoise ambushes. The survivors headed south-west, toward the only refuge they knew. The [[Drowned City]], home of ghosts and monsters lay on the coastline. Few who entered ever left, but the People had a legend. That if one were strong enough, brave enough, desperate enough to fight through the dangers to the central temple, they could gain great powers. Tezcal, son of Omet, was the first to fall--a giant crocodile, larger than any seen in the People's history, swallowed him in one bite. Metztli, daughter of Omec, trainee shaman to the People, died to poison darts that flung themselves from holes in the wall of the temple. But Tlaloc survived.
The grand central chamber, once ornately decorated in praise to some long-dead god, now stood flooded with murky, brackish water, the walls dripping with a softly-glowing slime. As Tlaloc stood, panting from exertion and stress, at the edge of the pool, a soft, strange voice echoed in his head.

"What brings you here, son of Change, land-dweller? What have you to offer me, the great Illuun?"

"I offer myself", the bitter youth cried, "body and soul. Just let the Moon Tortoise know the full weight of their deed and suffer for all eternity!"

The unknown voice laughed, gurgling. "Vengeance, is it? Such a petty thing. You land-dwellers are so limited."

"Vengeance is all I have. My people are dead, butchered and enslaved. My friends are gone. Only hate remains."

"Very well, then, I am amused. It has been a long time, as your mayfly lives go, since I dealt with mortals. Come, throw yourself into My Pool, and let us see if your body can serve as the instrument of retribution. I must 
warn you, however. Either way, you will not survive the process."

"What do I have to live for? My only wishes are for my enemy to know pain and to join my people." With this, Tlaloc, son of Chaac, threw himself into the dark waters.

Tlaloc did not survive, it is true. But his body, now bearing the face of a squid, walked out of that pool some time later. The renegade cell of [[Leviathan]], the [[comiedai]] [[Illuun]], placed a parasite in his brain. This parasite, having devoured all the memories and knowledge of young Tlaloc, and bearing the strange mental powers of [[mkhulu|his kind]], rose up and, true to Tlaloc's wish, wreaked horrific vengeance on the Moon Tortise People. The tribe went mad, with mocking words whispered in dreams and visions in the daylight. Brother turned against brother. Sister against mother. Father against child. Those that did not die lost their minds, becoming husks, puppets controlled by [[Xolotl]] (as the being who once was Tlaloc now called himself).

But [[Illuun]]'s design did not stop there. Xolotl then turned to the other Peoples. Some he conquered by subtle words, by flatteries, insinuating himself (disguised, of course) into their inner circles and supplanting their leaders. Those that would not yield to honeyed words, he conquered by force with his army of ghouls and mind-slaves. Soon, all the surrounding peoples were his.

For a long time, Xolotl's gaze turned inward, toward building a unified nation. No longer Peoples, free to roam and to hunt and to gather, each with separate traditions, now they were the Tlalocana, the People of the Waters.

==Nation and Culture==
A city was built, [[Tlaltotexanan]]. Utilitarian and severe, the City of Standing Water exemplifies the life of the Tlalocana. The central building is the great and solemn [[Darkwater Temple]], a step pyramid housing a sacrificial well—into this well those deemed worthy of “the change” throw themselves; some arise later as be-tentacled Servants of the Waters, the elite members of society. With this transformation they are given a new name by Xolotl, who bears the title of Chief Servant. A court at the front of the temple contains the execution grounds, where condemned criminals are brought before the Servants and their minds are burned out, turning them into zombie-like husks. Lesser criminals are “re-educated”—mind magic is used to bind them from committing that same crime again.

The society is placid on the surface, with everyone putting forward a happy face and working hard. Underneath, fear rules the day. No one knows who might be an informant or a disguised Servant. Efficiency is the rule—do your assigned task quickly and without complaint, lest you be punished. Inability to perform up to spec is only tolerated in children, and even those have their tasks. Those that perform above expectations are rewarded with status and slaves to handle the necessary tasks, freeing the high performers to do even more. Marriage and long-term families are tolerated, but disfavored. Having children by high-status people is encouraged. Women are strongly expected to have as many children as practical; children are raised in communal creches from a very young age by slaves and women too old to work effectively to free their mothers to go back to work. As a result of this and extensive magical aid with crops, the Tlaltocanan population has been rapidly expanding for the last two generations and now stands near 400,000 (including slaves, which make up about one quarter of the population). Slavery is not generational—children of slaves are considered citizens (as long as they obey the laws) just like children of free-men. On the flip side, those who falter in their devotion to the Way of Pure Thought are doomed to become slaves, just like those captured in outlying areas who know not the Way.

Dissent or free-thought is only tolerated in one group—the [[Followers of Rushing Waters]]. These special people are those identified as innovators and super-intelligent seekers of new, more efficient ways of practice. They are granted privilege to ask questions and consider thoughts that others cannot. They are not granted high rank and can never rise above their status. They are both pariahs and respected (albeit odd) members of the community. Their sign is one red sleeve, as well as a tattoo of a waterfall across their back. Counterfeits (magical or not) of this garb are a capital crime.

The Tlaltocanan army is organized to a degree not seen in most other nations. They build forts at rigid intervals, all identical. They also build roads (mainly using slave labor) through the jungles. Without ready access to many sources of good iron (the mines being in the monster-infested hills), their weapons are made of bronze (spears and short swords) and they wear layers of cloth, stiffened with leather, for armor and carry shields. Javelins are the ranged weapon of choice, every soldier carrying three or four.

Currently, Tlaltocana directly rules an area between two major groups of hills, about 18,000 square miles of jungle. They founded towns every day’s walk, and all neighboring towns are connected by roads of stone, shell, and cement. An outer ring of forts, the nuclei of the next ring of towns, bridges the gap between the hills. The People of the Water dominate the area around this as well, despite not formally controlling it. Raiding parties search for remaining tribes (most having fled north already) to enslave or surviving pre-war ruins to plunder, as well as mapping out sites for new towns.

      <text bytes="2649" sha1="dssjfti4tah226ouxrq20qa59qenb77" xml:space="preserve">Bestial and brutal, the Red Fang is the patron of slaughter, savagery, and blood-lust. Most were-creatures and other shape-shifters pay at least token homage to the Fang, as do spree-killers and berserkers who glory in blood. Its cult is most active among the less civilized tribes (especially [[orcs]]). It urges its followers to rend, kill and devour. Its plots are direct and usually extremely violent.

The Red Fang is the youngest of the [[demon Princes]], dating back only to the very beginning of the Third Age. Born an orc named Gromach, twin to Serak, he was chosen as a daemonhost by the hag that ruled his tribe. This ritual would implant a [[jotnar]] in the body of the sacrificial victim, creating an unstoppable weapon of destruction and rage at the cost of the victim's soul. But Gromach was strong. Instead of being devoured by the [[jotnar]], he dominated that spirit of entropy and chained it to his own will. Channeling the power of this fel entity, he and his sister (a capable shaman) rose to lead a unified host of orcs, goblins, humans and elves (along with others) in a vicious war of conquest that spiraled out over much of [[Noefra]]. His power and his sister's cunning and magic led them to victory after victory, and his armies swelled.

It wasn't until the [[First Heroes]] enacted the Third Wish and gained divine power from the new-born [[Old Gods]] that they were able to infiltrate his citadel and kill Serak while Gromach was away; they left her mutilated, desecrated corpse as a message. This was the straw that shattered Gromach's control. Giving fully into the rage, he demonified and caught the [[First Heroes]] unaware. It was all that [[Aerlan Godspeaker]], the only survivor of the ambush could do to banish him to the [[Abyss]], where he remains to this day.

==Physical Appearance==
Bestial, the Red Fang generally appears as a lycanthrope in hybrid form, except gigantic in size. Blood drips from his maw and fires burn in his eye sockets. He is death and bloodlust--his presence drives people mad and causes them to tear at each other.

==Personality==
Utterly mad with rage, the Red Fang has only animal cunning left. He does not speak and generally rampages around his demense. It is his followers and lieutenants who maintain his cult. His desires are for destruction and bloodshed, and it doesn't matter whose blood falls to the ground.

His cult was part of the attempted abyssal takeover of North [[Ithemba]], which was foiled as a result of the [[Demon's End (Campaign)]]. His cult was also involved with [[Godsfall]] before that city's liberation.

Demons are mostly former mortals, but eternals such as elementals and [[lucians]] can become demons as well. Demons are widely varying in nature, attitude, and appearance, but share some common features.

==Common features==
Demons are all infested with [[jotnar]] but have avoided being consumed by them (which differentiates them from the [[undead]]). Instead, they find some way of feeding the [[jotnar]], usually in the form of other living souls or other demons. The greater demons may have many trapped souls inside of them, harnessing the power of both the bound souls and the [[jotnar]]; lesser demons must find their food by hunting in [[Shadow]] (mainly in the [[Waste]]), leaching off of cultist sacrifices, or devouring other demons.

Demons cannot exist for long in the Mortal realm without a host. This host may either be an anima construct (the result of a summoning spell) or a living host (creating a [[daemonhost]])); some have found ways to embed themselves in physical objects. "Bare" demons are ejected back to the [[Abyss]] by nature itself after a period that depends on the power of the demon. Stronger demons are ejected more rapidly, while weak demons may last months or years.

Demons corrupt the world around them. The [[jotnar]] that sustain their existence drain the life out of their surroundings as well as impose abyss-aspects. Areas frequented by demons (usually as a result of summoning) end up blasted wastelands where life struggles and is warped (the Great Waste surrounding [[Mt. Fearg]] in the [[Great Eastern Dustlands]] is a prime example). [[Shadow]] in such areas becomes the [[Waste]], where the barriers to the [[Abyss]] are weakened and demons roam, consuming and infecting the spirits of the dead. Those who die in these areas frequently daemonize themselves if they are not consumed by demons first.

Demons hunger. Life in the [[Abyss]] requires a constant influx of energy; the [[jotnar]] and the nature of the plane itself demand it. As such, they constantly scheme and seek for new sources of power.

==Organization==
Demons are not exactly organized. Many of them have flocked to the banners of the [[Demon Princes]], the most powerful of their kind. Others act on their own.

It has five continents (although some scholars count [[Aenimos]] and [[Perdatos]] as one continent for the sake of numerology).
==General Characteristics==
Quartus is about the same size but slightly colder than Earth. It has a radius of roughly 6300 km. It has an orbital inclination of 0 degrees (seasons being provided by elemental influences rather than axial tilt. Its orbital period is 384.00 days and a rotational period of 24.00 hours

Proud and formal, Oro-laen is the most intellectual and the most approachable (for mortals) of the Outcast. He even keeps his promises; those contracting with him are advised to carefully review the contract before signing. He is interested in the dark side of magic--necromancy, undeath (especially free-willed undeath), black magic, blood sacrifice, etc. He emphasizes knowledge as a source of power over others. His cult (under the symbol of a white skull) recruits from the magically active (especially warlocks and sorcerers) and practices ritual magic including blood sacrifices and necromancy. The [[Granite-Flame Academy]] has been heavily infiltrated by the White Skull Cult.

He is the demon prince most apt to have "normal"(ish) relations and interactions with mortals. He has interacted and even helped adventuring parties at times, when it suited his goals. Notable instances include during the freeing of [[Perkunos]] and [[Tatsuryuu]] during [[Finding a Home (Campaign)]] and during [[Demon's End (Campaign)]].

Their wars defined the First Age of the world. What has been forgotten is that those wars were not universal. Some titans and wyrm got along and even became friends.

Not all titans made their homes in the Mortal realm after the Dawn War. Some took up responsibilities in the elemental planes. The rulers of the opposed planes of Earth and Air were both titans--Korokonolkolm ruled the Plane of Earth from the mountain super-fortress of [[Saxum Magnus]] and Perkunos governed the Plane of Air from the [[Amber Palace]] at the center of the Eternal Storm. Being divorced from the [[Mortal]] realm gave them vastly extended lifespans and immense power, at the cost of their creativity and, for a lack of a better word, humanity.

Perkunos, unlike most titans, had very little interest in domination or control. Such is the nature of Air, a nature of which he partook--freedom and tolerance, coupled with randomness and unreliability. He quickly made alliance (and later deep friendship) with the Wyrm of the Waters, [[Tatsuryuu]], ruler of the Plane of Water. He and [[Korokonolkom]] politely detested each other--Air considers Earth to be stodgy and slow, while Earth considers Air to be flighty and unserious. Earth made alliance with the Wyrm of Flame, but that is another tale.

After the Second Titan-Wyrm War ground to a stalemate, the [[Titan Conclave]] began planning for the Last Titan-Wyrm War, planning a weapon capable of bringing them total victory over their hated foes. This weapon, christened the [[Orb of All Might]], was the brainchild of the titan rune-seer Zhaz, influenced by the whisperings of the [[Broken Concept]] of Order, an ancient demon they named [[Zharan]]. Empowered by the runic potential of the lesser titans, drawn unwillingly from the masses (reducing them to modern-day dwarven-kind), this Orb gave its wielders, the Conclave, near total dominion over the Mortal realm. At a price yet to be seen.

As they discussed their plans for war, Perkunos (an honorary member of the Conclave) took a stand. Appearing at the Conclave's council room with [[Tatsuryuu]], he spoke out against the Orb and against their plans. He warned that the Great Mechanism would not allow a cost-less victory and reminded the Conclave of the Second Law, "All things in balance; no power without price." The Conclave did not take this well. Led by [[Isskap]], one of the foremost warmongers of that body, they cast him out (ostensibly for treason because he was allied to a wyrm) and used the new-born Orb to curse the both of them to be forgotten forever and imprisoned in stone until "the elements shift from their course and fragment and until mortals and demons rebuke an angel for dereliction of duty." As this dread curse fell on the two of them, they gave of their elemental power to lay a counter curse against those that use the Orb--"To receive as given; all acts mirrored."

Succumbing to the Conclave's curse, Perkunos and Tatsuryuu turned to stone and their bodies were transported to a purpose-built mausoleum later known as the Halls of the Dead. As mockery, they were placed with Perkunos upright in a chair and Tatsuryuu coiled around that throne. And then were forgotten. No being, mortal, elemental, or astral, remembered that they existed. Tatsuryuu's place as ruler of elemental Water was filled by her daughter, [[Selesurala]]; Perkunos' place was never filled, as the denizens of Air didn't really need a single ruler. And thus they stayed, lost to time and memory, for more than ten thousand years.

The Conclave thought that their conditions were impossibilities, but the future proved otherwise. At the Cataclysm, the explosion caused by the misuse of the [[Left Eye of Qa'desh]] misaligned the elemental planes, bringing devastation and disarray. As a result, the former unity of the planes splintered and the current 12 planes were born. Two hundred or so years later, the adventuring team known as the Wild Cards were asked to investigate the Halls of the Dead, an ancient mausoleum near the [[Tuura Adam]] nation. There they found the (fallen) angel [[Tzeru]], she who was once tasked with maintaining the prison at the [[Pactum Battlefield]]. She was engaged in drawing spirits from the [[Shadow]]s there, the spirits of those buried in that ancient place, and condemning them to oblivion or to serve, shackled to the bones of the fallen. In her madness, she had abandoned justice entirely, condemning them for crimes imagined or minor. When defeated by the [[Wild Cards]] in open combat, she called out to the [[White Skull]], Prince of the Undead and of Black Magic, claiming to have been doing "his work" and asking for a deal, for power. When that infernal being appeared (briefely), he joined the party in rejecting her claims of "justice" and "duty", and chided her for dereliction of duty. This completed the strictures set forth by the Conclave, breaking the curse.

The [[Wild Cards]] then parleyed with the awakened Perkunos and Tatsuryuu, bringing them up to speed with the happenings in the recent past; the two then shifted out to the [[Astral]] Plane, to visit [[Selesurala]], since ascended to the [[Congregation]] of Gods in the wake of the [[Cataclysm]]. Since then, the two of them have worked with the goddess to learn about the changes to the world since then.

==Perkunos, Thunder-lord==
A Storm Giant Quintessant who casts as if he were a level 20 Storm Sorcerer.
;Personality: Genial, laid-back. Prone to flashy actions.
;Ideal: Freedom for all. All must be left to make their own choices and mistakes.
;Bond: Tatsuryuu is my friend, for whom I will sacrifice much.
;Flaw: Not good with deception. Very blunt and straightforward, almost to a fault.
;Alignment: Chaotic Good

Focusing on technological and magical improvements, Shinevog has attracted many dwarves and others who felt constrained by tradition. As such, it's one of the most free-wheeling and "free" nations. The only law is the wheat-based one--"work if you want to eat."

Occupying the Aidas valley at the edge of the [[Giant Spine Mountains]], it dominates the only over-land trade route between the rest of the [[Federated Nations]] and the societies of the mountains and the pass into eastern [[Noefra]]. As such, it has become quite wealthy in recent years.

Nothing material can pass through; the infectious thought forms of the [[Awakener]] can and do slip through, manifesting as red-purple hexagonal crystalline shards. These are tracked and destroyed by the [[angels]] as much as possible. Occasional fragments do reach [[Quartus]], however, and infect the local wildlife until detected and destroyed.

      <text bytes="5417" sha1="jf5kqwjv4y9bsec47div1bzgjegn9cf" xml:space="preserve">''Scribal note: This is the only surviving record of the events leading up to the Cataclysm War. It appears to have been the professional journal of a ranking member of some international organization. Most of the names are unfamiliar. The first large piece of the manuscript deals with mundane matters.''

...Record begins...

We realized something was wrong when the oracles started speaking in contradictions. “All is well. All is lost,” one said. Others spoke in gibberish (more so than normal). Most simply stared into the distance, minds broken.

Scrying proved fruitless. No new concentrations of aether, no pockets where eyes couldn’t reach. Our first concrete sign was an unusual stirring among the orc tribes of the north. They seemed more organized than usual. The wood elves of the region reported increased large-scale incursions. The numbers of raids were still within the norm, but we dispatched extra forces to investigate.

The next sign came from a caravan travelling from Imperial Meztli to the [[Iron Dominions]]. The border guards reported that the caravan was attacked by a dragon in the unclaimed border fens, but the hired mercenaries accompanying the caravan managed to defeat it. The odd thing was that the mercenaries then sold the remains of the dragon to a [[gwerin]] magus who came from a tower in the fens. This raised some attention since the fens were a well-known dead zone. The only arcane tower in the area was reported destroyed over 600 years before in the civil war that ended the western empire. The mercenaries (a wizard of unknown race and two dragonborn: a sorcerer and a cleric of [[Old Gods|Pealar]]) passed through the [[Iron Dominions]] on merchant visas and immediately headed for the Nocthis Pass. They vanished into Nocthian custody before anyone from the Organization could arrive to question them. All attempts to find the tower failed.

Two weeks later, all hell broke loose. Quite literally. All high-ranking clerics were awakened by their gods, warning them that something *huge* had levered itself up out of the abyss, casually munching on an entire devil army on the way out. It entered our reality on the western edge of the continent with an aetheric shock that stunned every half-way competent mage over half the world. And then it vanished. Not a ripple left behind. Within an hour, the forces sent to watch the orc tribes reported in. The orcs were gone. Every single member of all known tribes had vanished as if by teleport gate. Those watching the goblins, the ogres, the giants—all said the same. Every malign and malicious creature of the world had vanished at one instant.

The next day, we lost Imperial Meztli. A tidal wave of vicious creatures, led by a robed figure riding a dracolich had annihilated the defenders of the major cities simultaneously. The scattered reports that came in after that said that the survivors were being used as food, labor, or sacrifices. Or worse. Within two days, all contact was lost. Scrying spells no longer worked in that area.

The battle for the Iron Dominions lasted a couple of days. There were no survivors. Nocthis closed the passes with landslides and came under siege, but has so far held out. A full week passed without further contact with the enemy. All scouting operations and scrying attempts failed. The enemy’s numbers, organization, leadership—all unknown.

After Meztli fell the Council started alerting the nations and gathering the heroes of the realm. Various forces were sent on missions to gather aid (and to get them to somewhat safer territory). These include…

Scribe’s note: at this point the manuscript was damaged by what appear to have been rats. The reconstructed fragments talk of several parties, including one sent on a fool’s errand to recover the Eye of Qa’desh, a rumored artifact capable of reshaping reality. No one expected them to find anything. The next legible text begins…

And we are losing. Badly. There are multiple armies of them, growing each day. Even bolstered by angels, devils, mythic heroes and great wyrms, our forces can barely hold them back. Refugees are streaming south toward the Ikolorn mountains, hoping in vain to find safety.

''More damaged pages, fewer this time, but the text has been intermittently damaged. Such damaged portions are marked by ellipses.''

...gathered for the final battle. All our forces are committed. No reserves. Here, in the valley of Har Keddo, with the Great Tree at our backs, we will fight. And die. Our only hope is to delay the enemy enough for some of the refugees to hide.

We finally know who we are fighting. The archmage [[Porolondorola]], thought killed in the Final War of the Western Empire had contracted with a demon to take him and his tower out of time. Once he returned, he contracted with the [[Nameless]] and allowed It to possess him. That was the force that came out of the [[Abyss]]. The enemy of the Dawn War. The Dark Titan, against which all the Primal Gods fought. Our only consolation is that he is stuffed into the flesh of a man[…]

they found the Eye! Contact was lost soon after. Maybe we have a chance! […]It was them. The same ones that awakened [[Porolondorola]] were sent after the Eye. If they try to use it, all creation is doomed[…].

''The rest of the document is damaged beyond repair.''

      <text bytes="2201" sha1="b4jtoyhfyya3fm05uborzdh8qg0yqxc" xml:space="preserve">Master Thorngage Bree was one of the two Agriculture Guild representatives on the Council from 190 AC until the fall of the Council after the [[Crystal Spire War]. She was one of the [[Guildmasters]] who attempted a coup in 227 AC and was assassinated as retribution for the injury caused to [[Marcia (Dragon)|Marcialline the dragon]]. She was the head of the Apiary Alliance, which is responsible for the production of honey as well as the pollination of all bee-dependent agricultural products. This is one of the smaller Alliances, but easily in the top three for wealth produced. Her alliance is almost entirely halfling as well, since most wall-builders are allergic to bee stings. This makes her the de facto [[halfling]] representative on the Council as well.

Master Bree is intensely conservative and hates change. Especially if that change involves less wealth and power for her people. She strongly opposed the [[Federated Nations]] treaty and stayed opposed to trade with other nations. Her family is one of the most wide-spread, boasting 37 branches across the [[Sea of Grass]] region. It has also been there since before the [[Cataclysm]], a fact about which she boasts frequently. A devout follower of [[Loran Hae]], she wears holy symbols constantly and obviously.

;Demographic Information: In 211 AC, Thorngage was an older (late 50s) Stout halfling woman. Like many halflings, she was plump and red-cheeked, while still being agile. She had multiple husbands and produced 25 children, including 5 males. She wore finely woven dresses dyed in lavish colors; her grey hair is usually tied up in a bun. She wielded a cane fiercely, but otherwise is a commoner mechanically.

;Personality Trait: I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen.

;Ideal: Stability. Every change should be carefully measured and monitored and only undertaken when there’s no risk of failure.

;Bond: My family is the most important thing to me; I will do anything to protect it.

;Flaw: I’ve become accustomed to the fine things in life and spend quite a sum on them.

;Alignment: Lawful Neutral

==The Eyes of Qa'desh: Fantasy, Myth, or Just Plain Lie?==
''The author's biases come through strongly even from the title.''

Myths about twin artifacts known as the Eyes of Qa'desh are widespread[1-12]. Some claim that they are crystalline, faceted gemstones the size of a man's head, and that each contains a great golden eye with a slitted pupil. This is not implausible. Such large, magically-imbued chunks of [[magicite]] are well within the capabilities of most significant magical powers even today[14, 27], much less the savants of the 2nd age. No, what are outrageous are the claims about the powers[1,4, 11] attributed to them. In interests of fairness [hah!], I will examine these claims in more detail before setting the record straight.

===Claim 1: The Origin and Purpose of the Left Eye===
Zarkad of Erak claims[4] that the Left Eye (distinguished[17] by noting that the iris is red-orange instead of true gold) of Qa'desh is a piece of the One, the Dreamer who created[98] [[Quartus]] and the entire [[Crystal Sphere]] in which it swims. Setting aside the blatant impossibility of this claim, the One has never been determined to have any particular shape, let alone one with conveniently dragon-sized eyes. Not to mention all the numerous other relics[54] said to be pieces of this being--such a chimera would be most monstrous if it contained all those parts!

Further, Zarkad claims[5] that the Left Eye is imbued with the unmatched power to destroy matter. He claims that the Left Eye was used by the [[titans]] and [[wyrm]], working together (what rubbish!) to separate what is now [[Oelfra]] from the bedrock, so that it could be floated west after the First Wish. If this were true (which it isn't), the amount of anima consumed would be colossal. To the point that magic as we know it would no longer function! And no [[magicite]] is so pure as to withstand those forces. My esteemed colleague Ke'lasha (to her everlasting discredit, a shame for such a fine researcher) concurs with the fool Zarkad, and even goes further to claim that it was used again by the [[aelvar]] survivors after [[Moon's Fall]] to split [[Soefra]] off. Titans and wyrm are one thing, but aelves are merely our ancestors. As powerful as they were, such a feat as moving a continent is surely beyond even their knowledge.

And if such claims had even the slightest amount of credence, surely such a powerful artifact would have been kept somewhere safe and more recent written records would remain of its use. Yet none do. In fact, the earliest legends[1, 2] claim that the Eyes, once used, vanish for centuries at a time, supposedly "awaiting the will of the [[Great Mechanism]]" (which is rubbish, as the Great Mechanism has no will!) for their return.

Some rumors state[15] that the Left Eye is located in the jungle at the southern tip of western [[Noefra]], in a long-lost temple to a long-dead goddess of fate and luck. Balderdash. That jungle is intensely hostile to anything constructed. No temple could survive a month without upkeep (and who would be its priest? An ape?), let alone aeons. And even (perish the thought) if that were possible, it would have been found by some pesky adventurer (or detachment from the old Western Empire). The fact that it's still just a rumor, a legend, means that it can't be true.

''Contrary to the author's claim in this last paragraph, the Left Eye was, in fact, located in that temple in what is now known as the [[Blood-thirst Wildlands]]. Nothing remains of it, as that was the epicenter of the event known now as the [[Cataclysm]]. Three fool-hardy adventurers (now known as the [[Divine Three]] were sent there chasing rainbows in the days immediately preceding the [[Battle of Acceptance]], when the [[Nameless]] had returned to consume all creation. There they found the Left Eye (and reported back to headquarters, which is how we know that this occurred) and proceeded to invoke its power. No history records exactly what they thought they were trying to accomplish, but we all know the results of even (what seems to be) a partial activation. The immediate vicinity of the temple was completely exhausted of available anima; even the rocks were reduced to sand as their anima was drained. A substantial fraction of the world's anima was drained and backfed into the elemental conduits, which threatened to misalign the planes themselves. The [[Great Mechanism]] had to absorb the essence of the remaining gods to fix the problem, and thus the familiar consequences ensued--natural disasters from elemental misalignment (even for an instant) and the stoppage of all magic for 50 years until the anima levels could recover and new gods be appointed. What happened to the Eye after that is unknown.''

===Claim 2: The Origin and Purpose of the Right Eye===
Having considered the so-called "Left Eye", now let's turn to the Right one. Much of the discussion is the same, although from different authors--Lai Scholar Po[2,6,9] is the main name on this absurdity. They agree[2] on the origins (no matter how impossible that claim), and claim that the Right Eye holds the power of creation. That while the Left Eye was used to cut the continents of [[Soefra]] and [[Oelfra]] free of the primal super-continent, the Right Eye was used to move them and affix them back in place once they reached their destinations. Poppycock. As my esteemed colleague Jana showed, the motion of the continents was the clear result of moving plates of stone floating on the lava at the core of [[Quartus]], and the tribes merely migrated and were separated over the centuries. 

Unlike the Left Eye, there are no rumors of the Right Eye's location. Lai Po also claims that the Right Eye, even when inactive, alters the lives of those nearby (and so the Right Eye had to be kept from any kind of settled area, lest it irrevocably warp the people). A likely story to hide the fact that no one has ever reported such an object in existence.

''The remainder of this screed has been removed from this publication, as it grows progressively more wild and fanciful. Plates of stone floating on lava? Tiny particles of matter that can't be divided and have intrinsic properties (rather than being condensed, aspected anima)? The causes of disease being tiny living things that invade (rather than emanations of befouled aether)? To quote the author--poppycock!''

Travelers in the [[astral]] commonly report seeing gigantic tubes (like veins) or gears, wires, or other such structures throughout that plane. In fact, dwellers in the astral use those conduits as transportation mechanisms.

The Great Mechanism is centered in the [[Celestial City]]. It does not have a will; instead it has directives. Some have been altered by the [[Great Wishes]]; others remain from the [[Dawn War]]. The primary directives can be summarized as follows:

#Sustain the Dream.
#Ward off the [[Awakener]].
#Nurture life.
#Only mortality produces power.
#All that lives must one day die.

When the Mechanism requires an interface with individuals, it speaks through the only four [[Old Gods]] to have survived, the [[Golden Aspects]] (although their wills were absorbed and they act as extensions of the Mechanism). This is incredibly rare, however.

      <text bytes="11115" sha1="l0y9t0cp759mknktgnm8p5otidnnyy5" xml:space="preserve">Devils. Infernals. Lucians. The Families. Their names are many. Who are they? What do they want? Are they evil?

==If not evil, then what?==
A major part of Quartus (especially since the end of the 3rd Age) is that no creature is condemned to be evil or good--all have choice. This includes the natives of the [[Astral]] Plane, including angels and devils. If that's so, why are angels and devils different? How are they different from [[demigods]] and other members of the [[Divine Rank|Choir Divine]]? It all comes down to their source of anima and their concomitant duties.

==Devils--Contractors to the Gods==
By decree from the [[Great Mechanism]], the direct intervention of the [[Congregation]] on Quartus is severely limited--in most cases to cryptic dreams and visions, as well as granting spells to their faithful clergy. This mostly works well, keeping the mortals free to live their lives. But what if the gods need a more hands-on approach? What if a devout follower asks for a servant to aid them in the pursuit of the god's interests? That's where the devils come in. They are allowed (by virtue of their lesser connection to the [[Great Mechanism]]) to take on material forms and descend to the mortal plane, to be summoned and commanded by mortals. In return, the god on whose behalf they're acting pays a portion of anima. In principle, this is a fair wage, compensating the devil for its time, trouble, and risk. In practice, this payment is starvation wages for the bulk of the infernal population. It's enough to survive, but not enough to gain strength.  

==Fiendish Hierarchy==
In reaction to this order of things, the fiends organized themselves into [[Diabolical Families|families]]. Each one specializes in a particular type of intervention and protects that metaphysical turf from any challengers. There are 45 families, organized into 5 territories. Each family is headed by a Don, territories are handled by a council of Dons and represent related jobs. When picturing these families, imagine a cross between the Mafia, the Yakuza, and unions. Some are more formally organized and lawful; others are held together by main force and an understanding that however much they hate each other, they hate the world outside even more. Not all Dons are individually powerful--at least one family is headed by an imp who happens to have dirt on many other members and is a tremendously effective organizer. Most are powerful though or have the personal allegiance of some powerful individuals.

Most families are organized as follows (although the details vary tremendously). Each rank below the dons has a particular infix that they use, placed between the personal use-name and the family name.

;The Don: Head of the family, from which it takes its name.
;Underboss: 1-2 per Don, their most (and least) trusted subordinates. Often they do much of the day-to-day work. They use the infix 'seka'.
;Lieutenants/Caporegime: The right-hand fiends to the underbosses. They don't directly control territory but act as enforcers and overseers. Their infix is 'aka' or 'ka'
;Brigadiers: These control sub-elements of the population and pay tribute to the Don. They're the equivalent of dukes. They use 'yol' or 'al' as their infix.
;Bratoki: These fiends control a squad of associates and report to a Brigadier. They use 'bal' like the associates, but are generally bigger or stronger or smarter than their lesser kin.
;Associates: These are the foot-soldiers and the lowest rank other than commoners. Infix is 'bal'
;Commoners: These poor fiends are the masses. Most of them are on the astral dole and pay "insurance" to the local bosses. They don't use an infix, and usually don't use a family name.
;Specialists : These have particular capabilities or are otherwise set apart from the hierarchy. Generally they're treated like bratoki or brigadiers. They use 'il' or 'vel' as their infix.

==What makes up the difference?==
Devils are hungry for more anima--after all, they can't grow without a steady supply of it. The divine dole is enough to survive, but that's it. The rest must come from mortals. Unlike demons who devour souls, devils make contracts for a sip of anima at a time. What are these contracts? It depends on the class of devil. Minor devils do odd jobs--a summon here, a cursing there, a bit of information on the other side. They usually aren't directly contacted--they work through their bosses and are delegated tasks. In return, they pay a large portion of their take upward. They usually don't deal with the same summoner time and again--they go where called. Intelligent fiends like imps often seek out masters willing to give them steady work. The downside to those lasting contracts is risk--see the portion about summoning.

Middle-weight fiends have ongoing contracts--are on retainer so to speak. They're called upon to act as muscle, consulted for information, or otherwise handle bigger jobs, usually for the same set of mortal "masters." Larger fiends can build protections into their summoning contracts, mitigating much (but not all!) of the risk.

Major fiends tend to act as administrators, doling out work and receiving the lion's share of the payment. Most of their efforts go to holding off their competitors within the families. Very few of these are ever seen outside the Astral plane.

==Shapes and Sizes==
Being creatures of diffuse anima, devils have no intrinsic shape or gender. In fact, the difference between a fiend and an angel is only one of order--the nimbus of a true angel is unchanging and fixed, while that of a devil is opalescent and ever-shifting. To mortal eyes, both tend to appear as androgynous humanoids of nearly identical proportions. Their nimbuses show the identifying marks of their family (or legion, for angels) and rank.

When summoned, however, Astral entities must don a puppet-body of flesh to interact with the mortal world. The shapes of these bodies are set by the summoning contract--bodies of celestial mien when working for the Gods, more fearsome visages when working for mortals (especially in a combat role). Most of these bodies are traditional--like wearing a cultural costume for tourists. The devils take as large a body as their personal anima allows.

==Contracts and Summoning==
Fiends can enter the mortal plane in one of three ways--

'''On contract with a god or ascendant'''. Here there is very little risk and very little direct interaction with mortals. The devil appears, performs the task (usually invisible to normal mortals), and returns home. On the rare occasions that they have to be visible, they take on ordinary appearances as a matter of course. They can always be caught out by their nimbuses which are too smooth and opaque to be mortal. In the extremely rare cases when they have to appear as outsiders they appear as avatars of the god that sent them (with appearance based on the god's objectives).

'''Summoned in accordance with a contract'''. Here the shape and role depends on the contract (as mentioned above). The cost of such contracts is measured in soul-year-equivalents (SYE): one SYE is the amount of excess anima produced by an average human over the course of one year. Losing that much would leave a normal human weakened for several weeks and overall costs about a month of life-span. People with more personal power than that can handle the stress just fine without weakening them much. One SYE will get you a few hours of service (or the equivalent) from a low-middling devil. Ongoing contracts allow the devil to tap the contractor for much smaller amounts of anima periodically (a credit account, so to speak). These contracts are reasonably low-risk for the devil--the standard contract contains an escape clause allowing the devil to return home when defeat is inescapable but before the devil's own anima is at risk. Lesser devils that make long-term-residence contracts (like a wizard's imp familiar) gain a constant source of anima and can grow powerful very quickly (in astral terms anyway) but run significant risks. They can retreat into their astral pocket on sustaining substantial damage; however, if the master is killed while they are tucked away the pocket collapses and the fiend is destroyed.

'''Directly through a portal'''. This is the only way the major devils can enter this world, as no caster can pay the cost required to give them a fitting body. Opening such a portal usually requires either major magic (''gate'' or the equivalent) or the sacrifice of several adult mortals (willing or otherwise). This is also extremely risky for the devil--if they are killed before being able to ''planeshift'' out, they're dead permanently. As a result, this happens extremely rarely.

The scruples of fiends vary considerably--some will not accept compelled contracts and are very choosy about how they fulfill their contracts; others are less picky and will take anything that comes along. Some won't accept orders that would cause collateral damage; others revel in destruction. Some are loyal to their masters and their contracts; others are more mercenary. If you're thinking of summoning a fiend, make sure you do your research first.

It is also the lowest point in Western [[Noefra]]. Many rivers empty into the lake, but none exit. Even so, it is still fresh water. The density of elemental energy suggests that a major portal to the [[Plane of Ocean]] can be found at the deepest part of the lake, but none have been so fool-hardy as to go looking for it.

      <text bytes="5999" sha1="j30k5r5o791r2kmxv904t1d3uo3vfat" xml:space="preserve">Created at about the same time as humans, the orcs were born of hobgoblin stock, modified by animal souls, especially those of dire boars. They inherited from their porcine soul donors resilient constitution; from their hobgoblin ancestors they gained reason and language. During the Interregnum, they and the [[ihmisi]] fought side by side against the [[humans]] and [[gwerin]] forces in the endless squabbles and raids that characterized that era. 

Until the coming of the [[Red Fang]] and his reign of blood and terror. Insatiable in his appetites while in mortal form, he was an ancestor to most living orcs today. And his curse of demonic rage bred true. Throughout the Third Age, the orcish people labored under this bloodthirst, this insensate rage. The only saving grace, the only thing that kept the tribes and hordes from destroying themselves in paroxysms of violence, was that the women were spared the worst of the rage. Was it the influence of Serak, Gromash's (the mortal name of the [[Red Fang]]) twin? Was it a blessing from the gods? Or just a quirk of fate? No one knows. All that is known is that the women took up the mantle of command. The men led the war and hunting, slaking their thirst for blood on other beings, while the women were the chiefs and shamans, holding the tribes together and reigning in the menfolk. This is not to say that the women were immune to the blood rage. Merely that they were better equipped to think rationally despite it.

As a result, they were shunned by most "civilized" folk and considered demonic, evil, little better than unreasoning beasts. They were pushed to the outskirts, the unwanted places, where they lived in tribes and by raiding, hunting, and (occasionally) acting as mercenaries. Until the [[Cataclysm]]. When the [[Nameless]] was freed, it sought out the "monstrous" races, chief among them the orcs. With their ancestor, now fully demonic, exerting his will on them, the orcs throughout [[Noefra]] fell completely under the sway of the forces of Chaos. As one, willing or not, they took up arms and began to march on the people of Order. They formed the bulk of its forces during the [[Cataclysm War]]. Truth be told, many of them saw it as their opportunity to take revenge on the peoples that had slighted them, persecuted them, slaughtered them. Racial grudges have long, but selective memories. Others joined under duress, swept away by the red tide of the [[Red Fang]]'s anger, hate, and lust.

After the war, the surviving orcs in western [[Noefra]] retreated to the north, to the forests of [[Kotimaa]]. Broken, they reformed tribes and survived. But something had changed. With the Acceptance of change, their rage was transformed. No longer purely destructive, it could be channeled...if they so choose. Some do choose the path of discipline; others still glory in the red haze. The women still form the backbone of the tribes, being resistant to the blood rage even in its weakened form.

==Current Times==
Orcs have integrated successfully into the cultures of the [[Federated Nations]]. Their primary place of residence is [[Wyrmhold]], where they make up about 1/3 of the population, especially in northern regions. Many wild tribes still stalk [[Kotimaa]], living in and among the ruins of the cities that once dotted that land. A few tribes live in the [[Dreamwall Mountains]], hidden away from the rest of civilization.

The other significant group of orcish peoples in western [[Noefra]] are those that dwell along the [[Lost Coast]]. Not all the armies of chaos found their way to the final battle at [[Pactum Battlefield]]. Elements and companies stayed behind to subjugate the [[Iron Dominions]] and [[Imperial Meztli]]. After the [[Cataclysm]], subjugators and subjugated interbred heavily in many areas. Pockets of pure orcish or human groups still remain, but most have at least some mixed blood.

==Cultures==
===Wyrmhold===
The orcs of [[Wyrmhold]] are known for their honor, discipline, and strength. Descended from the four tribes that joined the [[dragonborn]] due to a prophetic vision, they were tempered in the war against the [[Hungering Frost]]. Now 40 years after the end of that war, they have retained a culture that glorifies strength and battle. The most expansionist of the citizens of [[Wyrmhold]] are found among the orcish tribes. Their primary targets (held back by political concerns) are the other tribes of [[Kotimaa]] (whom they have raided and been raided by for generations) and the [[Horse Clans]] who, as they see it, are wasting all that prime prairie land.

There is a split growing, however--while [[Tabar]] still dreams of glory in battle, [[Kard]] wishes victory through technology and trade. [[Ko]], always the least settled tribe, has drifted even further away. And [[Skem]], as always, keeps its council close and secret.

===Duarchy===
Civilized orcs in the [[Duarchy of Kotimaa]] are concentrated mostly in [[Godsfall]]. The so-called [[Hellbred]] orcs, whose ancestors were trapped in the city along with the rest of their army and twisted by demonic machinations, are city dwellers. They have urbanized tremendously. Their civilized mannerisms belie their ferocious appearance. That isn't to say that they're not violent at times. Their rage still burns, but most have sublimated it towards domination via trade and other non-physical means. Other notable tribes include the [[Watching Eye]], who consider themselves the guardians of the ruins and relics left behind by earlier ages.   

===Wild Orcs===
Many tribes of "wild" orcs, not affiliated with any nation, dwell in western [[Noefra]]. The largest populations are in the [[Kotimaa|Kotimaan]] forests north of [[Lake Coy'in]] as well as into the peninsula region. One notable tribe is that of the [[Grey Eagle]].

===Eastern Noefran orcs===
It is believed that many orcs still remain in the eastern lands. But no contact has been had with them since the [[Cataclysm]].

      <text bytes="1518" sha1="jmvk44bq4r1xvk8vae5o1pfazs2cdpa" xml:space="preserve">The name given to the major followers of the [[Nameless]] during the [[Dawn War]]. These immortal beings were incarnations of concepts, alien to mortals in mindset and goals. When they fell, those incarnations were shattered, broken. Cast into the [[Abyss]] with their leader, they existed for eons. Occasionally, they would leak (or be summoned) into the [[mortal]] plane. This inevitably wrought havoc as nature fought back. In sufficient density, their presence would even serve to break portions free of the flow of space and time, creating unstable pockets of altered reality. These were the original demons. Unlike modern demons, they did not need to subsist on mortal souls--they were self-empowered. 

In smaller-scale events, Concepts would form mortal incarnations, as if wearing a meat-puppet (of incredible power). These incarnations could be fought and destroyed; the Concept could not (antedating the planes themselves). At the [[Cataclysm]], the sacrifice of the [[Unbroken]] served to bridge the gap, accepting the majority of the Broken Concepts back into full alignment. As such, very few Concepts remain (although their diminished incarnations are still a threat in some areas).

==Known Incarnations==
; Causality: See [[Kel'dan]]. Redeemed--now known as the [[Archon of Time]]
; Order: Used to preserve the [[Titan Conclave]]. Wielded and manipulated by [[Isskap]] before her destruction in 212 AC.
; Hunger: See [[Shelob]]. Destroyed by the [[Godsfall Champions]] in 210 AC.

      <text bytes="8606" sha1="k4zcppsscg0vm22smtbwmk27l8owoqs" xml:space="preserve">One of the [[Successor States]], occupying the regions of [[Dreamshore]] and [[Kotimaa]].

==Major Cities==
* [[Godsfall]] (capital of Kotimaa)
* [[Baile Craan]] (capital of Dreamshore)
* [[Rabbiton]]

==Economics==
; Exports/major production: wood products, fruits, wool, artifacts, leather/fur
; Imports: grains, spices, dyes, worked metal

==Government==
Two equal leaders, one for each region. Kotimaa is a racially-federal republic, while Dreamshore is a feudal semi-federal state. 

===Layers===
The top layer of the government are the Duarchs--two individuals (one from each region) who serve as the chief executives and moderators. The Kotimaan duarch is also the Chancellor; the Dreamshore duarch is the reigning Lord/Lady.
====Kotimaa====
The highest level of the Kotimaan government is the [[Parliament of Free Peoples]]. It has 3 representatives from each of the racial and factional groups (listed below) and elects a Chancellor to serve as the executive. The Chancellor has a veto, but otherwise does not vote. The parliament is also the supreme judiciary committee.

Below the Parliament are the individual factions that have seats. Each one has a different method of selecting their representatives. Also noted for each one is their location and major political leaning. Expansionist groups want to grow, conquer, and increase their interactions with other nations and peoples; the Isolationists want to stay independent of and unaffected by other nations and want to focus on building inward strength rather than pushing the borders of civilization. Currently there is a relative balance, with Isolationism slightly dominant.

The current Chancellor is [[Iseis]], formerly of the [[Godsfall Champions]].

====Dreamshore====
The region of [[Dreamshore]] has much less racial and factional diversity. After the [[Guildmasters]] plot, the citizens of Dreamshore formed feudal territories under notable wealthy individuals and land-owners. They selected Lady [[Coldwind]] as their unifying leader, much to her chagrin and over her strenuous objections. Most of the power still rests in the feudal nobles, however. 
; Council of Nobles: The dukes (a total of 6), Lady [[Coldwind]], and the lord-mayor of [[Baile Craan]]. They are the main "legislative" body, although they mostly coordinate between the dukes (who represent their vassals as well as their own interests).
;The Six Dukes : each of these nobles is, in effect, a king. They claim areas of the nation and then delegate partial control to lesser nobles
* Duke Eastmountain ([[Eastmountain Duchy]]): The least "real" of the duchies, this family was chosen by the free mountain clans and villages stretching from [[Baile Craan]] east to the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] to be their representative. The current Eastmountain is a middle-aged human woman whose primary objective is to puncture the inflated egos of the other nobles.
* Duke Eastwalk ([[Eastwalk Dutchy]]): Ruling over the plains in the south-east sector (east of the last river but north of the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]] border, Eastwalk is a highly conservative human male. It's believed that he has strong ties to the Republic.
* Duke Farthingale ([[Farthingale Duchy]]): Of the Bradavon Farthingale halfling clan, Duke [[Rakel Farthingale]] is a classic halfling matron. Arch conservative (especially where gender roles are concerned), extremely dismissive of all males, extremely religious. Her family's wealth comes from the apiaries which supply much of the region with honey. Her heir was [[Nyx Astra]] until she fled after being accused of participating in the destruction of the [[Cherry Blossom Temple]]. 
* Duke Pactum ([[Pactum Duchy]]) Least conventionally religious of all of the dukes. Has strong ties with [[Pactum Grove]]. Human female, early 20s (attained her majority only two years ago taking over from a regent after her parents died in an accident).
* Duke Rabbit Lake ([[Elfhame Duchy]]): Most people call her a pirate. [[Rabbiton]] is home to sailors, fishermen, and unsavory folks, as well as heavy mixing with Kotimaa proper. Half-elf (earthblood), middle aged. A striking beauty, except for her foul mouth and scars.
* Duke Westmountain ([[Westmountain Duchy]]): The other "mountain" duke is an oddity. He's a half-orc who won his position by outthinking his competitors. Extremely non-traditional, he rules very lightly and is working to increase industry (especially mining and logging) in his area.

;The Yarls : each of these nobles controls a county with one or two significant towns and the surrounding villages.
* Yarl Westmarch. An [[ihmisi]] woman who holds court from an [[ihmisi]] village on the edge of the woods. Not too concerned with what's going on outside the [[ihmisi]]-claimed woods.
* Yarl Goldmountain. A dwarven man, one of the elders of a lesser dwarven clan in the [[Westmountain Duchy]]. Mining focused. Only very lightly supervises his non-dwarven barons.
* Yarl Lillian Farthingale (of the Bradford Farthingales, not the main line). Rules over Bradford and its wool trade. Devoted to [[Sakara]] and the patron of the [[Cherry Blossom Temple]] nearby. A kindly, but elderly woman, she's relatively progressive when it comes to gender roles. Killed in the destruction of the temple by raiders in 250 AC. County Bradford currently ruled by [[Betsy Farthingale|Betsy Farthingale-Azur]].

; The Barons : each of these control a barony with a few villages.
* Baron Sumpter : rules [[Cragdale]] and [[Honedaxe]]. Answers directly to Yarl Goldmountain and then to Duke Westmountain. Made his fortune by inventing a better suspension for carriages and owns a significant interest in the Dreampost, a fast-courier service that runs coaches with mail and people throughout the area. Bought his title from the previous Baron who had fallen desperately in debt, in part due to penalties levied against his bastard son.
* Baron Silverpeak : A courtesy title without lands. Related to Duke Eastwalk, but spends his time in [[Baile Craan]] looking after his commercial interests in the hauling business.
* Baron Nyx Astra : An assumed name, her real name is Nyxianalara-lee Rumptwist (of the Bradavon Rumptwists). She's an aggressive, power-hungry young female halfling who made her name in repelling ogre-kin raids on the eastern frontier and has been adopted into the Farthingale clan as the next heir (since the rest of the Bradavon Farthingales are unmitigated nitwits). Exiled after the destruction of [[Cherry Blossom Temple]] and then later killed by her estranged husband [[Tsun Azur]] during her assault on the dragon graveyard in the [[Dragonreach]].

==Demographics==
===Kotimaa===
* Orcs (tribal and hell-bred) 45%
* puun ihmisia 40%
* humans (wall-builder) 10%
* sher-ka &amp; shifters 3%
* Other 2%

Population Distribution:
* Godsfall ~20k
* Rabbiton ~6k
* villages ~30k
* tribal  ~50k

===Dreamshore===
* wall-builder humans 60%
* wall-builder halflings 35%
* puun ihmisia 5%

Population Distribution
* Cities: 30k
* Towns and villages: 90k
* Rural/pastoral: 30k

==Religion==
Mostly kami-based in Kotimaa proper, although there's heavy ecumenical Congregation-worship in Godsfall.

Dreamshore is a mix--many of the wall-builders still follow the [[Seasonal Four]] but are no longer in full communion with the Temple at [[Kaelthia]]. Others have drifted into syncretic mixes of congregation worship, kami propitiation, and ancestor veneration, especially among the mountain folk.

==Culture==
* Highly individualistic/family based.
* not particularly coherent as a nation, mostly just united against outsiders (especially [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]])

A godless land, Byssia is home to the most powerful druids and elementalists, as well as the worshipers of [[Nocthis]]. They've started to expand through the [[Tunnel of the Ancestors]] into the Caldera, the original home of the night's children.

==Government==
* Multiple layers of elected judges; legislative power is minimal (except at local level).
* Heavily village-based.
* Villages select a judge, groups of village judges select (by region) a couple of senior judges. Senior judges select the High Judge.
* High Judge, along with Prime Mysteriarch of [[Nocthis]], a druidic representative, and a representative of the [[Home of the Elements]] preside over the nation.
* Large changes in policy get referred to general referendum.

==Peoples==
* Night's children humans (35%)
* Night's children half-elves (30%)
* puun ihmisia (30%)
* others (goblins in the east, refugee humans in the west) (5%)

==Religion==
* Plurality of night's children are devotees of the [[Church of Night Reborn]].
* Remainder worship the [[Honored Ancestors]] and revere the [[kami]].
* puun ihmisia and refugees revere the kami.
* very very few worshipers of the [[Congregation]]

==Culture==
* community-focused &amp; democratic (at the local level)
* strong resistance to imposition of authority
* distrust of non-druidic divine magic. Elemental focus.
* disdain for gods and god-worshipers. 
* in touch with the land
* very little metal use.
* heavily maritime on [[Gap-tooth Bay]].

==Capital==
See [[Byss]].

==Economy==
;Exports: Spices, dyes, cotton, rice. Fish. [[Ironwood]] products.
;Imports: metal, silk, non-fish meat.

==International relationships==
* Considered backward and stuck in the mud by [[Wyrmhold]]. They've had conflicts over the [[Nocthian Caldera]] in the past.
* Considered a back-water by most other nations.
* [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]] uses them as a propaganda point about "godless heathens" being cursed to poverty.

Arising in the wake of the liberation of [[Godsfall]] in 211 AC, the Redeeming Blades are the ascendant beings embodying the concept of redemption and forgiveness, serving [[Melara]], the Lady of Mercy. Seen both as two beings (one human, one angelic, both female) and one being of ambiguous (although humanoid) form, the Blades preach that even the most sinful person may be cleansed and reborn free from that taint...at a price.  

===Life and Fall===
In the time before the [[Cataclysm War]], the previous god of redemption, atonement, and rebirth, [[Old Gods|Maelek]] maintained a tower/temple in [[Godsfall]]. Here, his priests and followers purified repentant sinners. Those that sought forgiveness would bring sacrifices to the temple. While for minor sins these were merely monetary (which money was given to the poor), those guilty of major sins gave up everything. Their path to redemption started in the great hall--penitents, stripped of all their worldly possessions, rank, and even name fell into ritual pool in the basement, where they were washed clean of their prior self. Having forgotten all of who they were except their sin, they slowly climbed up the tower, stopping at different stages to reflect and repent until their old sins fell away and they were reborn to a new personality.

This process was overseen by the High Priestess, who at the time of the [[Cataclysm]] was a human woman known as Viltis. A woman of great faith and personal power, she also had many enemies (those who refused to accept that the penitents she sheltered were truly forgiven). To protect her and her work, Maelek sent a servant, the deva known as Dezhuura. While not one of the [[angels|Angelic Host]], she was similar in stature and obedience to duty. In time, the forgiving Viltis and the unbending Dezhuura became friends...and then more. The pair served among the leaders of [[Godsfall]]

Then came the [[Cataclysm War]]. As the chaotic legions marched closer, [[Kul'Asad]] sent his agents to infiltrate Maelek's Tower and bring down Viltis from within. Taking the form of Viltis, they deceived Dezhuura into believing her a traitor and a demon-worshiper. Betrayed and despairing, Dezhuura confronted her lover in her chambers at the top of the tower and plunged her blade [[Redemption]] into her breast. As she died, Viltis's last words were forgiveness and love. Realizing she had been deceived and had betrayed her duty and her god, Dezhuura cracked. Summoning an avatar of her god, she condemned the tower and all of its inhabitants to an eternal cycle of death and rebirth, unable to permanently die but forever suffering. Driven completely mad, she spent the next two hundred years alternating between flying endless grieving circles around the tower and torturing the cultists who deceived her while Viltis's body remained impaled by [[Redemption]] and Maelek's avatar remained chained, his tears and blood powering this unholy abomination of a ritual.

After the ritual that turned [[Godsfall]] into a prison for [[Kel'dan]] and the army of chaos, [[Kul'Asad]] tapped the endless font of energy of Maelek's Tower as a beacon for his temporal machinations, letting his [[seers]] find their way home through time and space wherever they went. His army prevented any other group from approaching the tower and disturbing the situation there.

===Liberation and Rebirth===
In 211 AC, as part of the [[Godsfall Liberation (Campaign)|liberation of Godsfall]], the [[Godsfall Champions]] entered the tower from below (with [[Isshin]]'s help). Progressing through the tower, they discovered that Viltis had foreseen this betrayal and had put aside an artifact of resurrection. With this artifact and the help of Maelek's avatar (revealed to be Maelek itself), they raised her from the dead and redeemed Dezhuura through Viltis's love.

As a last act of divine grace, Maelek granted them his remaining power and Melara accepted them as Her ascended servants. Thus the Redeeming Blades were born. [[Redemption]] itself was cast aside, taking into itself the grief and guilt of the murder of Viltis. It has since passed into Shadow and taken on a life of its own.

==Tenets==
The Blades preach that all that sin may be forgiven and reborn through sacrifice. An organization of followers (clerics of Melara, paladins, and other devoted souls) has sprung up throughout Noefra. Headquartered in [[Godsfall]] (although not at Maelek's Tower), the Blade-bearers seek out repentant sinners throughout the land. Those that are truly penitent give up all the benefits of their crimes and are washed clean by forgetfulness and rebirth. Minor sins only require the rewriting of part of one's personality; major sins require the death of the person-that-was and a complete rebirth as a new person.

This process requires sincere penitence. Those that try to cheat and shortcut the process die in excruciating agony as their minds and souls are ripped asunder on the holy blades.

===Legal Status of the Reborn===
In the [[Duarchy of Kotimaa]] and the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]], total rebirth is legally equivalent to a death sentence. The reborn person is not held to account for the sins or crimes of the person-that-was, but cannot also inherit any status or goods of the prior self. Lesser rebirths are often carried out as part of a sentence for those that have truly repented. Other nations do not necessarily absolve the reborn of all consequences of their crimes.

With an orbital period of only 44 days, the planet passes through the influence of each of the four elements in 11 days each. As a result (and as a result of the extreme elemental energies that close to Eua), the seasons are incredibly violent. Approximately the size of Mercury (~ 0.05 Quartus-masses and about 11% of the radius of Quartus), it has a mean density of about 8.0 kg/m^3. All sorts of materials unique to that conflux of elemental energies are found there. Beings from the various elemental planes and the [[astral]] visit Primus in search of particularly rare and powerful materials.

Touched by the [[Great Mechanism]], this being was raised up to become an adjunct to the Mechanism itself. Responsible for maintaining the temporal order and preventing any more time-travel shenanigans, as well as repairing the damage caused by [[concept bombs]] throughout history, the Archon is godlike in power but separate from the [[Congregation]]. As a side effect of her ascension, prophecy and augury are now operative forces (although only seeing potentials in a fluid future rather than fixed fates).

The conflict between these two forces encysts a region of the Mortal plane in a time-warped bubble, cutting it free of the rest of the flow of time and space. To those outside this region, it is as if the affected are just vanishes as if it never existed. This is a "concept bomb". The effects inside the affected region vary depending on exactly which Concept was summoned but range from total destruction to relative normalcy. Last used heavily during the fall of the Western Empire in approximately 700 BC, it had seen significant use in major conflicts before that.

A defensive version was used by the [[Goroesi]] to escape [[Moon's Fall]], as well as by the [[Towers of Sun, Earth, Moon, and Stars]] to evade the [[Cataclysm]]. A much smaller version was used by Queen [[Raanee]] sus'Crisial's parents, sacrificing themselves to [[Broken Order]] to preserve their daughter against [[Moon's Fall]].

Started in mid-summer 210 AC at the instigation of a pair of Sanctioned Adventurers, the Alliance has already succeeded in taking back one section of the ancient city.

From 211 onward, after the [[Liberation of Godsfall (Campaign)|liberation of Godsfall]] at the hands of the Alliance and the [[Godsfall Champions]], the Alliance became the ruling body of [[Godsfall]] until the formation of the [[Duarchy of Kotimaa]]. 

==Key Parties (211 through 230 AC==
===The Adventurer's Guild===
Main Article: [[Adventurer's Guild]]

The AG formerly acted as the gateway to the rest of the [[Federated Nations]] by controlling access through the portal network. With the successful retaking of the city and the end of active hostilities in the fall of 210 AC, the AG stepped down partially from that role as supplies can now come overland. It still maintains a presence there due to undiscovered threats and as the ''de facto'' owner of the portal node, but it only maintains an observer on the Alliance Conclave. The local representative was Crunch, a hobgoblin from the Windwalker goblin tribe. Committed to the AG, it is studiously neutral in all Alliance affairs. Their branch office is in [[Brightwater]], near the portal.

===The Sin Eaters===
Main Article: [[Sin Eaters]]

This schismatic religious group was headquartered nearby in the coastal town/fortress of [[True Hold|Heart-fire's Reach]], but now has a substantial contingent in and around Godsfall. Founded by a former adventurer, their ranks are heavy with Avowed and Dedicated members who wield divine power. Their beliefs preach against wickedness and command the destruction of evil. The branch of the group that is part of the Alliance is the more moderate ones, focused on destroying remaining demons, undead, or hostile orc clans, while the Reach-based branch preaches that all non-human (or elf or halfling) races are intrinsically evil and must be brought into subjugation or "cleansed". Currently, the Alliance branch is ascendant as it receives recruits and resources through the Alliance. Their headquarters is in [[Elysium]], in the former [[Imperial Cult]] temple that once housed the [[Forsakers]].

The Sin Eaters are responsible for patrolling the surrounding woods, as well as providing heavy combat support as needed when new pockets are uncovered. Caution, tact, and subtlety are not their strong suits. Their representative was Brother Fidelis, a fanatic-turned-moderate who assisted in the cleansing of the [[Brightwater]] quarter before the Alliance was formally founded. He is constantly having to suppress requests from his fire-breathing underlings to "cleanse" other parts of the city. They had a strained relationship with the [[Watching Eye]], and an outright distrust for the [[Free Peoples]]. They accepted the [[Sages]], and considered the [[Kaelthian Merchant Collective]] to be blind, money-grubbing fools (but are dependent on them for weaponry and supplies).

===The Honorable Society for the Preservation and Recovery of Historical Knowledge (the Sages)===
Main Article: [[Sages]]

The [[Sages]] have their headquarters in the [[Towers of Sun, Earth, Moon, and Stars]], but have established their second branch in [[Godsfall]]. Neutral politically, they prefer to be left alone to dig up and study artifacts and locations. They rely heavily on the [[Sin Eaters]] and the [[Free Peoples]] for protection and assistance, as many of the sages are old, infirm, or not trained for dangerous duties. Their representative was Assistant to the Vice-Rector for Western Pre-Cataclysm Religious Studies, Doctor Fredrich. This elderly human male possessed an encyclopedic knowledge of Western Imperial religious practices, but didn't have much of a head for politics. He prefered to skip Conclave meetings, only attending when his presence was directly required. He passed away in 235 AC of old age. Their headquarters is in [[Brightwater]], near the mage tower in the south-eastern part of that quarter.

===The Watching Eye===
Main Article [[Watching Eye]]

This orcish tribe has been present in [[Godsfall]] longer than any but the [[Free Peoples]]. A tribe specializing in shamanistic and arcane magic, they considered themselves the guardians of the wards around [[Godsfall]] for nearly 100 years until the recent events leading to the liberation of the city. Never numerous, they still remain one of the more potent magical forces in the region. Intensely conservative and traditional, they make their home in the [[Green Zone]]. They and the [[Sin Eaters]] strongly dislike each other. Shaman Kari, an elderly orcish nature-magic user, was their representative until 220 when she passed and was replaced by her protege, Shaman I'kara. If it were up to them, they would cut ties with the broader world. They accept the presence of the [[Free Peoples]]--the [[Kindred]] have become their friends and the Dominion are their (long-lost) cousins. They try to restrain the [[Sages]] from digging up things willy-nilly, and work to slow the influx of peoples and "civilization".

===The Kaelthian Merchant Collective (KMC)===
Main Article: [[Kaelthian Merchant Collective]]

With the end of formal conflict in the city, the Council government withdrew their active presence in late fall 210. They were replaced by a group of Kaelthia-based merchant organizations. Through their auspices, much-needed food, supplies, and people arrive overland or through the portal network. This has made some of them very wealthy, as the city has many pre-Cataclysm treasures to sell. It has not, however, made them popular. They are the most distrusted, most disliked group in the city (even more than the remnants of the arachnidae, which is saying something). They're considered greedy, oppressive, and venal. Their representative on the Conclave was Master Trader Whitehill, the owner-manager of the [[Whitehill Trading Company]], which specializes in metals and fine-work. A thin man with a broken nose, he and his agents are everywhere. They are currently pushing the Conclave to regulate merchant activity, a request that most believe is designed to secure a permanent monopoly for the KMC.

===The Free Peoples===
Main Article: [[Free Peoples]]

This is really four groups that have banded together. These are the true natives to the city, inhabiting [[Abaddon]] and the [[Arcadian Fields]]. Very disparate in origin, mindset, and desires, their mutual agreement is based on necessity rather than shared values and is quite fragile. They were represented by Huntress Cloud on Mountain of the [[Kindred]].

====The Kindred====
Numbering only a few hundred in 211, the [[Kindred]] are the last remaining tribe of a group of Waer-kin and [[Sher-ka]] who lived in [[Abaddon]] until destroyed by the [[Xe'laka]]. They are not fond of outsiders, but accept the [[Watching Eye]]'s protection and friendship. They especially dislike the [[Sin Eaters]]. Since then, they have grown significantly in number and repopulated that quarter.

====The Dominion====
These altered [[orcs]] (and related breeds including hell-bred orcs) once were slaves to the Demon Prince (wanna-be) [[Kul'Asad]]. Since his demise, they've declared themselves free of gods and masters and decided to forge their own destiny. Of all the groups, they've taken to industrialization and industrial food production (in the former quarter of [[Acheron]]) the most heavily. They want little or nothing to do with the past, but claim all the relics as their own heritage (mainly to reverse-engineer and rebuild). They welcome outsiders, but their customs (including debt slavery) and strict laws make it difficult for others to assimilate.

====The Arachidae====
This group of spider-like beings once was part of the vicious horde of [[Xe'laka]]. After the destruction of [[Shelob]], they threw themselves on the mercy of the Alliance rather than flee or be destroyed. Currently they are sentenced to farm the lands of [[Acheron]] under the watchful eye of the Dominion. Strongly disliked and distrusted, they keep to themselves and don't make waves.

====Isshin====
[[Isshin]] was a single mind housed in many bodies, all of which live in extensive tunnel networks under [[Abaddon]]. Content to be left alone, Isshin reached an agreement with the Alliance--it won't interfere with anything on the surface as long as its underground operations are left undisturbed. It occasionally trades excavated items or minerals for food or other goods, but is mostly self-sufficient. With the death of the host mind in 226 AC, a miracle of the [[Redeeming Blades]] gave the power of thought to the creatures that formed its body, forming a hive mind of individuals. They continue to act as a hive mind, but interact more with the surface.

They welcome outsiders, but their customs (including debt slavery) and strict laws make it difficult for others to assimilate.

===The Arachidae===
This group of spider-like beings once was part of the vicious horde of Xe'laka. After the destruction of Shelob, they threw themselves on the mercy of the Alliance rather than flee or be destroyed. Currently they are sentenced to farm the lands of Acheron under the watchful eye of the Dominion. Strongly disliked and distrusted, they keep to themselves and don't make waves.

===Isshin===
Isshin was a single mind housed in many bodies, all of which live in extensive tunnel networks under Abaddon. Content to be left alone, Isshin reached an agreement with the Alliance--it won't interfere with anything on the surface as long as its underground operations are left undisturbed. It occasionally trades excavated items or minerals for food or other goods, but is mostly self-sufficient. With the death of the host mind in 226 AC, a miracle of the Redeeming Blades gave the power of thought to the creatures that formed its body, forming a hive mind of individuals. They continue to act as a hive mind, but interact more with the surface.

This article describes the social and legal hierarchy of citizens of the Stone Throne. Status is relatively strictly observed (although much more so in [[Asai'ka]] than in the other two nations). Names in parentheses are the common forms of the actual name. The distinction between high and low justice is described in [[Justice Systems]].

===The Sa (Royalty)===
Queen’s Fang/Queen’s Tongue
The Queen's Fang is an absolute monarch (in principle). His wife, the Queen's Tongue, is the High Priestess and highest ecclesiastical authority. In principle, they are the check on the rest of the nobility. He serves as head of the military--the military is directly accountable to him, not to the local lords, although many officers are also noble. Phraya were confirmed by him at his sole discretion until the breakup of the [[Stone Throne]]. He still serves as a figurehead to which the phraya pay lip service but has no real power.

===The Isal (Nobility)===
These are the aristocracy of the Stone Throne. All are technically appointed by the superior nobles by nomination of their peers, but in practice nominations are rarely rejected and are hereditary. There are notable exceptions, however and clever, skilled, or wealthy people can climb the hierarchy relatively fast. Clergy are all of this caste by default. All of these prepend the title "Isal" to their names, as do their direct families (except muen, whose families are still of whatever status they were before elevation).

====Phraya (High Lords)====
The phraya are the regional administrators for each of the three major regions. They have essentially unreviewable high and low justice authority. Phra can appeal to the Fang or ask for Tongue’s Mercy, but that’s rarely granted. The phraya are directly and solely accountable to the Queen’s Fang who only intervenes in extreme cases. They appoint phra and lower nobles at their whim (although they usually ask for and follow nominations). They are supported through taxes/duties on lower nobles. Since the breakup of the [[Stone Throne]], they have become kings in their own right.

====Phra (Local lords, 2-6 per High Lord)====
The phra are the local lords, usually ruling over a city and its environs. They exercise high and low justice, although isal have right of appeal to the local phraya. They must approve nominations for appointment for khun status. They nominate people for appointment to the phra and luang, subject to approval by the phraya. They are tax-supported, mainly by the lesser nobles and the lai caste.

====Luang (Landed gentry)====
These nobles control large estates with many workers, mostly in rural areas. Often absentee landlords. They have the right of high and low justice on their estates, but lai and above have right of appeal to the phra. They nominate khun and approve and appoint muen. Higher ecclesiastical authorities are raised to this status and given estates for their support.

====Khun ("Householding" gentry, petty nobles)====
These are lesser nobles and priests who earned their status through service to the state (as a decorated officer of common birth), special services, or who purchased their titles. They only exercise low justice, and only in the absence of higher authority. Only ba can't appeal their decisions. The major distinction between khun and muen is that khun is a hereditary title (subect to approval by the superiors). Khun tend to cluster in urban areas. They are small landowners (often of specialty-goods plantations or mines), business owners, or mid-ranked priests. Luang often look down on them as being "jumped-up tradesmen," an epithet that the khun resent strongly.

====Muen (Courtesy nobles)====
This status is given to those commoners and tradesmen who must deal with nobles on a more equal footing or who have earned special rights. They can't exercise justice, but are allowed appeal to the phraya. These are uniformly life titles. Military officers and low-ranked priests who come from common or lai backgrounds are made muen so that they can do their jobs even when commanding nobles.

===Lai (Skilled Tradesmen)===
These are journeyman/master level crafters, merchants, and successful businessmen. They pay a seasonal tax on their profits in exchange for rights--they have the right to appeal judgements to the local phra and are immune to impression for labor pools. They all take the title Lai &lt;profession&gt; before their given and family names.

Among the lai, those involved in production of finished goods have higher status than those involved in resource extraction, with merchants falling to the lowest status.

===Commoners===
These make up 70% of the population--farmers and unskilled/semiskilled workers, as well as apprentices. They pay dues in-kind or in labor, mainly to luang. They are subject to impression for labor battalions and (rare) involuntary military service. Common soldiers can become muen, and a few have risen further.

===Ba (the Unclean Ones, obsolete)===
This caste was abolished in 211 AC. The Ba now can assume any rank (but most are commoners). They are still discriminated against in [[Asai'ka]].

==Clothing==
Clothing in the [[Jungle of Fangs]] varies much more by caste than by region. There are significant sumptuary laws that regulate what can (and cannot) be worn by people of each specific caste, rank, and profession.

Due to the climate of the region (hot and wet), the normal clothing is light and layered.

'''Materials''': Cotton is common, as is silk for the wealthy. Other plant fibers make up a large percentage of the textiles; wool is less common than in the northern nations and is reserved for cold weather and for the poor.

A fiber unique to the Stone Throne is [[steelsilk]]--a plant whose fibers, when treated alchemically, become almost metallic. Its production is labor-intensive, the plant is very picky about soil conditions, and the alchemical treatment is finicky and difficult to do right, making [[steelsilk]] extremely expensive to produce.While stronger than silk and just as light, it is capable of being woven into very sheer and durable fabric, it isn’t actually as strong as steel. It provides a modicum of cut-resistance, but it’s cost prohibits it from being used as armor for more than the very most wealthy. It shimmers with a metallic gloss--different strains and treatments produce different colors and patterns. The most prized is an opalescent, rainbow shimmer that comes from one small plantation in the [[Sha'slar Autonomous Zone]]. Enough of this for a woman’s over-robe have sold for the price of a small estate, complete with servants.

===Commoners===
Commoners make up the majority of the populace. Above the Ba, they can move freely and aren’t tied to the land or to an employer. However, their clothing is restricted.

'''Restrictions''': Commoners are not allowed to wear silk, [[steelsilk]], or fur. The only dye that they’re allowed is a form of yellow (it comes in various shades from a brown to a bright yellow). The only decorative materials they’re allowed are copper (or bronze), bone, shell, and wood. Trousers and coats are forbidden (by forbidding buttons and other closures). Hair below the shoulders is forbidden.

'''Clothing''': Most commoner clothing is made of wool, with cotton and linen reserved for festive or formal occasions. It’s frequently undyed; some is sun-bleached (because white is not a dye), although it never gets pure white.

Men and women both wear loincloths or sarongs (skirt-like waist wraps) throughout most of the year. A short shirt or tunic (reaching the waist) is worn if needed. Women may bind their breasts with a strip of cloth, although since the nudity taboo is minimal and most women are not heavily endowed, many do not do so on a regular basis. For formal occasions, each commoner will have a nicer tunic and sarong that they will wear.

Despite the restrictions, commoners (like most Stone Throne citizens) wear accessories. Wooden bangles, woven necklaces with shells or bone (or copper for the wealthy), flowers, etc. Wide-brimmed conical straw hats are worn to keep the sun off. Sandals (wood-soled or woven reeds) are the only common footwear.

Hair is worn roughly cut at the base of the skull/bottom of the ear, pulled back with a thong while working.

===Lai (Tradesmen)===
The tradesman/skilled professional class is the other pillar of the realm. Many of them (or their close ancestors) were commoners, and they are very protective of their status and are the quickest to keep the commoners (and other lai) in line. Although this isn’t a formal distinction, there is social pressure separating the lower classes of lai (those who are involved more directly in the extractive industries and do or direct heavy manual labor) from the upper classes (those who work with refined materials, are artists, or engage in intellectual labor, such as architects, alchemists, accountants and low-ranking priests, to name a few).

'''Restrictions''': The big change is that Lai can wear trousers. In fact, that is the mark of a lai--trouser-covered legs. Calling someone a “bare-leg” is a dismissive insult, because it compares them to commoners. [[Steelsilk]] is still forbidden, but the wealthy wear regular silk. They’re allowed blacks, green and red dyes, and take advantage of it. Very few wear the yellows common to the lower classes. Blues and purples are still forbidden. As for ornamentation, they can wear ornaments of silver, jet, and malachite. Hair is allowed to reach the bottom of the shoulder-blades, but no further.

====Lower class Lai====
Men wear loose trousers of cotton, linen, or wool with a leather belt. If the occupation demands, they wear a short sleeveless tunic or apron, held on by the belt. For formal occasions they wear a fancy, embroidered tunic, usually open at the neck with an embroidered hem.

Women wear loose trousers and a roum--a length of patterned cloth wound around the torso and over one shoulder, secured by a broach. For formal occasions, they wear a short tunic-like dress over their trousers; the dress is slit to show off the trousers.

Both men and women wear sandals; boots are only worn if their occupation demands it. Ornamentation is common, especially for fancy dress. This is usually woven out of strips of silver alloy and set with small malachite or jet shards.

Hair is worn tied back or braided, usually longer than a commoner but not reaching the shoulders.

====Upper-class Lai====
The big difference between upper and lower class lai is that upper class lai cover their torsos and their shirts have sleeves. Men wear trousers and shirts with the left sleeve loose and long. The right sleeve is short (cap or half-length), since many of these professionals handle pens for a living and long sleeves trail in the ink. The shirts button up the front (at least partially). Men often wear a sash across the chest with iconography indicating their profession and rank.

Female dress is more complicated--it is similar to the Vietnamese ''ao dai''--a short-or-long-sleeve dress worn over billowing trousers. The bodice is fitted, but the skirt is usually only a token--either it is slit to the waist or it is only a single strip of (patterned) cloth. The garment is worn over a thin undershirt or chemise. The collar is high, but the thin fabric and tight fit leaves little to the imagination.

Hair is worn up in a knot or bun, but a single long braid is left that reaches the shoulders. Accessories are similar to the lower class, although there are more of them (multiple bracelets are more common than rings or necklaces).

===Isal (Nobles)===
The Isal caste is the one that makes the rules, but even they have to obey certain dress standards. Wouldn’t want a muen (the lowest rank) to pass himself off as a khun or luang, now would we? Wool is avoided if possible, and only used for heavy-weather clothing.

'''Restrictions''': No legal limits. Any material they can afford, in any color, with any decoration. Cuts that ape the military or priestly dresses are discouraged, if not outright forbidden.

'''Muen &amp; Khun''': These lower ranks dress similar to upper-class lai, with a few important differences. For one, they always wear something blue. A trim, a gem, a scarf--something visible and blue, because blue is forbidden to the lai. The material tends to be finer than lai clothing, but not by much. Many of this rank aren’t much richer than the wealthier lai, so it ends up very similar.

'''Luang (large landowners)''': Both genders wear variations on the ''ao dai'', called ''sur ao dai''. Male ''sur ao dai'' are slightly thicker and usually button up the front, with long flowing sleeves. Their skirts are perfunctory and usually take the form of a set of tails (like on a fancy tuxedo). They are always white with blue trim, but the trousers they’re worn over vary tremendously in cut and color. Womens’ versions are usually almost diaphanous and worn directly on the skin. They tend to be cut aggressively low in front and back, and feature long flowing trains and sleeves that reach the floor. The colors vary widely and usually include intricate patterns. These are worn with high-platform shoes that restrict movement.

Since these are highly impractical garments, the day-to-day informal wear is much similar to those of lower nobles, just with fancier fabrics and decorations.

Hair is long (often reaching the waist or below), and usually worn down or pulled back in front. Accessories are subtle, but blue stones and forms of jade are prized.

'''Phra and Phraya''': The highest ranks wear whatever they feel like. This often takes the form of variations on military uniforms, but Phraya [[Ssa'ka]] was known to hold audiences in an open-front robe and loincloth. No one dared say anything. Or, for that matter, copy his style. The way to tell a phra is by their attitude and the deference paid by everyone around them, not by their clothing.

===Military===
Serving in the military is a privilege--there is no conscription. Part of the deal is that you get status while you’re serving, status equivalent to the lowest lai if you were a commoner, and a chance to rise through dedicated service. Both men and women serve in the military.

Military uniforms (worn under armor or when not in active combat) are boxy-cut tunics and straight-leg trousers, worn with a leather harness that serves as belt and attaches to the shoulders as well. This is true for all ranks. Higher ranks have better tailors (instead of mass-produced garb) and better fabrics, but the essential cut remains the same. The tunics fall to the middle-upper part of the thigh.

Rough ranks are denoted by the color of the tunic; more specific ranks are told by the collar and decorations on the collar. Common soldiers wear undyed wool (in grey or brown depending on the exact source), while veterans (sargeants, etc.) wear orange. Courtesy officers (lai or commoners who were raised to the rank of muen for the duration of their service) wear red, and blue and purple are reserved for officers of noble rank.

Individual decorations are prohibited officially, but it’s common to see small embroideries on common uniforms or fancy materials or slightly better cuts, etc. on noble officers.

These uniforms are worn with leather boots. Military personnel wear their uniforms even when off-duty, unless they’re nobles acting in their noble role, in which case they wear their appropriate caste clothing.

===Priest-Bureaucrats===
The priest-bureaucrats are both spiritual leaders and administrators for the nation. While their rank hierarchy (which at the top is comparable in general to a khun or luang) is byzantine and convoluted, some general trends in clothing are visible.

'''Ceremonial Garb''': When officiating in religious ceremonies, priests are of two types. Altarites serve at the altars and wear nothing but a heavy leather apron, dyed blood red. This is a simple length of leather with a hole cut for the head and a strap on each side at the waist. Pockets are attached to the front panel on each side for ceremonial equipment. Dancers perform the sacred dances. They wear very thin gowns of silk with nothing else. These gowns are usually slit to maximize the flexibility and freedom of movement of the dancers, who contort themselves and exhibit almost unnatural flexibility, like the snakes they revere.

'''Ranking Priests''': When not officiating, ranking priests (who are usually altarites and serve in the Holy City of [[Ar Salem Dolem]]) wear something very similar to the male gwerin formal robes--a sashed, multi-layer robe worn over trousers. The color and style of the robe, to a knowledgeable observer, pinpoints the rank, political leanings, and exact role of the individual in question.

'''Ministering Priests''': Those priests who serve in the communities (as opposed to in the Holy City) wear a particular outfit known as the ''phneka'' (from a word meaning “partial”) when not officiating. This consists of  a pair of trousers with one leg cut very short and half an ''ao dai'' covering the trousered-leg. A half-shirt (worn so the side that’s open is covered by the ''ao dai'') completes the look, along with a cord belt. This symbolizes that they’re both of the lai and of the commoners. It is always dyed in a rainbow of colors, but not in any uniform pattern. Honestly, they look kind of ridiculous.

      <text bytes="2031" sha1="jufupb9dozfkk4qn4gur2utki954qvh" xml:space="preserve">Kul'Asad was born Primai Asad in [[Imperial Meztli]] about 60 BC. Trained as a mage, he rose to power as the Court Mage to Emperor [[Mez'tla IV]] in 20 BC. When the [[Cataclysm War]] began, he turned his coat and went over to the forces of chaos, quickly rising to power as one of the commanding generals due to his mastery of Concept Summoning. His area of responsibility was the Northern Legion that swept from the [[Iron Dominions]] towards [[Godsfall]] and was supposed to rendezvous at the Pactum battlefield for the final battle.

He, along with most of his army and his enslaved concept [[Archon of Time|Broken Causality]], were trapped in [[Godsfall]] by the desperate ritual. The backlash from this acted as a quasi-[[concept bomb]], taking him and his army out of time for a hundred years and slowing time. Thus, when the [[Godsfall Champions]] arrived, only 80 years had passed for the residents, and even less for Kul'Asad.

==Temporal Plots==
Kul'Asad believed that via the power of the concept he (partially) controlled, he could re-write history by interfering at specific points. This control of history would allow him to become the emperor of some new empire. He used these temporal shenanigans to make contact with the [[Imperial Sons]] and align them to his service.

When he became aware of the Champions' attempt to interfere, he went back in time and influenced the destruction of [[Usko Ffyd]] via the Sons in an attempt to kill [[Quickleaf]] and [[Saeth Saren]]. Of course this backfired and led to them becoming adventurers and thus to interfering, showing that time-meddling never has good results.

==Downfall==
Main Article: [[Godsfall Liberation (Campaign)]]

The [[Godsfall Champions]], investigating the city, made contact with [[Archon of Time|Broken Causality]], who warned them that Kul'Asad was causing issues. They investigated and ended up defeating him, shooting him down as he tried to flee his tower after they humiliated him.

Led by an obsessive [[gwerin]] noble named [[Selan sur Seren]], they only concern themselves with ancient relics of magic. It is believed that they have ties to the (proscribed in most nations) [[Imperial Sons]] organization; they certainly have little concern for social norms or niceties if they get in the way of uncovering lost secrets of magic. Joining the Seekers is by invitation only.

Strongly opposed to the [[Crystal Spire Protocols]], they were formally dubbed a terrorist organisation by the [[Adventurer's Guild]] in 245 AC and membership is banned in all FN members except [[Shinevog]], although this banning is obeyed only in the breach in the [[Duarchy]].

They were responsible for the destruction of [[Usko Ffyd]] in 206 AC as part of a campaign waged by [[Kul'Asad]] to retroactively destroy the [[Godsfall Champions]], two of which hailed from that town.

      <text bytes="9660" sha1="b746gugwyyqki34bgbqw59s59aa4mkp" xml:space="preserve">While the [[puun ihmisia]] and the [[gwerin]] have been at odds for ages and traditionally distrust and hate each other, some have made efforts to reach out to the other side. About 100 years after the chaos of the [[Cataclysm]] and the Retreat, two groups did just this and founded the commune of Usko Ffydd (named by joining the words for “faith” or “trust” in the two languages). 4 years ago, this experiment came to a tragic end—not by act of betrayal but by outside meddling.

==Location and Way of Life==
The founders of Usko Ffydd, wanting to put distance between them and the dominant culture of the nascent [[Council Lands]], chose to take their families and move nearly 100 miles into the uninhabited, rough lands between the [[Ringwall Mountains]] of [[Moon's Vengeance]]. In this folded land, carpeted with forested mountains and hills, they founded a central village and took up residence. Their nearest neighbors were the dwarves of the [[Chuuluu]] clan, with their clan hold in the mountains to the north east (about 60 miles), although not much commerce was to be had with these arch-traditionalists. 

This area had not been inhabited by more than wandering tribes since the 1st Interregnum started more than 4,000 years before; it was totally wild. Deciding to live in harmony with the world and the spirits, the founders established a mixed pattern of life—three seasons spent wandering in small family-like bands, living in huts and gathering food, with the winters spent in the village itself. Late fall was a time of gathering, both of people and of supplies for the winters which were frequently full of heavy snowfall. Each year, one band would stay back in the village to maintain and repair it after the ravages of the winter.

These bands were not exactly families—the people did not think of themselves that way. All the children were raised in common by the band, and older children would find a band with which they were comfortable. Interbreeding between the gwerin and ihmisia occurred—in what follows, the labels “gwerin” and “ihmisia” refer to the more dominant features of an individual, as well as their magical tendencies. Most of the second and subsequent generations were of mixed blood.

All the founding families were talented in the arts magical—the two gwerin families were headed by accomplished wizards, while the 6 ihmisia families included rangers and druidic and shamanistic practitioners of note. They agreed to learn from one another, blending the arcane and the primal. The only rule was that all power must be used for the good of the people and of the land.

==Philosophy==
The Fyddans, as they called themselves, prided themselves on living in harmony. Both with each other and with the world around them. “Do not be a rock in the stream,” they taught. Instead, “bend like the willow while keeping your roots firmly planted.” “Do good to all around you—give up your own ego for the good of community and the world.” “Be the change you want to see in the world.” These were among their teachings.

This extended to their magical efforts. For the druidic practitioners, this meant carefully weighing the effect of each spell and trying to touch as lightly as possible, while trying to guide the world into a more peaceful coexistence. For the arcanists, this involved mostly ritual work and trying to measure how their spells affected the kami around them. In essence, they tried to merge the two disciplines of magic, a feat long thought impossible.

==Last Days of Usko Ffyd==
In the late summer of 206 AC, as the Ffydans started to gather in supplies for the oncoming winter, the outriders and scouts started reporting a strange pattern of behavior among the local wildlife. It started with the rabbits and other small rodents—listlessness punctuated by extreme and uncharacteristic violence. Animals that were confined would writhe and scratch at themselves, often biting themselves to death. Being kindly people, the Ffydans organized teams to try to aid the poor creatures. Their efforts were unsuccessful, and as the weeks progressed into fall, the situation became more dire.

By the beginning of High Harvest of that year, the trees and plant-life in the vicinity of the village were starting to mutate and even the large animals were showing growths and tumors. No resident had taken sick, but tensions were growing. Hunting (to cull the weak and sick) provided a lot of the wintertime food supply, and no one could trust the land. The kami were no longer responding to the druids, merely screaming or lying unresponsive. Scouts sent out found that the effect stopped about 30 miles (a day and a half journey) from the village. This news led to arguments. Some counseled to flee outside the toxic effect and create as best of shelter as they could. Others, worried about the signs of a harsh, early winter that year, wanted to stay and try to find a cure. “This was surely magical”, they cried. “We can cure this.” This dispute cost them precious time. By the time the majority decided to flee, it was already getting quite cold.

They decided to flee toward the Chuuluu clan-hold. Each family moved together; hopes mounted as they made the slow journey toward the edge of the affected region. “Surely today will be the day,” they told themselves. But by the middle of the third day, about 40 miles away from the village, the truth became apparent. The toxin was following them, like a cloud. Mocking voices were heard, telling them that it was all their neighbor’s fault. This news broke the village’s bonds, made fragile under the stress. Each family fled in separate directions, hoping that it was following someone else. As it turns out, it was following the gwerin, specifically. The gwerin, realizing this, turned around and headed back home, hoping to find a cure before they succumbed and hoping to draw it away from their brethren and friends. The ihmisia escaped the cloud; a few stayed at the edge, hoping to lend aid. They soon found themselves struggling to survive the unusually harsh winter—after but a week or two they lost contact with the gwerin remnant.

Meanwhile, the gwerin families worked feverishly to find a cure as the terrain around them went mad. Fungal-like growths grew from the ground, the buildings, and from everything around them. Soon the people took sick—going slowly mad as they found themselves changing. It seemed that the malady was adapting to their attempts to cure it. Each treatment would work, for a time, and then make things worse. Lack of food and the cold winter only hastened the decline. As each died, the survivors would burn the body to attempt to contain the plague. By the time the weather started to clear, a few months later, only two survived. Rinne, a newly-adult gwerin woman, and her mother, Aada. Knowing that further efforts were futile, they burned the last of the bodies and shouldering their last few supplies, headed north-west toward civilization. Behind them they left the twisted, corrupted remains of their home. The corruption seemed even more concentrated, as if [[Melara]]’s icy mercy had killed off all the surrounding malady, leaving only the village itself as a source of vile taint. After several days of miserable travel in the late-winter ice, they approached the village of [[Fulford]], at the edge of the [[Sea of Grass]]. Aada, knowing that she herself was succumbing to the plague, refused to risk the village’s safety. She remained outside until she died a day later and was buried in a shallow grave carved by the daughter’s newly-mastered magic. Hardened by the loss of her parents, her village, and her innocence, Rinne renounced that name and took the name of [[Godsfall Champions|Saeth Saran]]. Why was Rinne spared the plague, when all else succumbed? Who brought it upon them? No one knows for sure, although some suspect the involvement of the [[Imperial Sons]], a shadowy magical research group. 

A few days after they left, Deilen Werdd and three other young ihmisia, only survivors of their band, approached the edge of the twisted village. They found the cold remains of a funeral pyre, a village consumed by twisted monstrosities, and two sets of tracks leading north-west. Deilen chose to follow the tracks, sending the others off to find a place to live. A few days of hard travel later, he came upon a grave at the edge of the forest overlooking civilization. On the crude head-stone was engraved the word “Mother”. Praying to the kami, he begged their protection for the site. Moved by his earnest feelings, the kami of the meadow responded, wrapping their protection around the crude grave-site. He returned periodically throughout the following years, tending to the grave and leaving offerings for the dead. Turning to the thieves’ life, he joined the [[Mockers]], leaving his parents’ ideals in the past…or did he? One thing he did leave in the past was his name, taking the name [[Godsfall Champions|Quickleaf]] in its place.

Years later, both Quickleaf and Saeth, as they were now known, joined the newly-formed [[Adventurer's Guild]]. Both graduated at the same time, but joined different adventuring groups. The rigors of their path after the death of Usko Ffydd and the new names made them strangers to each other--it wasn't until much later, once fate had brought them together again in an adventuring party in the ruins and intrigue of Godsfall, that they recognized each other and discovered the truth about the fate of their parents and friends.

Legend: 
* Grey areas are unrestricted and thus suitable for commoners. Commoners are not allowed to live within the walls of the city unless registered as a servant of a noble. This area also contains many of the sweatshops and manufactories involving significant brute labor.
* Gold areas are inhabited by lai-caste citizens--craftsmen, tradesmen, and other skilled workers. The Trade District separates the noble and priestly districts from the common areas.
* Red areas are dedicated to the priest-bureaucracy. Much of this is taken up by the city homes of ranking bureaucrats from the Holy City, [[Ar Salem Dolem]]. The rest is warehouses and training facilities.
* Blue areas are dedicated to noble estates. These range from apartments for the low-ranking (or poor) nobles to palatial estates occupying whole blocks. For many, this is their city home.

==Founding==
The current city of Asai'ka was founded in 98 AC, on the ruins of a pre-Cataclysm city of the same name. The first ruler, [[Ssa'ka]] was the leader at the time of the [[Cataclysm]]; he also led the rediscovery of the Holy City.

Due to a combination of circumstances (the invasion of [[Noefra]] by the [[Nameless]] and his army of monsters as well as the improper activation of the [[Eyes of Qa'desh|Left Eye]]), a [[planar realignment]] occurred, threatening to destroy the entire Dream. This ended when the [[Great Mechanism]] took back the power of the [[Old Gods]] (depowering and effectively killing them) and used that mass of anima to stabilize the planes.

As a result of this planar realignment and the massive consumption of anima, all magic ceased function for nearly 50 years (in [[Noefra]], less in other places) and the land was jumbled. Whole nations (including the [[Flower Kingdom]] were swallowed by the waves; many refugees had to flee. Overall, it is estimated that nearly 70% of the population of [[Noefra]] died during those 50 years (10-40% of the population on other continents) due to starvation, war, and natural disasters of all types.

The western [[Noefra]]n civilizations have taken this event as the 0-point of their new [[calendar]]. Years after the Cataclysm are marked as After Cataclysm, while those before are Before Cataclysm.

      <text bytes="4339" sha1="0sjt9qva64cwq4pmigfv6dvap5ec1hp" xml:space="preserve">Ar Salem Dolem is the religious heart of the nations of the [[Jungle of Fangs]]. Hidden in a pocket valley at the eastern edge of the [[Jungle of Fangs]], it is surprisingly small for its cultural and political importance. Occupied mostly by priests and bureaucrats, Fang [[Salzaron]] also holds court from the [[Great Pyramid]] there.
[[File:Ar-Salem-Dolem.png|frameless|800px|Ar Salem Dolem]]
The two biggest buildings are the Great Pyramid itself (see below) and the [[Adventurer's Guild]] palace, formerly the home of the High Priestess. A portal node stands behind the Adventurer's Guild.

==Demographics (250 AC)==
TODO

==The Great Pyramid==
The Great Pyramid is the largest single structure in the Federated Nations, and the oldest as well. It is a pyramid of matte black stone (which is not native to the region) covering an area 1/4 mile on a side and standing 666 feet tall. Other than the entrances there are no visible openings--the whole building seems to drink the light. The inside is filled with twisting passages and rooms, some with ancient pipes and strange machinery visible in the walls. Rooms located at the exterior have one-way windows. At the center of the temple is the Stone Throne itself, a simple throne made of the same stone as the building itself, as if it grew up out of the floor. The Queen's Fang does not occupy this throne, as it is left open for the [[Queen Ascendant]]. That audience chamber used to also house a sacrificial altar where thousands of people were sacrificed to feed a demon's hunger. That practice was ended 5 years ago when the [[Catalysts]] intervened and enabled the Queen (at that point not ascended yet) to break free of the ancient bonds that held her as a living conduit for those souls.

According to tradition, the Great Pyramid dates back to the ancient aelvar empire of the 2nd age. Some scholars scoff at this, placing the construction much later during the early [[Fanged Kingdom]] about 1000 years ago. No one is sure how air and water (and waste) are handled, but they are. There are reports that some corridors reshape themselves over time.

The Great Pyramid is occupied by the senior priests and bureaucrats of the kingdom. Being assigned quarters here is both a mark of favor and a threat--it is rumored that the Salzaron can spy on any room of the temple almost at will. Many ranking priests and nobles also maintain estates in other parts of the city or in [[Asai'ka (City)|Asai'ka]] in the jungle below.

The temple is surrounded by a paved courtyard, containing residences for servants and low-ranking bureaucrats, stables, and storehouses. 

==Neighborhoods==
===Forecourt===
The Forecourt is a small region dominated by low-class pilgrim lodgings, taverns, diversions, and other businesses that are frowned upon in the rest of the city. This and the Foreign Quarter are the only places that commoners are allowed to stay overnight. The [[Forked Kiss]] is the premier public house in this quarter, boasting a full quartet of temple-trained dancers as entertainment. The streets are narrow and the buildings made of wood with thatched roofs; they stand two or three stories tall.

===Foreign Quarter===
The Foreign Quarter is the area of the city set aside for those of the lower classes or those from foreign lands that have secular business in the city. Scholars, foreign petitioners, messengers, merchants--all of these are confined to this quarter after sundown. The only exception are official members of the [[Adventurer's Guild]], who can stay at the Guild palace. Foreign visitors must wear a chonobartes, an armband of strips of yellow and blue cloth interwoven. Failure to wear this in plain sight is punished by exile and a lifetime ban on re-entry into the [[Stone Throne]]'s territory. The inn [[Santhakar]] is the high-class option for visitors, while the inn [[Chai-ko]] is a cheaper alternative. The quarter has many closely-spaced buildings with small alleyways between them. These buildings tend to have brick or stone facades and the higher-class buildings have slate roofs.

Leaking through, evading the [[angels]] who hunt them in the dark near the Crystal Sphere, they take the form of heptagonal purple-red crystals. When an unfortunate mortal being touches these crystals, the Awakener segment within jumps into their mind and hijacks their body. In almost every case, this results in the total madness of the victim and the degeneration of the land around it until the host is killed. In extreme cases, the segment gains enough strength to replicate itself and possess new bodies. If left unchecked, this would result in it summoning its full self from the [[Dark Beyond]], bypassing the defenses of the world. A purple-red tide of death and madness would sweep over [[Quartus]], absorbing and converting everything into more of it. The Dream would crumble and return to the void. To prevent this, the angelic host has a standing no-mercy policy. Any substantial infestation of Awakener on Quartus results in the total destruction of that area down to the lower bedrock. Collateral damage is not considered unless that would jeopardize the planet itself.

The [[gwerin]] masters, believing themselves the heirs to the ancient aelvar empire, broke off from the [[Western Empire]] during the reign of Emperor [[Primus Aurum]], second in the [[Aurum Dynasty]]. Scholars believe that they made some sort of deal to provide magical technology involving biological and/or soul manipulation to the Western Empire in exchange for independence, because that was their strong specialty.

The nobles of the Fanged Kingdom were notable for worshiping/revering a serpentine deity known as the [[Old Gods|Rainbow Serpent]]. In its image, they modified many of their servant peoples ([[humans]] and lesser [[gwerin]]) to have serpentine traits. From those experiments sprang the [[Ophidian]] race and the serpent-kin culture. They also implanted hereditary, genetic commands that still affect the [[Fang-kin Culture|culture]] in the Jungle of Fangs, such as the castes and the restriction of the color blue to the noble caste (who were the descendants of the overseer caste).

In approximately 300 BC, the last of the rulers made a pact with the [[White Skull]] in which they would provide a never-ending supply of worship to him in exchange for the knowledge and power to apotheosize and become deities in their own right. To fulfill their end of the bargain, they implanted a genetic command to worship the [[Queen Ascendant]], who was the daughter of the last king of the kingdom. Acting on the knowledge they received in exchange, the masters carried out a grand ritual on their mobile fortress palace, [[Ar Dolema]] and disappeared from history. Did they ascend? If so, there is no record of them. Did they botch the ritual and destroy themselves? That is the consensus of most scholars. Others believe that they entered a closed demiplane or that one of them betrayed the others and ascended alone, dooming the others to oblivion. Yet others believe that they ended up in the [[Abyss]] as punishment for their horrific crimes.

Born the daughter of the last king of the [[Fanged Kingdom]] in approximately 315 BC, her name has been erased from history. As part of her father's bid at apotheosis, she was (involuntarily) placed upon the Stone Throne in [[Ar Salem Dolem]] and a ritual focus was constructed. All the worship and the souls of the sacrifices (at first only animals, but later humans) flowed through here and into the focus (and thus to the [[White Skull]]). She acted as both an object of worship and a filter, purifying and focusing the stream of anima. Her lifespan, fed by the anima stream, was tremendously prolonged, but she had to endure the detritus left behind as the souls flowed through her own.

Unable to leave the [[Ar Salem Dolem|Great Pyramid]] and under the control of the High Priest (who was given a control totem), she was a ceremonial figurehead until the [[Cataclysm]]. There is little record of her having any influence. In the years after the [[Cataclysm]] and before the people returned from [[Kel'al'ar]], she and a much-reduced priestly bureaucracy coexisted uneasily. After the return and the founding of the [[Stone Throne]] nation, she began to exert influence through her [[Handmaiden (Title)|handmaidens]]--body doubles chosen and altered to look like her and act as her agents throughout the nation.

It was through a retired handmaiden that she made contact with the [[Catalysts]] who were exploring the [[Stone Throne]] from the [[Council Lands]], seeking the [[Dark Lady]]. They, in their inimitable fashion, came to [[Ar Salem Dolem]] and stormed the High Priestess's estate, killing her and destroying the both the control focus and then the ritual focus, breaking the spells that held her bound.

==Ascension and Worship==
Without the ritual that bound her, the mortal frame of the Queen began to fray. The [[First Law]], long in abeyance by demonic power, now started to bind. But buoyed up by the faith and worship of a nation, the Queen saw a chance to transcend death and continue watching over her people from the realms immortal. Her apotheosis occurred on the Feast of Serpents Waiting in the year 205 AC. Surrounded by her [[handmaiden]]s and most loyal worshipers, she cheated death's embrace and flew on the wings of worship through Shadow into the [[Astral]] plane without tasting death. There she surrendered her flesh, forming a new body of astral energies and staking a claim on a demesne in [[Mara]]. Her [[Divine Rank]] is [[Ascended heroes|Ascended Hero]].

===Worship===
Worship of the Queen Ascendant revolves around three major facets--
====The Priest-Bureaucracy====
The Queen Ascendant's faith is a very structured, ordered thing. Priests, chosen from all the castes (and walks of life in those nations who have rejected the caste system), minister to the spiritual needs of the people and are a vital part of the secular government. Joining the priesthood means leaving your former caste and rank and taking on a new one. Priest-bureaucrats have four major categories in a strict hierarchy:

# The High Temple and attendants. These live and work in the Sacred City of [[Ar Salem Dolem]] and especially in the High Temple there, where the Queen lived for centuries. They make the decisions for all three nations, although most directly for [[Asai'ka]]. Competition here is fierce but hidden. Generally only those of noble birth attain these posts, despite the technical lack of birth-based rank among the priesthood.
# The Auditors. These special agents are few in number, but feared. They keep the other priests in line, enforcing the High Temple's edicts. Rarely do they show their faces or proclaim their identities. They are drawn from all walks of life--only skill and devotion matter. Dwarves are especially common among this group, taking to the work with a zealotry that frightens many.
# The Settled. These have places of fixed abodes in the cities and larger towns. Drawn from lesser noble and lai ranks, they are the local authorities and often rule with as much force as a noble.
# The Wanderers. These travel circuits among the villages and smaller towns. Generally of the common folk, they command little veneration.

Priests can be known by their clothing, especially while engaged in ritual work. As much of the [[Stone Throne Religion|worship practice]] involves bloodshed (of animals mostly these days), they wear naught but an apron made of a single sheet of cloth with leather reinforcements and a hole cut for the head. This is placed over the officiant and tied with thongs on each side, leaving the sides bare. See also [[Fang-kin Culture]]. 

The priests also act as musicians during the sacred dances, mainly playing atonal music on flutes and keeping rhythm on drums.
====The Temple Dancers and the Sacred Dances====
Much of the most sacred service is done by the Temple Dancers. These are men and women, chosen for their flexibility, grace, and beauty very young and trained rigorously. During the high festivals and sacred rites (such as at the installation of a new landed noble), they dance the sacred dances to the accompaniment of priestly drummers and musicians. These dances are fluid, and range from frantic acrobatics to languid contortions, often switching back and forth multiple times in a single dance. Generally only a single dancer will dance at a time, although a few of the most holy ones call for two women. Generally, female dancers are of higher rank and are more sought after, as the most holy dances can only be performed by women.

Temple dancers wear shifts of diaphanous silk that leaves very little, if anything, to the imagination. Those that would treat them as prostitutes, however, find that they are also trained to defend themselves without weapons. As well as incurring the wrath of the entire bureaucracy.

Technically, dancers are outside the hierarchy and answer only to the high priestess and the [[handmaiden]]s. It is whispered that some of the most decadent, debased nobles have started training their own corps of dancers who do more than just dance.

In outlying settlements or among the [[ophidian]] tribes, the people themselves enact the sacred dances. This is frowned on by the bureaucracy, but tolerated. Authentic temple dancers rarely make it out there anyway, and there's no need to squelch their fervor.
====Willing Sacrifice====
After the homily and readings from the sacred works (produced by the bureaucracy and expounded as commandments from the Queen) but before any dances that take may place come the sacrifices. Since the Ascension, these are of two forms (full blood sacrifice of an intelligent being being absolutely forbidden and carefully monitored)--
* Animal sacrifice is the most common. A chicken, a pig, or on rare occasions something larger. The animals are drugged and exanguinated while alive, the blood being caught and given to the flames on the altar. Once dead, the organs (especially the heart) are removed and ritually burned. The meat is then prepared and shared among the participants.
* Token blood sacrifice. This is done only on occasions of ceremonies such as marriages, religiously-binding vows, funerals, or pledges of loyalty to a new sovereign. Those that are giving sacrifice come forth and are pricked with a sacred knife. The most common sites are the earlobes and the ball of the thumb, although some have been known to give sacrifice from their private parts in extreme cases of fanaticism. A single drop of blood is shed onto a piece of cloth; once each participant has comingled their blood with the others, the cloth is ritually blessed and consigned to the holy flames, carrying their devotion to the Queen.

      <text bytes="5500" sha1="sk5c3zuk2fqdxivsyna9pn3mi7psd7e" xml:space="preserve">==Government==
*Pre 251 AC:
**Theocratic republic, much like Iran
**Regional vote elects 24-member Senate which select Chancellor (Head of Government). High priests have significant pull and back-door veto power. Chancellor must have approval of Head Lecturer and Head of Oracles as well.
**Towns and cities elect Mayor + Council under oversight of local Ecclesiarch or seated priests.
**Villages and below work communally, almost pure democracy. Acolytes have significant persuasive power but little direct power (except as informants to higher-ups).
*Post 251 AC
**Strict theocratic dictatorship under the [[Prophet of Law Unveiled]].  
**Close-in villages are theoretically the same as before (communal consensus), but really the acolytes and agents of the [[Holy Hands]] are in control.  
**Villages and towns further out than about 60 miles have been abandoned to their fates.  

==Peoples==
* Wall-builder humans. Plurality (~45%).
* Wall-builder halflings. Significant minority (35%).
* Dwarves. 18%
* Others (a few high elves, mostly). 2%

==Religion==
Pre 251: See [[Church of the Seasons]]. Almost everyone belongs and at least pretends devotion. Strongly evangelistic.

Post 251: The Church has collapsed (locally) and been replaced by the [[Law of Truth (Religion)|Law of Truth]]

==Culture==
* Strongly communal and devout. Sticking out is discouraged. Live by the consensus of your neighbors.
* Non-monogamous. Communities raise children together and share partners. Even the dwarves (who still have life partners) aren't nearly as rigid about it (no divorce, but no adultery stigma either).
* Everyone works. Begging and thievery are BAD THINGS that get you sent to re-education camps. Which are mostly labor/training + preaching. Repeated refusal to work honestly results in exile.
* No privacy. Everyone talks to the priests about everything and records are kept.
* Criminal behavior is punished harshly; anti-social behavior (defying consensus) is considered the worst.  
* Temple or shrine is the center-point of village/town life.
Post 251:

* Split into "washed" and "unwashed" and "out-law".
** "Washed" are the righteous believers in the Law of Truth and its Prophet. They have rights and status and can enter [[Kaelthia]] and conduct business (as much as it is) freely.
** "Unwashed" were citizens of the HKR, but either weren't zealous in the change-over or held "unproductive" roles in society. They have some rights (the right not to be assaulted or enslaved or killed outright) but are decidedly second-class. They can live ''near'' the holy city, but can only enter it under the guidance of one of the Washed. They can buy and sell normally, but cannot carry weapons other than knives and are subject to harsh penalties if they injure or inconvenience the Washed.
** Out-Law are the rest of everyone. They are "without the law". For purely political reasons, they have passage rights and sanctuary from assault, but cannot enter the holy city and cannot conduct any business (including procuring shelter) except at designated inns and markets, where they must sell to and buy from the Washed.
* Very inward looking.
* Drunkenness, idleness, sexuality (of any kind except to engender children), fancy dress, and "mercantilism" (meaning profit motive) are banned.
* Trade chits for labor value are used instead of currency internally, with Out-Laws required to convert coinage when doing business at a fixed, government-set exchange rate. That sucks.
* Black market activity is punishable by exile or death.
* Those Unwashed who don't want to follow the strictures are cast out; most head north with whatever they can carry. 

==Capital==
See [[Kaelthia]].

==Economy==
;Exports: fibers, grain, beef and pork. Arcane items are a specialty. Major trade routes to [[Shinevog]] and [[Zhapai Karmap]] run through the HKR. [[Spidersilk]] is only produced in the HKR.:After 251 AC, very little, and no arcane items. No trade routes run through the area.
;Imports: Lumber products. Dyes, fur and leather, and spices. Unworked metal and specialty metal products. Non-magical technology.:After 251AC, very little and only lumber to any degree.

==International relationships==
* Generally poor. As a hyper-religious, conformist nation with a history of being pushy, most other nations are wary of it.
* Especially poor with the [[Crisial Kingdom]] and the [[Duarchy]]. Too much history and bad blood between them.
* Considered "suspect" by the [[Adventurer's Guild]].
**Post 251 AC -- while they haven't withdrawn from the [[Federated Nations]] treaty, they have declared non-compliance with the [[Crystal Spire Protocols]] (specifically rejecting the right of the [[Adventurer’s Guild]] to police internal affairs and rejecting the rights of registered adventurers within their territory).
**They have embargoed land passage in and out of [[Guildtown]], the AG enclave outside of [[Kaelthia]], claiming it was a "security risk" due to the tunnel under the mountain.
**So far the AG has not taken direct action due to internal political turmoil as a result of corruption uncovered by [[Enigma]].
* No active war, just enhanced border checks (on both sides).

==Leadership==
The supreme leader of the HKR post 251AC is the [[Prophet of Law Unveiled]]. His pronouncements are taken as the absolute, immutable truth.

Other significant organizational leaders are the High Hands of the [[Holy Hands]]. Their true identities are unknown.

* "Seated" priests local to towns. Larger towns may have more. Not specific to any particular god, although generally lean toward one of the Four. Generally cap at 3rd level spells at most. Have acolytes directly under them
* "Wandering" priests who preside over smaller villages in an area. Low power (1st level, maybe 2nd level spells), functionally divine soul sorcerer / celestial warlock
* Acolytes resident in villages. Often non-magical or only minimal (Magic Initiate: Cleric or Ritual Caster: Cleric). Report to wandering priests.

==Doctrines and Worship==
* The purpose of life is to build up each other and build up civilization against the wild and destructive forces.
* A place for everyone and everyone in their place--envy not others.
* Value/joy of work, especially growing/making things.
* Bring joy into each other's life by sharing with them. Jealousy and self-seeking are sins.
* Give praise to the Gods for your good fortune.
* Worship: Communal praise + prayer on 4th-day, followed by public confession of sin. Minor sins paid for by sacrifices of property.

===Devotional Liturgy===
The Church, while it accepts all the [[Congregation]] as gods, focuses on the four seasons. Smaller shrines may have a niche dedicated to all the other gods in one, while chapels and temples generally have separate shrines throughout the churchyard for each of the others.

As for the main four, the acolytes worship in song on 4th-day, following the pattern below:
* Morning song to [[Sakara]]: Dawn of Love Triumphant, celebrating love's victory over hate as shown by the victory of dawn over night.
* Dawn service, service of new beginnings. Babies are blessed as are newly-trained artisans. Betrothals are announced (often with bride already showing signs of pregnancy).
* Noon song to [[Tor-Elan]]: As the Sun in Glory. A martial hymn, calling the people to vigilance against sin and predicting blessings and triumphs.
* Noon service, service of just living. Offerings of deeds accomplished and trials of strength.
* Dusk song to [[Loran Hae]]: Carefully the Sheaves. A song of warning and of careful work, of preparation against oncoming Night.
* Dusk service, service of deeds accounted. Contracts are signed and witnessed, including marriages. Sins are confessed before the congregation and penalties assessed. This is the time when the larger homilies are given by the ranking priest, this is the best-attended service in most Orthodox communities. 
* Midnight prayer to [[Melara]]. No song, no talking, only the tolling of the bell 16 times, once per minute. 16 minutes of reflection and memory of the past and pleas for mercy. 
* Midnight service, service of memory. Only on Holy Days. The community (in parts or together depending on size) marches around to the graveyards and recites the names of those that died that year. Those who lost family shed a token blood sacrifice (a single drop of blood from a fingertip) on the grave.

=== Wedding Ceremony ===
Weddings are important ritual events in the Church of the Seasons. Weddings among the faithful have three major parts: the pre-ceremony Offeratory, the Oathtaking ceremony itself, and the post-Oathtaking Blessings. There is a fourth part that is more cultural than ceremonial, but just as important: the feast.

==== Offeratory ====
The Offeratory occurs during the day preceding the Oathtaking itself. It consists of ritual prayers offered at dawn (to [[Sakara]], offering the innocence of youth and a promise to love one another), noon (to [[Tor Elan]], offering a vow to defend one another and defend the righteous), dusk (to [[Loran Hae]], offering a vow to work hard at marriage and at life, as well as a vow to uphold the community), and midnight (to [[Melara]], pleading for a merciful heart and the willingness to forgive one another). At this time, the four are ritually invited to the Blessings ceremony by placing unlit candles at each of their shrines and intoning "Gods of Life and Death, gods of Seasons Four, we invite your presence and blessings on our holy day". It is said that if the candles spontaneously take fire, a representative of the god will attend. This is rumor; the presiding priest (usually either a Moon-scythe or a Blossom Maiden) represents the gods ceremonially to deliver the blessings. 

==== Oathtaking ====
This is the actual wedding ceremony. It consists of a priest (representing the gods) who asks the couple a series of questions and binds them to vows (the same vows presented during the offeratory the day before). Also at this ceremony, a representative of each of the bride and groom are called on to be Defenders, to stand ceremonial watch over the couple and pledge their honor in their defense. This is usually either a sibling or a parent.

==== Blessings ====
After the Oathtaking, the priest (or divine representative if one should deign to appear) offers the Blessings of the Gods on the new couple, along with a warning. Generally, those Blessings and Warnings are adapted to the individual couple. Common themes include:

* [[Sakara]]: A blessing of fertility and joy in each other. A warning not to let fear or selfishness tear them apart.
* [[Tor-Elan]]: A blessing of strength and of shelter. A warning to keep to the truth and to be honorable and true to one another.
* [[Loran Hae]]: A blessing of fruitful labors (ie productive farming or business). A warning to treat everyone with fairness and to keep your bargains, lest you be destroyed.
* [[Melara]]: A blessing of health, that they (and their children) die not before their time. A warning to remember all their ancestors and the sufferings and toils they went through.

==== Feast ====
Weddings are serious business, and serious business needs serious feasting. This lasts the rest of the day and often into the night and next day.

== Festivals ==
Four major and four minor festivals are observed throughout both Orthodox and Reformed branches. As is appropriate for a seasonally-based church, these are tied to the height of each season (major festivals) and to the boundaries between seasons (minor festivals). The major festivals are also associated with one of the Seasonal Four. During festivals, all unnecessary work stops.

=== Festival Calendar ===

==== Day of Beginnings (Spring Dawning 1) ====
The festival of the new year is one of the great joyous times. Here the faithful celebrate the end of winter and the dawning of the light. This is a time of community enjoyment, rather than religious fervor, although the Dawn service has special significance on this day. Communities start the day by singing Dawn of Love Triumphant ''en masse;'' the rest of the day mainly revolves around feasting, with honey cakes and other sweets.

==== Life's Rebirth (Vernal Equinox, Rebirth 14-17) ====
Holy to [[Sakara]], goddess of spring and growth, this is the planting festival and a celebration of new life and romantic love. Babies born during the past year are officially named and presented to the community. Bonds of fidelity are loosed during this festival, as is decorum. This is one of the two major festivals for [[halflings]] as well as the [[puun ihmisia]]. The festival involves Dawn service each day as well as singing Sakara's liturgy throughout the day.

==== Day of Light (Summer Dawning 1) ====
The birth of summer is marked by bonfires.

==== Life's Strength (Summer Solstice, High Summer 14-17) ====
Sacred to [[Tor-Elan]], god of summer, the sun, and strength, this is the time of choosing new leaders. Outside the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]], this is when new nobility are crowned across the [[Sea of Grass]]. Marked by mock combats, this is one of the major festivals of the young [[Humans|human]] and [[dragonborn]] males. At least one of the days is spent in militia training under the direction of the [[Sun Shields]].

==== Day of Choice (Autumn Dawning 1) ====
This is the day when the destinies of young people are decided throughout the former [[Council Lands]], although much of the significance is lost outside of the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]]. In that theocracy, children are assigned to their trade masters at age 8; betrothals are solemnized, and debts are accounted. This is a solemn day, marked by judicial actions and punishments. Dusk service on this day is the significant time of confession of sins.

==== Life's Reward (Autumnal Equinox, High Harvest 14-17) ====
[[Loran Hae]]'s festival, this is the harvest-tide. This is a time when debts are called due, when ritual sacrifice of animals and token shedding of blood (cuts on the finger) seal the ground against the coming winter and seal bargains made. Very little merriment. This is the other major halfling festival, although it is significant also for humans.

==== Day of Silence (Winter Dawning 1) ====
This is a quiet time of reflection and preparation for the coming cold and for the new year. A time for families to gather and quietly make things right, to put away old grudges and bind up the wounds. No services are held except the midnight service, where communities gather in silence while the largest bell tolls 16 times, once per minute. No homily or song is given.

==== Life's Memory (Winter Solstice, Slumber 14-17) ====
This festival at the depths of winter, sacred to [[Melara]], lady of merciful death and patron of the honored dead, is a solemn remembrance of those who have passed. At midnight on the 16th, the community gathers in the graveyard and repeats the names of those who have passed on during the year. At the end, those who have served their sentences for crimes are considered "dead" to those crimes, ritually absolved of the guilt. This is a major festival among humans and [[gwerin]], who otherwise do not get involved in the ritual life much.

==Reformed Branches==
The reformed branches follow much the same patterns, minus the public confession of (most) sins. They do not accept the authority of the Ecclesiarchs and High Priests, although HKR-trained priests are generally welcome if they restrain their fanatic impulses.

After the [[Green Zone]], it was the first warded district to be reclaimed from the native hostile undead and demon cults in 210 AC. Since then it has been partially rebuilt. It is occupied by three groups--the [[Sin Eaters]], the [[Kaelthian Merchant Collective]], and the [[Sages]] Guild. It also contains the [[Portal Network]] entry and exit node. It is considered a green/safe zone--attacks by remaining creatures are very rare, even in unclaimed regions (which are still mostly in ruins and haven't been fully scavenged).

      <text bytes="6433" sha1="8ael6cun7hkztfengy0qfxapokehmfw" xml:space="preserve">For many [[gwerin]] in western [[Noefra]], their House is central to their social standing and life. Houses come in two levels of social status--High and Minor. The High Houses are those with history, wealth, and power (arcane and/or political). The members of the High Houses consider themselves nobility, even if they do not have formal titles in the surrounding governments. The Minor Houses act as vassals to the High Houses--each High House owns the allegiance of between 3 and 10 Minor Houses. Outside these are the Unhoused, the common gwerin.

Since the fall of the [[Council Lands]], the direct power of the High Houses has diminished. Some of them have acquired titles of formal nobility within the [[Crisial Kingdom]], while others are significant landowners and keepers of major businesses (especially in the world of magic). One house, House Tuathail, has rejected the whole nobility thing and has cloistered itself within the [[Crystal Spire]]'s wall, devoting themselves to the study of that bizzare structure.

The High Houses are small, consisting of only 10-20 full members and a smattering of children and Unproven.

==House Ranks==
Within each House, the members are carefully ranked based on convoluted internal politics. Everyone knows their status, and jockeying for status is a persistent passtime for many members of the High Houses. Common ranks include:

; Housemaster : The Housemaster is the acknowledged leader of the House. Usually the eldest male (although sometimes younger ones with significant magical power but little political aptitude), his role is primarily ceremonial. He is addressed as "Father", and formally everyone defers to his wisdom. In practice, the Housemaster is a figurehead.
; Matriarch : The eldest female of the natural children of the House (not including contract wives), the Matriarch rarely appears to do anything, but she is the second-most powerful person in the House. She rules the women's world and decides matters of marriage and childbearing. Beware the furrowed brow of the Matriarch!
; First Staff : The First Staff is the real leader. His is the final say on all the important decisions, and his word is absolute in all things except marriage contracts (a right belonging to the Matriarch).
; Aer (son of the house) : Pronounced A-er (two syllables), these are the remaining adult males. While age is important, magical power and political aptitude are also vital to ranking highly within the category of aer.
; Tlysau (daughter of the house) : Pronounced as TLEH-sa, these are the remaining adult females not currently contracted outside the house. Although their struggles tend to be less visible than those of the aer, they are not a whit the less real or hard fought. One source of prestige here is having good contract marriages on record with healthy children.
; Unproven : These are those that are physically adults but have not done their duty to the House by fulfilling a fruitful contract. They have little status, and are constantly vying for promising contract marriages.
; Child : Male or female, those who have not mastered the rudiments of magic are not adult. With the lengthy history of inbreeding, healthy children of the High Houses are precious and frequently spoiled.

==Description of the Houses==
; House Arlwyd : The current highest-rank House among the 8 High Houses. The First Staff of Arlwyd, [[Geoffrey sur Arlwydd]], serves also as Lord Mayor of [[Crisial of the Four Towers]], the second-rank noble (behind the Queen herself) in the [[Crisial Kingdom]]. A longstanding supporter of the [[Gardeners]] party, they have bent their xenophobia in recent years and embraced the changes that Queen [[Raanee]] has brought. Their wealth comes from the discovery and refinement of cold-boxes which allow perishable goods to be shipped and stored for much longer.
; House Golau : The fifth-rank House, Golau has long tradition but has struggled to adapt to the new ways. Noted for being one of the least friendly toward womens' rights. They are firm [[Gardeners]].
; House Hawal : Ranked sixth, Hawal has devoted its efforts to the upkeep and maintenance of the [[Towers of Sun, Earth, Moon, and Stars]]. Almost entirely apolitical, they value academic scholarship over straight magical power. They are neither [[Gardeners]] nor members of the [[Arcanists' Union]].
; House Iledrith : Ranked eigth, House Iledrith is the only High House who did not move to [[Southshore]]. They remained in [[Kaelthia]] and have thrown their support behind the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]]. While not outcast from larger [[gwerin]] society, they are in strong disfavor.
; House Riain : Ranked fourth, Riaian are the rivals to Golau and have seen their fortunes rise while Golau have fallen. Unique among the High Houses, their public leader is their Matriarch, Bronwyn sur Riain and they are known for being "perverse" in giving women equal rights in the House and even supporting egalitarianism with the Houses Minor (but not the Unhoused of course). They are the Queen's firmest supporters and are members of neither of the factions. 
; House Seren : Ranked third and smallest of the houses (with 6 adults), Seren's power belies their small size. Their First Staff, Selen sur Seren is the sponsor of the notorious [[Selan's Seekers]] adventuring company. He is also the the head of the [[Arcanists' Union]]. His wealth comes from controlling the only widespread communication network in the [[Federated Nations]] outside of the [[Adventurer's Guild]]. 
; House Tuathail : As mentioned above, seventh-ranked Tuathail are the masters of the [[Crystal Spire]]...or rather its caretakers. They rarely venture outside the walls except on contract marriages, but they are prized partners for frequently introducing new, previously-unseen traits into bloodlines gone thin from inbreeding. They are members of the [[Arcanists' Union]]. 
; House Tywyll : Ranked second, Tywyll are the only house to have made their mark in the mercantile trade. Specifically, they own and operate the ships that carry goods and people between [[Crisial of the Four Towers]], [[Rauviz]], and [[Rabbiton]]. They have also ventured into overland trade recently. The largest house at 25, they are [[Gardeners]] but have a relaxed attitude toward people of other races and have even been known to allow sharp-ears to contract marriage into the house.

* Feudal Monarchy with three racially-based sub-parts (each with their own system)
* [[Dragonborn]] are aristocratic clans. See the individual clan pages for details: [[Anu]], [[Byarsh]], [[Khor]], [[Gal]], [[Shakti]], and [[Syra]].
* [[Orcs]] are tribal "flat" societies under a war-leader and shaman. See the individual tribe pages for details: [[Tabar]], [[Kard]], [[Skem]], [[Ko]], [[Unclaimed (Tribe)]]
* [[Goblins]] are tribal and communitarian, with little structure to their society. Tribes are based on ideas and beliefs, not heredity.

==Peoples==
* Dragonborn. Minority, but hold official power. Roughly 30%
* Orcs. Plurality, but most are content to participate at the edges. Roughly 35%
* Goblins. Roughly 30%. Little direct power, but they prefer it that way.
* Others, including [[barbegazi]] and [[jazuu]] from the [[Nocthean Caldera]]. Roughly 5%. Somewhat second-class citizens.

See [[Wyrmhold Religion]] for more details. Pluralistic, mostly on racial lines. 

==Culture==
* Organized and warlike.
* Expansionist (mostly to the Caldera, but also into [[Fiach Wood]])

      <text bytes="6700" sha1="4omfydfic3d6ad2giirskwqjykvhkqp" xml:space="preserve">Like the Council, the Dynasty's religious life is split among the three major cultural groups. Dragonborn are the most conventionally religious, while goblins are the least.

==Religion among the dragon clans==
The religious habits of the dragonborn are mixed. For those who grew up in the harsh lands of the [[Kairen Mountains]], religion is about ritual. Those who immigrated with the host from the [[Council Lands]] as adults still largely keep to the ways of the mystery cults, but that has largely died out by 250 AC. Neither group pays more than passing attention to kami or ascended heroes. The race is too young for these stories to be strong, and their artificial origin has left them a bit disconnected from the spirits of nature.

Each clan, while accepting all of the [[Congregation]], associates themselves with a smaller number of Congregants and demigods, called the clan’s lares.

===Religion as Ritual===
Those that concern themselves mostly with ritual believe that deeds are more important than thoughts. Specifically, the Congregation is to be worshiped through exact ritual patterns, the performance of which with sincere intent brings a connection to the gods and thus blessings. Thus, exact religious observances and laws are learned and followed. This learning of deontologias (codes of conduct) and teletourgia (ceremonial practices) relating to the lares is a mandatory part of children’s schooling. Reading and writing are learned in this context. Often this is the only formal schooling a non-noble will have. Conducted by the Dydaskalos, the priest/schoolmaster for the clan, this involves repetition, memorization, recitation, and harsh discipline until its learned at the subconscious level.

Each of the lares are divided into several groups: lares major (the two divinities who form the focus of the family’s worship), lares minor (the 3-6 divinities that play supporting roles), and the lares inimicii (those 2-4 divinities that are considered enemies or foils for the lares major). These divisions are based on tradition and esotericism and so are not consistent from clan to clan (or even within families of a clan).

Normally, the teletourgia are broken into two types: public ceremonies and private observances. Ceremonies are ritual sacrifices or performances (depending on the lare in question) performed at a day and time set aside for that deity. Lares major have weekly (collective) ceremonies, lares minor have seasonal ceremonies, and lares inimicii have a single day devoted to them collectively (the Day of Appeasement). Each clan considers different days holy, so in a multi-clan city like [[Lyodnoir]] every day might be sacred to someone and the same god might be worshiped on every day. When a Day of Appeasement falls on a holy day, that day is considered “cursed” and no business can be conducted that day for those whose clan it is.

Observances are done to one of the lares to whom the individual or family feels most connected—they involve night and/or morning ablutions, meal-time rituals, even things said or done when one enters certain buildings or performs certain tasks. These vary wildly between individuals and are developed by family tradition or individual inspiration.

For the main clans, here is a list of the lares major and lares inimicii with their holy days in parentheses.

Dragonborn clerics, divine soul (and other) sorcerers, and celestial warlocks are quite common and respected. Dragonborn also tend toward the Oaths of a paladin more than most. They are not generally drawn to the arcane or the druidic magics.

==Religion Among the Orcish Tribes==
To the orcs of Wyrmhold, the Congregation is but one of many Powers that should be venerated, and not the most important. Orc tribes tend to first focus on their ancestors by making ritual (or animal) sacrifices to them in times of need, celebration or solemnity. Then they appease the kami through their shamans. Certain of the Congregation are held in similar esteem—they more seek to avoid the wrath of the gods rather than seeking their aid.

Orcish clerics are rare, as are divine soul sorcerers. They tend to the bardic, shamanistic, and druidic arts more than anything.

==Religion Among the Goblins==
Goblins treat religion like they do technology, fashion, and most other things. As something to experiment with. As a source of fads. Systematic worship is not something they do very much (although individuals differ). Others complain that they worship with their heads, not their hearts. They’ll mix and match prayers and rituals, keeping the parts that seem to work (for a while) and dropping the others. As religious power depends on faith, this mostly doesn’t work.

As for what they worship, they’ll worship anything and everything. They don’t usually have their own ancestors to venerate or tell stories of, but they’ll worship someone else’s ancestors, the local kami, gods, demigods, or random things people make up. “Selling an icon to a goblin” is an idiom much akin to taking candy from a baby, something trivial and a bit shameful.

Most goblin magic, therefore, is based around the arcane (or occasionally the shamanistic arts). Bards are particularly common, with most of the tribal shamans really using words and rhythms to influence their people rather than clerical or druidic magic. With the birth of technological magic (the savants and artificers), many goblins are turning that way for power.

==Multi-racial Churches==
Since the fall of the [[Hungering Frost]], the religious aspirations of the people have changed. As a partial result, there have arisen cults, sects, and other religious organizations that cross racial and cultural lines.

* The [[Breath of the Sun]] -- Dedicated to [[Tor Elan]], this is a militant organization centered around the [[Dawnspire]], a fortress, monastery, and armed camp outside of [[Lyodnoir]] into the mountains.

      <text bytes="1654" sha1="sgd2yhovnf8a11m1ywka8t5lvc3elgm" xml:space="preserve">Barbegazi, or frost goblins, are a sub-species of goblins associated with the [[Plane of Ice]]. Much like the genasi (who are humans strongly influenced by one of the elemental planes), the barbegazi show significant effects of exposure to areas high in [[Source of Magic|umbral water]]. A few of these are detailed below under the section Racial Traits. On the [[Noefra]]n continent, they are primarily found in the [[Kairen Mountains]] and [[Nocthean Caldera]] regions. Their ancestors followed the [[Hungering Frost]] from the [[Plane of Ice]] and then were abandoned when the frost collapsed in 211 AC. Tribes remain one of the major players on the Caldera. Some have allied with [[Wyrmhold]] for protection, but most remain independent and territorial.

== Racial Traits ==
Barbegazi stand slightly taller than "regular" goblins, averaging between 3'4" and 4'5". They are also bulkier and tend more toward the muscular than regular goblins. Like goblins, they have a tribal shared unconscious/memory; unlike "true" goblins, they are more detached and more conscious of this sharing and can, with effort, filter information. This allows their tribes to be more stable. Unlike regular goblins, they cannot easily produce hobgoblins or bugbears. They all are at home in cold climates and less affected by supernatural cold (such as the breath of a white dragon). Some barbegazi show outright ice-related abilities, including the ability to flash-freeze those who attack them in close combat.

Magically, barbegazi tend much more toward the arcane than most goblins. This is especially true of the tribes of the [[Nocthean Caldera]].

      <text bytes="5449" sha1="h2r78hqr6i7dnihr0k3me7sugapv57a" xml:space="preserve">Who were the shadowy forces behind the endless tide of frozen invaders from the [[Nocthian Caldera]]? Why do they hate the [[dragonborn]] of [[Wyrmhold]] so much?

Originating deep in [[Mount Nyx]], the dormant volcano at the heart of the [[Nocthian Caldera]], a swarm of creatures large and small arose every winter to assail the only pass into the eastern lands beyond the caldera. It was 130 years ago when they swept out of the dark, bringing winter in the heart of Midsummer, leaving the land snow-covered and icy behind them. The first wave was rime wraiths, elemental creatures from the [[Plane of Ice]]. Each wave sapped the heat from the ground and the defenders of the Old Dynasty alike. Following behind them were frost worms--wingless, belly-crawling monstrosities that breathed shards of ice and whose trails froze the ground down to the bedrock--and frost giants, 25' tall, blue-skinned, rune-adorned merciless warriors who swept the dragonborn before them. Broken, the survivors of this assault retreated down the [[Last Resort Pass]], a 70-mile stretch of mountains once carved by a mighty river, now frozen solid at the source. They managed to turn the tide at great cost at the head of the pass, and the two fought over those first few miles for more than 90 years. In 211 AC, a group of adventurers struck a mighty blow at the dragon [[Xol'cerd]] and the ritual powering the tide of winter magic, bringing the threat of the Frost to an end. The next spring, the [[Wild Cards]] struck down [[Isskap]] herself, putting an end to its chill reign forever.

==Leadership==
The ultimate driving force behind the Hungering Frost resided in the [[Plane of Ice]]. The Titan [[Isskap]], betrayer of the [[Titan Conclave]] and wielder of the [[Orb of All Might|Disc of Remembering]] had retreated there and transcended her mortality. After the [[Cataclysm]], she took control of the plane and began plotting to regain the rest of the Orb. She is driven by a desire to see her children, preserved by the power of [[Broken Order]] against the degeneration inevitable to all titan-kin after the First Wish, restored to life and ascended to godhood. The sacrifices necessary to preserve them and herself have left them tainted by the Abyss; she needs a focus of runic power to banish the taint and catapult them to ascension. Until that day, she maintains effectual control over the plane and its inhabitants, although she constantly must fend off rebellion and undermining by her vassals. Her ability to act directly on the mortal plane is limited--if she pushes too hard, she'll incur the wrath of the 3rd Celestial Legion contingent stationed in the Plane of Water.

The day-to-day command of the forces of the Frost resides with [[Xol'cerd]], an adult white dragon. As a wyrmling, her brother was killed by adventurers in the days leading up to the [[Cataclysm]]. [[Isskap]] came to her with his soul trapped in a skull and bent her mind toward vengeance against the dragonborn (under the pretext that the killers were dragonborn). [[Xol'cerd]] vowed to destroy all dragonborn in retaliation. She hoarded any and all magic items she could.

The other forces were commanded from the [[Plane of Ice]]
* The jazuu were under the command of Gripnir, a brainwashed Frost Giant. He committed suicide after the fall of Isskap. 
* The [[barbegazi]] were under the command of Hnrimnir. After the fall of Isskap, he and his extraplanar forces retreated into the wilds of the plane.
* The monsters were under the influence of Fenrir, a colossal Winter Wolf ascendant. She served under duress and has returned to her wild ways away from civilization.


The jazuu and barbegazi left in the Caldera reverted to their tribal ways. Some oppose the returning mortals; others have allied with them. The beasts remain a threat, but diminished. Many of the lupine ones have joined barbegazi and jazuu tribes.

==Forces==
The forces of the Hungering Frost were of several kinds: the goblinoids, the jazuu, and the beasts.

The bulk of the forces are ice goblins, called barbegazi. Larger and more solid than regular goblins, these goblins have traded much of the racial memory and ability to create hobgoblins for individual prowess and hardiness. They rode wargs and partner with winter wolves. They also build the siege equipment used against the Wall and form most of the raiding parties into Dynastic territory.

The jazuu have migrated via portal from Oelfra. Born to fight, the frost giants are few in number but individually powerful. Along with them are several hill giants, stone giants, and many ogres and trolls. A host of goliaths also came, but served in a support role and were not directly involved in combat. 

The local beasts, spearheaded by the ice wurms, were under the direct command of Xol'cerd.

==The Desire==
The entire point of this invasion was to obtain three items, parts of the [[Orb of All Might]]. First is the [[Orb of All Might|Disc of Binding]], said to be in the possession of the [[Khaimal]] dwarves in [[Hammerhead]]. A strong force of goblins and jazuu was sent against them, but that resulted in a stalemate. Second was the [[Orb of All Might|Core of Strength]], found in the regalia of the dragonborn kings in [[Wyrmhold]]. Thus the constant attacks and attempts at infiltration. The third was the [[Orb of All Might|Disc of Summoning]], reputed to be somewhere in dragonborn territory.

She hated the [[dragonborn]] for centuries as a result of manipulation by [[Isskap]]. The Frost Titan secretly encouraged her brother (as a wyrmling) to raid the area to the west of the Caldera in the year before the [[Cataclysm]]. She then manipulated a party of adventurers (the [[Divine Three]]) to cross his path and destroy him. Since several of them were dragonborn, she was able to manipulate Xol'cerd into swearing blind vengeance on all dragonborn. Her brother's soul imprint was trapped in his skull by [[Isskap]] and served as an unwilling advisor to the [[Hungering Frost]] until freed by the [[Wild Cards]].

Occurring on 23 Summer Dawning, 217 AC, it started when a unit of Council troops moved toward the [[Crystal Spire]] on their way to garrison [[Crisial of the Four Towers|Crisial City]], then known as Yuuras Zaali. The locals, fearing that the troops were actually coming to institute repressive measures against the liberalized local populace, formed a small army and met them in the shadow of the Spire, intent on repelling them. Before the two sides could enter pitched combat, special forces from the [[Adventurer's Guild]], including the [[Wild Cards]], the [[Catalysts]], and a trio of dragons ([[Marcia (Dragon) | Marcelline]], [[Pygmis Neris]], and [[Atijok]]), as well as the ''[[Flying Free]]'' airship descended from the skies and coerced both sides into coming to a peace agreement. The only casualty was one Council soldier, who released his bowstring in his shock at their arrival and cut his wrist badly.

==Events leading up to the war==
* migration of gwerin to Crisial City
* Death of dwarven representatives
* Revelation that the [[Oracles]] were completely corrupt
* Corrupt selection of new Mining rep.
* Proclamation of new "law and order" push, as well as new production quotas for regions.
* Growing disaffection with Council/Guild system

==Results of the peace treaty==
* End of council governance.
* Renaming nation to "Republic of Federated Free Peoples" (a democratic parliamentary republic)
* Capital moved to Rauviz
* reduction in status of Temple, Academy
* abolition of guilds as official powers

==Religion==
See [[Queen Ascendant]]. Common folk and ophidians are quite devout, upper castes pay lip service. Many of the wealthy worship Kela Loran or Aerielara. Perversions including demon (Barbed Rose, mainly) and devil worship (Mara) are rumored among the upper crust.

==Leadership==
The official ruler of Asai'ka is Phraya Sel Ichiban, second child of former Phraya [[Hvang Ssa'ka]]. About 40 years old, he is a vain, petty noble obsessed with popularity among the isal caste and wealth. Fortunately, his direct power, although theoretically absolute, is quite limited. Instead, power really belongs with the Board of the [[Benevolent Organization]].

===The Benevolent Organization===
Main Article: [[Benevolent Organization]]

Founded before the liberation of the [[Queen Ascendant]] as a band of underworld actors looking to regularize their territories, the Organization has grown into the shadow leadership of the nation. All criminal, and much of the legitimate business passes through the hands of Organization members. They also provide the police force and lend money to priest-bureaucrats, nobles, and merchants alike. This money lending is the main way they maintain power. The Organization, despite being a loose alliance of nefarious types, is held together by the oversight of the Board.

The Board is composed of a representative from each of the major power bases in the nation, and their word is absolute. The identities of the Board Members are not officially public, but are a widely-known secret. The Members are
* Phra Phel Solkan. An older half-elf, he married Lady Kagome Ssa'ka, Phraya Ichiban's older sister. When she and their daughter died of suspected poison in the chaos surrounding her father's death, he became the power behind Phraya Ichiban. He's been on the Board since 220 AC. In most cases, he takes the leadership role.
* Lai So Lender. A hard-faced woman in her 70s, So is the owner of the largest chain of banking houses throughout the [[Jungle of Fangs]]. Immensely rich, she sees everything in mercantile terms, in terms of profit and loss. Even lives are but counters in a ledger. She represents the lai caste. The senior member of the Board, she's been there since the Liberation.
* Senior Scrivener Jashan. Officially, he's merely a mid-ranking scribe with the priest-bureaucracy. In truth, he's the leader of the dominant faction, the Scales of the Goddess. Although he is devoted to increasing the power and prestige of the Temple to the point of austerity publicly, he isn't averse to living a sybaritic life in private. It's said that he prefers men for partners...or rather boys, the younger the better. Other, hastily suppressed whispers talk of darker desires and appetites. At 35, he's the youngest member of the Board.
* Mugen the Knife. A retired assassin, he represents the criminal element. Little is known about this man due to his intense obsession with privacy. What is known is that he heads up the enforcement arm. Of all of the Board Members, he's reputed to be the most concerned with the common good and the least corrupt.

Fang-kin are devout worshipers of the [[Queen Ascendant]], as are more "civilized" ophidians. They do not acknowledge the authority of the priests at [[Ar Salem Dolem]] and have their own hierarchy. "Wild" ophidians practice kami-veneration.

==Culture==

==Economy==
;Exports: Fish
;Imports: TODO

==International relationships==
* Generally good, but limited.
* Only major contact is with the [[Ship People]]--they've developed a detente.

==Leadership==
The current Phraya (King, roughly) is Isal [[Hvang Srey]]. Adopted daughter of the former Phraya, Isal [[Sat'psa Balin]], she was victorious in the selection competition that ended at the time of the [[Battle of Kel'al'ar]] in 211 AC. Now in her mid 70s, she hasn't softened much. She still rules with an eye to practicality and profit. Her heir is her second daughter, [[Hvang Puo]].

The other contestants that survived the selection competition have since passed away--two from natural causes (Isals [[Sat'psa Dara]] and [[Sat'psa Vanna]]) and Isal [[Sat'psa Leng]] who was executed for leading the [[Devil's Rebellion]] in 211 AC.

Incarnated by the [[Titan Conclave]] as part of the construction and empowerment of the [[Orb of All Might]]. [[Isskap]] made a deal with it for power, and then betrayed and enslaved that incarnation. She kept her powers by drawing on its energies, feeding it on the souls of the Conclave and others she captured. That incarnation was eventually embedded in [[Ymir]] and then destroyed by the [[Wild Cards]] in their battle against [[Isskap]] and [[Ymir]].

The concept itself has not been destroyed or absorbed; pieces of its power and influence can still be felt. The Sages consider it a [[Risk Categories|Category S]] threat. It's power was also summoned by Rane's parents to produce the stasis effect that kept her and her aide safe for eons at the cost of their own existence.

And yet exist?

--Jaern of Stars, ca 52 AC, recorded in ''On Names and Natures''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;One of the original Primordials, the Nameless embodied change and growth. For reasons unknown (although likely linked to the [[Awakener]]), the Nameless and those that followed it rebelled before the creation of the world was finished. The resulting conflict, the [[Dawn War]], ended with the imprisonment of the Nameless and his chief lieutenants, the [[Broken Concept]]s, in the [[Abyss]] and the present ordering of the planes. His lesser followers were banished to the newly-formed Mortal plane; some were further confined into [[Aenimos]] ([[Echidra]] and her brood) or [[Perdatos]] (those followers most warped by the unchecked energies of chaos).

The Nameless was summoned into the [[Mortal]] world in 1 BC by a power-seeking wizard, who was promptly subsumed by that ancient entity, now maddened by his aeon-long imprisonment in the void of the [[Abyss]]. The Nameless, now embodied, gathered all the "evil" races and swept over [[Noefra]] like a devouring wave. This conflict, the [[Cataclysm War]], ended when the [[Divine Three]] detonated the [[Eyes of Qa'desh|Left Eye of Qa'desh]]; in the resulting [[planar realignment]], the other Primordials, incarnated in response to its awakening, sacrificed themselves using the [[Fangs of Resolution]]. Their sacrifice wrought a change that accepted the Nameless (and the essence of change and freedom) into the universe, completing the work of creation and bringing the [[Dawn War]] to a final close. As a consequence, all beings now have free will. Some of the [[Broken Concept]]s still remain imprisoned; others joined the Nameless in his anmesty.

      <text bytes="1503" sha1="0jfijqx3z0kflh124j16xo3c1z4r5v7" xml:space="preserve">A collection of artifact daggers. Each one is about 16 inches long and curved (as if made from the fang or claw of a gigantic creature). They appear to be made of ivory or bone, but are impossible to destroy by ordinary means. They can be told apart by the symbols engraved in the butt--ancient runes for numbers. In total, 8 have been identified. 

The Fangs, despite appearing to be daggers, are incapable of harming a creature or cutting anything, except in one specific case. If pressed into a surface, they pass through it as if incorporeal. They will sit in a sheath. No interaction with normal matter is possible--the Fangs appear to be completely harmless.

When an intelligent creature picks one up, however, they suddenly understand the singular use of these daggers. When driven into the wielder's own heart, with full intent, knowingly and willingly accepting the consequences, the Fang will absorb the wielder's life force, extinguishing their Spark and destroying their body completely. The wielder's last wish, if expressed with full conviction of soul, will then come to pass. The wielder can never be returned to existence--they do not pass on into [[Shadow]] and not even the most powerful magic can contact them. They no longer exist.

It is said that these were the inspiration for the first wizards to develop the spell ''wish'', which pales in comparison to the potential of these daggers but does not carry nearly the same cost.

;Usual depiction: A night's child woman of indeterminate age. Not particularly plain, but in her eyes dance the stars. Statues often depict her holding the moons (in crescent form), one in each hand.

;Worship: Worshiped dominantly by the night's children of [[Byssia]], her worship consists of prayers, dances (always at night), and whispered secrets told to her priestesses. Her servants are always female.

;Religious Precepts: Keep secrets safe. Arcane magic is dangerous unless tightly controlled--bind the wizard and the sorcerer. Women bear the moons in their blood and so are better suited to rule in the mysteries. Calm demeanors are best.

=== Elphane Heresy ===
In late 251, a heresy started spreading, seemingly without source, among the [[Byssia|byssians]] of the [[Nocthian Caldera]]. It spoke of a time early on in Nocthis's ascended life, where she was a powerful arcanist and not yet ascended. Instead, she served her (ascended) husband, a male deity named Elphas, whose aspects were justice, rebirth, and the moons. This heresy states that Nocthis betrayed Elphas and stole his divinity, ascending herself at the same time she imprisoned Elphas in a burning hellscape prison, there locked in stasis for all eternity...until someone freed him.

;Rank 0--normal beings : Mortals, low-ranking infernals, "normal" residents of the elemental planes, low-ranking demons. Also the Faded--those ascendants who have lost most of their power stream and subsist on dribs and drabs. Those are some of the most dangerous beings, because they'll risk anything to regain their former status.
;Rank 1--minor ascendants : These beings have a steady and stable stream of power, but little overall influence on the Mortal. Mid-ranking [[infernals]], contractors and lesser demon lords rank here, as do many of the [[ascended heroes]] and a few of the [[Elemental lord|elemental lords]]. These are still very killable. There is a wide range of powers in this category.
;Rank 2--major ascendants : These beings have a steady and strong stream of power and wield significant influence on the Mortal, but lack the depths of power of a god or demigod. Infernal dons and [[demon Princes|demon princes]] fall into this category, as do many elemental lords. Killing one of these is incredibly difficult, as they can reform due to their influx of power.
;Rank 3--minor demigods : These servants of the [[Congregation]] wield their patron's power but have only limited responsibilities or roles (and wield correspondingly limited power). Destroying one of these is possible, but will call down the wrath of their patron.
;Rank 4--major demigods : These are the primary servants of the [[Congregation]]. They wield most of the power of their patron, and are the ones responsible for acting in the mortal realm on behalf of their god. Beings such as the [[Archon of Time]] also fit into this category (being fed by the [[Great Mechanism]] but not being a congregant. Destroying one of these is nearly impossible unless they are rejected by their patron.
;Rank 5--congregants : All the members of the [[Congregation]] have the same theoretical power--nearly infinite in their domain, but strongly constrained. Destroying one of these is impossible. The [[Great Mechanism]] will not allow it (although it can absorb them if it needs to, as it did the [[Old Gods]]). There are always 16 of these, no more, no fewer.

      <text bytes="1651" sha1="1hnzo8ftmlf53y66ka4qu67bn3lgqw4" xml:space="preserve">Raised in the [[Nocthian Caldera]], Thon was one of two sons of the chief of the Mountain-break clan. This clan broke with the [[Hungering Frost]] after the construction of the Frostbound Wall (206 AC). Thon and his older brother [[Brom Mountain-break]] were endlessly in competition. Brom hated Thon after Thon won a contest against him. After becoming disaffected when he wasn't given leadership rights, Brom made a deal with elements of the Frost, and led them in secretly. Other than Thon, the entire clan was killed. Thon was exiled in mockery (to live with shame).

Thon swore vengeance against Brom, made his way out of the Caldera and ended up joining the [[Adventurer's Guild]] in late 210 AC. After finishing training, he and the rest of the [[Wild Cards]] were assigned to explore the area beyond the [[Hammerhead]] Portal. See the campaign pages for more details.

Later in life, he settled down as lord of [[Zhapai Karmap]]. He has been promised that, once he dies (assuming he stays valiant), he will be raised up as an ascended in service to [[Perkunos]], his friend and object of his worship.

;Demographic information : A tall (9'), strongly-built [[jazuu]], Thon wears gaudy golden plate armor and wields a sword of angelic make (Duty Accomplished). His bevy of magical items gives him the strength of a storm giant, as well as letting him jump and create small earthquakes.
;Personality: Arrogant, not smart (but also not willing to acknowledge that). Ready to violence.
;Ideal: Freedom
; Bond : His friends are his family and he'll kill for them.
; Flaw: See chair, sit in chair. Plus bull-headedness.

Formed by the 16 most powerful titans (4 representing each element), the Conclave first met in the aftermath of the First [[Titan-Wyrm War]] (which the Titans lost, badly). They orchestrated the Second [[Titan-Wyrm War]], which ended in a stalemate. Finally, seduced by [[Broken Order]] and [[Isskap]] (who was serving as one of the Conclave members representing Water), the Conclave constructed and empowered the [[Orb of All Might]], with which to fight the Last [[Titan-Wyrm War]]. After being warned of the hubris of this action by [[Perkunos]] and [[Tatsuryuu]], they used the orb to curse them into indefinite imprisonment. 

On use, the Orb shattered (after diminishing both the [[Wyrm]] and the [[Titans]] alike). Hiding in their fortress under [[Skypiercer Peak]], they refused to accept the reality. At this point, they were betrayed by [[Isskap]], who in cahoots with [[Broken Order]] trapped their souls in crystal, draining their power to maintain her children (affected by the diminishment) in stasis until she could find a cure and lift them to godhood.

In 212 AC (tens of thousands of years later), the [[Wild Cards]] met their spirits in [[Kek]], where the Conclave tested them and granted them blessings with the last of their power to destroy [[Isskap]] and [[Broken Order]], thus setting them free.

Bordered by [[Kotimaa]] to the west, the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] to the east, and the [[Dreamwall Mountains]] to the south, it is a large, shallow bay of the Northern Ocean [TODO: rename]]. It rarely reaches more than 100' in depth at any point, and many small islands (former hill-tops and mountains) dot it. Several ruined towers of pre-cataclysm cities poke up from it, but these remain unexplored.

The only major ports on the Sea of Dreams are [[Zhapai Karmap]] and the [[True Hold]], but many villages (both belonging to the [[Duarchy of Kotimaa]] and various unincorporated human and elven villages) can be found on its southern and western edges. There is at least [[mkhulu]] nest under its waters.

Also present in the drowned city of [[Lasiriand]], the former capital of the [[Flower Kingdom]] before it was sunk in the [[Cataclysm]], is the southern stronghold of the [[Grand Northern Alliance]] of sea-folk. Their patrols police the other folk present in the sea, as well as the ruins of the former land-dwelling civilizations. Mostly [[kalasaa]] (although [[weilgoroesi]] and [[ika-ika]] are also present), this outpost is staffed primarily with zealots and traditionalists devoted to [[Leviathan]]. The organization known as the [[Wardens of History]] also maintains one of their prison bastions nearby.

Created to break down flawed or unneeded creations, they were to be the judges of creation, choosing what would remain. To do this, they were given power over the elements via their spoken words and breath, a power later mages called True Sorcery.

Coming in all shapes and sizes and capable of changing their shapes, the wyrm were the masters of the skies. Nearly impossible to injure and ageless, they were much fewer in number than their post-[[Dawn War]] rivals, the [[Titans]], and mostly acted individually. Unlike the Titans, they did not cultivate slaves among the lesser races. They accepted tribute, to be sure, in exchange for protection, but mostly ignored the lesser races as beneath contempt.

They fought 3 wars against the [[Titans]], the three [[Titan-Wyrm War]]s. The first they won handily, the second was a stalemate, and the third ended in destruction for both sides after the [[Orb of All Might]] diminished both their powers and shattered.

After the Last [[Titan-Wyrm War]] and the First Wish, surviving titans and wyrm (now diminishing into giants and dragons) put aside their differences and used the [[Eyes of Qa'desh]] to separate [[Oelfra]] from [[Noefra]].

No wyrm remain at their full original power. The closest is probably [[Alastor, World Judge]], ruler of the [[Plane of Lava]].

      <text bytes="3852" sha1="6uic7uaksxa3p81utbpfacdg2a2ifw1" xml:space="preserve">After the [[Crystal Spire War]] of 217 AC and the dissolution of the guild-based government system in the [[Council Lands]] (now renamed the Republic of Federated Free Peoples), many of the formerly-powerful people were very embittered and disaffected. [[Kaelthia]] lost significant prestige and trade (now that everything flowed through [[Rauviz]] rather than the much more distant former capital) and no longer had the power to control the nation. With the outflow of the [[gwerin]] to [[Southshore]] and the explosive growth of [[Crisial of the Four Towers| Crisial City]], the balance of power was shifting even further away from their grasp.

A decade later, the situation had become intolerable. It was obvious that pretty soon, the remnants of control they still had (primarily influence over trade with [[Fuar Uulan]] and parts east, but also moral suasion in agricultural regions) would vanish as the new generation rose to power and the old faded. Something had to be done, and quick.

Four former Guildmasters gathered in secret and made a plan. This much is public knowledge. [[Darvin Fallowfield]] (of Agriculture) and his [[Committee for Realignment]] (headed by his son [[Daelin Fallowfield]]) took the lead, but [[Ardrik Whiteshield]] of Commerce, [[Yorgri Tsetseg]] (of Mining, he whose corrupt appointment to that mastership triggered the Crystal Spire War), and [[Tome-Master Korthan]] of the Academy also participated. What is less-well known is that the [[Sheaf-binder]] ([[Loran Hae]]'s High Priest) was the driving force behind the scenes, at his god's direct request. Were it not for this priest, the remaining guildmasters would not have dared challenge the nation.

In the late fall of 227 AC, as the ruling Parliament gathered in Rauviz for the start of their winter session, the Guildmasters plan went into motion. Infiltrating the Council Hall with magical explosives stolen from [[Delicate Apocalypse]], they booby-trapped the chamber. When the [[Immortal Bard]], the honorary Head of State, stood up to give his opening remarks (traditionally a few ribald jokes and off-color stories, to be sure), they detonated the explosives. All the representatives were killed; the Bard only survived by the quick reflexes of [[Marcia (Dragon)|Marcelline]], the brass dragon of [[Kaelthia]], who had caught wind of the plot but arrived too late to stop it. She was grievously wounded in the blast, and the Bard (helped by adventurers) spirited her away to a hidden location where she remains in healing slumber to this day.

The results of this act of treason were exactly what [[Sheaf-binder]] expected and desired, but not what the guildmasters wanted. Instead of pinning the blame on [[Zhapai Karmap]], their hand was made obvious and priest-assassins of the [[Hollow King]] hunted them down and assassinated them. But the damage was done. The nation, already weakened by internal divisions and lack of common purpose, shattered. Group turn against group, and civil war of clan against clan, family against family, all against all broke out. This state of unrest and riot lasted for three years, until in the spring of 230 AC, the various factions, weary of war and fearing that the other nations might start lopping off chunks, gathered in the ruins of the Council Hall and signed the [[Treaty of Rauviz]], breaking up the [[Council Lands]] into the [[Successor States]]. Thus ended the Guildmasters and their vile plot.

Why did the Sheaf-binder want this chaos? To bring about the creation of the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]], a nation dedicated to the gods and forged in the fire of war. Steel cannot be made without hammering and flame--the dross must be burnt off and the mettle proven by the blows of the smith. So must a nation undergo adversity until it turns to the gods for leadership.

Also exists throughout much of the [[Federated Nations]], but the two organizations have different leadership. They cooperate as needed, but only with some friction. Their organizational structures and duties are very similar, however.

The Gravewards, although largely peaceful, is a militant order and its members are trained in the use of weapons (especially the shovel-axe which serves as a badge of office as well as a ceremonial and practical tool). Many can cast some form of spell (usually healing or preservation, rarely offensive), but clerics and paladins are few in relative number. Those with full powers (whether Oath-born or channeled) tend to join the Dead-hunters branch. 

==Structure==
Two main arms
* healing/tending graves. The higher-prestige branch.
* Dead-hunters (necromancer-hunters, undead slayers).

==Duties==
* Tend graveyards. Many of the members wander throughout the land, tending and sanctifying graveyards. Others, especially near larger towns, are stationary.
* Hunt necromancers. Those that would defile the dead must be destroyed.
* Heal the wounded and sick, especially of wasting diseases caused by exposure to necromantic or abyssal energies.
* Maintain the records of the people. Records of births, deaths (especially deaths), marriages, and apprenticeships are recorded in rolls kept by the Gravewards.

Not as sheer as the western or southern ranges, the Kairen Mountains are similar to the Rocky Mountains of Earth in height, but much narrower. The average width of the mountainous region is about 70 miles. The area is characterized by tall peaks and narrow forested valleys. The climate is mostly arid (especially in the central section near [[Lyodnoir]]), but significant snow falls during the winter.

It is occupied and heavily settled by the [[dragonborn]] clans of [[Wyrmhold]]. [[Anu]] is most common near the caldera itself, with [[Gal]] and [[Syra]] in the central region and [[Byarsh]] to the south. The northern regions are inhabited lightly by the orcish tribes. At the far north, the mountains open out on the [[Glacial Badlands]], a region of broken terrain left behind by the magical glaciation caused by the [[Hungering Frost]].

The remnants of an ancient, extinct super-volcano, the caldera floor is approximately 500 miles in diameter, with an average altitude of 5000-7000 feet. Strong elemental influences keep the climate inside the caldera habitable, although it is known for heavy snow during the winter.

===Regions===
; [[Wyrmhold Reborn]]: Part of the expansion of [[Wyrmhold]] into its ancestral territories, this includes the ruins of [[Old Wyrmhold]] (still not entirely cleaned out from the undead presence) as well as the surrounding [[jazuu]] and [[barbegazi]] tribal groups. The largest settlement there is at [[Adron's Folly]].
; New Nocthia : [[Byssia]] has expanded through the [[Tunnel of the Ancestors]] into the southern region, with an eye to reclaim the whole caldera for [[Nocthis]]. Their expansion has been slower, in large part due to more hostile surrounding tribes. [[New Nocthia]] is also the name of the largest settlement there.
; Wolf's Head : a tribal alliance of [[barbegazi]] and [[jazuu]], these are heavily hostile to invaders.
; Lake Kyol : a lake composed of runoff. Extremely cold. Home to dangerous creatures. Dominated by the Four Feathers tribe, who are loosely allied with [[Wyrmhold]].
; Ogre Plains : Broad plains in the western portion, occupied mostly by giant-kin.
; Beker Forest : Covering the western edge and extending down the Midnight Pass into the [[Frozen Coast]], these are heavily occupied by [[Jazuu|jazuu tribes]]. They have little contact with outsiders, but are relatively unfriendly and xenophobic.
; Cursed Fens : the swampy area surrounding Mt Nyx is still twisted by the influence of [[Broken Order]]. Strange creatures prowl here and the area is considered taboo to the local tribes.
; Mt Nyx : The central secondary volcano rising from the floor of the caldera. Extensively tunneled, first by the Nocthians during the 3rd Age, then expanded by barbegazi tribes during the occupation by the [[Hungering Frost]]. Many treasures still exist here and in the surrounding ruins of [[Nighthold]]. But access is extremely dangerous.

* [[Wyrmhold]] claims the ancestral [[dragonborn]] kingdom in the north-east portion. Most of the population lives near [[Adron's Folly]] in the southern area, adjacent to Sheepdip territory.
* The Sheepdip goblin tribal alliance is one of the longest-standing allies of [[Wyrmhold]] in the caldera. They allied themselves right after the end of the winter war, mostly out of fear of their larger, more aggressive neighbors. As their name suggests, they're known for sheep.
* The Four Feathers goblin tribal alliance is a more recent ally, having formally allied themselves only a decade or so ago. Ranged around the shores (especially the eastern shore) of Lake Kyol, they're still not very comfortable with outsiders although they trade much in fish as well as artifacts recovered from the lake.
* The Shrikenest goblin tribal alliance is the most recent ally, having allied themselves after the [[Battle of Medvyed]] in mid-late summer 251 AC. Small and fearful of their neighbors (especially the Kiljat to the north), they look to Wyrmhold for defense.
* [[Byssia]] claims the southern central area, although their official borders are much further out than their actual zone of control near the [[Tunnel of the Ancestors]] and [[New Nocthia]] (located at its northern mouth). Their March Wardens patrol the hills out to the Oronar range and often assist with that alliance. They have cordial, although not friendly, dealings with their non-allied neighbors.
* The Oronar are a proud mixed-race group allied fairly tightly with Byssia. They are one of the more "traditional" of the tribal groups, still holding fast to their (imagined) runic traditions of their ancestors.
* The Fenfoot are a small, weak goblin tribe loosely allied with Byssia. They are nervous between the aggressive Wolf's Head and Jaruud tribes, as well as the unsettling swamps of the Cursed Fens.
* The Mountainbreak are a jazuu tribal alliance reborn. Proudly neutral, they will trade with all comers but will not be intimidated by any.
* The Wolf's Head are a mixed tribe, mostly goblin warg riders. They have been convinced by both Byssia and Wyrmhold to allow a trade post on their lands in exchange for binding promises not to invade or meddle.
* The Wurm's Breath are another mixed tribe. Transit through their lands is the most risky part of the trek between the two major nations' territories. They do not like outsiders and require payment...and don't always honor it.
* The [[Jaruud]] are a jazuu tribe, one of the more settled such tribes. They've taken over an old Nocthian city (or the ruins thereof) and will trade. They are growing fast enough to make their neighbors a bit worried, especially as they can't expand through the Fens and are hemmed in by other tribes.
* The Red Ice are a mixed nation forged out of several smaller tribal alliances, formerly led by Zorg, a frost giant dating back to the Winter War. Zorg was killed and much of the fighting-capable force of the nation were either killed or captured at the [[Battle of Medvyed]]. This leaves the fate of the Red Ice rather uncertain.
* Not much is known about the Scalefoot. Recent intelligence suggests that they bear allegiance to a dragon of some kind.
* The [[Sigani]] are known only through the rantings of the [[Deep Mind]] (War, specifically). Said to be "fearsome, dangerous, and advanced. Not to be messed with lightly."
* The Kijat are a mixed jazuu-goblin tribe. The Shrikenest fear them but don't know too much.
* The Feil Bas are almost entirely unknown. War (of the [[Deep Mind]]) claims that they're "demonic remnants of an age swept aside" but refuses (or is unable) to clarify what it means.

Since the formation of the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]], the academy has become more practical in focus.

The primary building dates to 5 AC, and is inhabited by the soul of [[Katheryn Archmagus]], who encoded her soul and had it incorporated as the genius loci on her death in 62 AC. She is not particularly fond of the HKR, but the wizards have put blocks in place so she can't do much about it. In revenge, she has sealed access to the old archives.

== Basic Layout ==
[[File:GraniteFlameAcademy.png|left|frameless|800x800px]]
The Academy proper is home to 5 departments, plus a library, while the college has 4 primary departments. These images show the ground-floor layout of the academy (left) and the neighboring bardic college (right). Other images show the upper floors of the academy only.

The departments are:

Energetics: The study of elements, matter, and energy in their purest forms. Also the home of most of the direct offensive magic. The most well-developed department in the HKR era.

Antithetics: The study of defensive and counter-magic. The shield to Energetics' sword. Also substantial.

Vocatetics: The study of summoning, controlling, and banishing extra-planar creatures. As well as a study of the planes themselves.

Auguretics: The study of oracles, farsight, and general information gathering and communication magics.

Substance studies: the smallest department, the two mages and three scholars here study the transformation of different objects (and creatures) into other ones.

The College's departments are

Rhetoric: the study of spoken and written communications, as well as the administrative center.

Historical Musicology: History of music, harmony...and general histories.

Systematic Musicology: Music as magic. As well as a study of the history of magic.

Ethnomusicology: The music of other cultures, including extra-planar ones. And not just music, this is the diplomatic section.

When that capital was destroyed by a [[concept bomb]] during the civil war that ended the empire, the Four Towers remained and were one of the foremost centers of learning and knowledge. In the last minutes of the [[Cataclysm War]], as the [[Cataclysm]]'s wave of disruption swept toward them, the sages and residents of the towers activated the defensive mechanisms that displaced the towers into [[Shadow]], hoping to transition back within hours once the wave passed. Or at least that was the intent. Instead, the towers were trapped in a demiplane without access to the outside. The inhabitants were divided as to how to manage. The Tower of the Sun, home to the arcane power-plant that supplied the facility, tried to burn their way out; instead they destroyed themselves and the inside of the tower. With this failure and the reduced power (and concomitant loss of food and water production), the [[Dark Lady]], the cleric and leader of the entire facility, gave into paranoia and despair. She pledged herself and the souls of those in the facility to the [[White Skull]] in exchange for the knowledge and power to escape that demiplane bubble. With her sister [[Kinlanna]] (who was the administrator of the Tower of the Stars) as co-conspirator, she killed the sages of the library tower by placing the tower in stasis (and overriding the safety mechanisms) and summoned demons to enact a horrific ritual. A demon of rage was summoned and imprisoned in a ritual circle, its ever-flowing power being used to bring the tower facility back to reality. The other residents of the Tower of the Moon were sacrificed to an eternal living death to keep the demon imprisoned and aware. The Tower of the Earth, fearing the insanity of the [[Dark Lady]], locked its doors and surrendered itself to Shadow in a bid for survival.

Time did not flow the same way inside the bubble as outside. Inside, only a few months passed, while outside nearly 200 years passed by. The towers resurfaced (along with the mountaintop on which they were built) in the middle of [[Lake Coy'in]], which had formed where it once stood. The [[Dark Lady]] and [[Kinlanna]] escaped, passing through the [[Portal Network]] node to [[Kel'al'ar]], where the dark lady took over the local government and Kinlanna married Phraya [[Hvang Ssa'ka]] to act as an intermediary. The towers stood mostly empty, surrounded by a divine barrier placed to keep the demonic corruption within from spreading outward.

Several years later, the [[Catalysts]] entered the barrier and liberated the facility, destroying the demon and ending the stasis effect (at the cost of the mind of the Tower of Stars), all with the help and sacrifice of the remaining residents of the Tower of the Earth.

Since then, the Towers have become a major hub of science and learning. The [[Sages]] are headquartered there, and the [[gwerin]] residents of the [[Crisial Kingdom]] have made it their capital. The Tower of the Sun has been rebuilt, and efforts are underway to extract as much information out of the immense library inside the Tower of the Stars.

The south-western portion of the area is mostly an extension of the Sea of Grass, while the north-eastern portion is dominated by the [[Dreamwall Mountains]], a new ([[Cataclysm]]-era) mountain range that stopped the inrushing [[Sea of Dreams]] from washing over the entire area.

==Map==
[[File:dreamshore10mi.png|frameless|800px|Dreamshore ca 250 AC]]

==Nations==
Dreamshore is almost entirely occupied by the [[Duarchy of Kotimaa]].

===Major Cities===
* [[Baile Craan]] is the regional capital of Dreamshore.
* [[Rabbiton]] is a trade and fishing city on the shores of [[Lake Coy'in]]
* [[Innsmouth]] is the gateway to the [[Pactum Grove]]

===Towns===
* [[Sheplyn]] is situated at the intersection of the [[Avon-Pact]] river and the Rabbit Road that connects the two parts of the Duarchy. As such, it's becoming a burgeoning trade town.

===Villages===
* [[Cragdale]] A large logging village on the edge of the [[Dreamwall Mountains]], Cragdale dreams of being more. Home of Lord Sumpter.

== Climate ==
Humid and wet most of the year. The Dreamwall gets substantial wet snow but rarely gets extremely cold due to being sandwitched between bodies of water. High winds and storms are common, especially during the summer. The mountains are heavily forested, falling down to almost tree-less plains.

      <text bytes="2621" sha1="74irs89n2yxeocheyfckfpchurm4qqx" xml:space="preserve">Built in the [[Valley of Memory]] under [[Isskap]]'s reign as her palace and headquarters, Kek is a rambling palace, research facility, and (now) ruin. 

==Outer Defenses==
Built into the side of a mountain, Kek's primary defenses are the outer ring of forts and walls, stretching nearly 10 miles in radius. These massive walls are dominated by four major forts. Since the fall of [[Isskap]], the forts have been occupied only intermittently and have mostly fallen to ruin.

==Outer Palace==
The outer palace consists of a main courtyard with a gate and two wings that extend into the mountain on either side. The left wing was the barracks/servant wing. Here the legions of [[jazuu]] that served her directly at Kek were quartered. The right wing was the reception wing, filled with sybaritic spa's for guests, conference rooms, guest rooms, etc.

Access to the main core of the palace was either though the central courtyard or through either wing.

==Inner Core==
The inner core was the largest portion. All traffic had to go through the Main Hall, where Isskap held court amid statues of her defeated foes. Other notable places were the kennels and the research wing (including the place where Isskap was finally defeated). No one is quite sure how large this palace was at its height.

==Fall and Current State==
Kek started in decline toward the end of 211 AC, with the fall of the [[Hungering Frost]] and Isskap's retreat into darkness. She converted all the residents into either crystalline zombies or fuel for her soul-binding research (to create [[Ymir]]) and retreated into her lab, leaving her main lieutenants on the outer defenses to handle matters without her aid.

The [[Wild Cards]] arrived in 212 AC, with a force of angels, rebellious dwellers in [[Estokh]], and aid from [[Fenrir]] and her forces (along with purchased aid from the barbegazi lieutenant). While the forces held the line against the loyalist forces, the [[Wild Cards]] slipped inside. They freed the remaining children of [[Fenrir]] from the kennels and, after a hard-fought battle, defeated and destroyed [[Isskap]], [[Ymir]], and the incarnation of [[Broken Order]] that she was using as a power source. They then left.

The angels cleared out the worst of the corruption, but the area remains ill-omened and is considered to be cursed. Several would-be rulers have stepped up to claim the Ice Throne, but none have lasted--they've fallen to accidents, betrayals, or (mostly) strange occurrences that have driven people mad. Few go to Kek these days.

[[File:Lupausplain.png|frameless|800px|Lupaus Plains]]

==Climate==
The Lupaus Plains have a continental climate, with the east (near the lake) being the warmer and wetter areas. Summers are hot and dry, winters are cold with significant snow. Strong winds blow year-round. The land slopes downward toward the lake, but only gently. Very few trees grow on the plain, mostly in stream-beds and other sheltered areas.

==Nations==
Most of the plain is claimed by the [[Crisial Kingdom]]. This is contested to the west by [[Wyrmhold]] and to the south by the [[Windwalker Confederacy]], but only at the borders.

==Cities==
The only notable permanent settlements on the Lupaus Plain are at [[Vaeltaa]] (in the central plains) and at [[Ineg'and]] near the border with [[Southshore]].

The [[Horse Clans]] maintain a winter settlement at [[Pyhin]] and consider [[Talvi]] to be sacred. Neither of those locations are open to outsiders. In fact, non-[[Horse Clans|Horse Clan]] people are not welcome within several days travel of those areas.

More recently, intervention by the [[Southern Heroes]] freed North Ithemba from falling into the [[Abyss]] and have revitalized the area.

It was built to guard the northern exit of the only tunnel through the [[Riftwall Mountains]] and the only land connection between the two halves of the continent. From here, the "failed" creations of the [[Phoenix Empire]]'s bio-engineers were cast out into the [[Great Rift]] and the door was held against their return to the [[Solar Highlands]] to the south.

Contains the only accessible (to [[Noefra]]ns) node of the [[Portal Network]] in [[Soefra]]. The whole area is under the direct control of the [[Adventurer's Guild]] by special dispensation of the South Ithemban government.

The [[Riftwall Mountains]] separate it from the [[Solar Highlands]] and the rest of the continent to the south, while the [[Broken Range]] wards off the [[Primal Sea]] to the north. Both of these stand nearly 15000 ft (on average) above the rift floor. Small bits of land are found to the north of the [[Broken Range]], and cave complexes span both sets of mountains.

==Map==
[[File:greatrift.png|frameless|800px|The Great Rift]]

==Climate==
Most of the rift is equatorial/tropical jungle. The highlands of [[Ithemba]] are dryer (being shielded from the rains by the mountains to east and west), and the far eastern area is mostly desert.

==Nations==
; Dusk : This southern Soefran nation has colonized the south-western area of the rift. While it claims much land, it has not settled it (mainly working with and extorting resources out of the local tribes).
; Two Moons : This southern Soefran nation has settled the arid region to the south-east of the rift. Unlike Dusk, it has heavily settled that region.
; [[Ithemba]] : Located in the central highlands of the rift (merely 10,000 ft below the peaks), the nations of Ithemba have made contact with [[Noefra]].
; Hardshell : A small nation dominated by [[khol-ka]] (or turtle folk), located in the north-central region. Slow and deliberate, they are a beacon of civilization in the savage areas of the rift.
; [[Ship People]] : These [[sena'ka]] slavers and pirates have a small foothold on the continent to the north of the [[Broken Range]]. Most of their holdings are on the islands in the [[Primal Sea]].
; Ikela : This nation of humans is in constant struggles over the Bay of Ikela with the [[Ship People]].

Most of the area is tribal, dominated by [[zandolit]] tribes (among others).

With an average height well above 15,000 ft and multiple peaks over 25,000 ft, it is a daunting barrier despite its relative thinness in parts. It ranges from only 40 miles thick (near [[Exile's Watch]]) to almost 300 miles thick. On the northern face, it is almost entirely sheer, with single unbroken faces of 5000 to 6000 feet being the norm. The southern side is more gradual, but still very sheer.

Despite this sheerness and inhospitability, the inside of the range is honeycombed with tunnels, caverns, and other inhabited spaces.

==Map showing tunnel network==
[[File:underMountain.png|frameless|800px|Tunnel Network]]

==Cultures Undermountain==
Three main cultures exist under the Riftwall. They are the Anzai, the Asegai, and the Consumed.
; The [[Anzai]]: not all [[goroesi]] were in the area around the [[Kel'tan]] capital when the Third Moon fell. Those that lived to the south and survived the separation of [[Soefra]] from [[Noefra]] chose not to work with the [[Phoenix Empire]] and instead claimed the inside of the Riftwall as their own. The Anzai are a proud, matriarchal culture known for worshiping the [[Dancer in the Dark]] as well as a spider-like devil named [[Sek'hoa]]. They have limited interactions with one small town in South [[Ithemba]], as well as guarded relationships with [[Two Moons]].
; The [[Asegai]]: those dwarves who ended up in [[Soefra]] were few in number, and of a particularly traditional and xenophobic orientation. They are the Asegai. They have taken most of the western portion of the Riftwall, and are rivals to (and frequently at war with) the Anzai. They are being significantly impacted by the rise of the [[Consumed]], who started in the westernmost cities and have progressively moved eastward.
; The [[Consumed]]: The Consumed started out as an asegai subculture. Oppressed and disaffected, they gave themselves to a [[comiedai]], who through his [[mkhulu]] agents has dominated those cities ever since. They are progressively expanding, using their strange mind powers (gained from the [[comiedai]]) to infiltrate and take over other asegai settlements. The asegai have blocked the only connection between the [[Consumed]] and the rest of the asegai, but tunneling efforts are underway.

They were originally created by [[Leviathan]] to act as mobile memory stores for information brought back by the [[mkhulu]] from explorations on land. But the [[Twisted]] (who was instrumental in encouraging their creation) had other plans. He altered most of them to desire domination for the purpose of "improving" the land-based mortals. Ever since, most comiedai have sought to make deals with land-dwellers in distress, promising them power (or usually vengeance) in exchange for service. They give power by converting them into [[mkhulu]]. By and large, they uphold their deals, but always in a way that creates expanding nests of mkhulu and their thralls. This they do to "order" the chaotic lives of mortals, breaking them into shape according to the philosophies of the particular comiedar.

The titans and wyrm fell in their wars, the lightborn and proteans have significantly changed, but Leviathan remains. And remembers.

Leviathan is a single entity distributed over millions of bodies. Essentially every large (and many small) deep sea beast is part of this networked mind. Although cells come and go, the essence of Leviathan remains intact. Leviathan's primary purpose, it believes, is to remember everything. Everything that happens in the sea, everything that happens on land, everything. This it does by singing the information back and forth to itself.

Communication with Leviathan is difficult, as its mode of speech and even its thought patterns are alien. This alien character is in speed (Leviathan does nothing fast), outlook on sequence (Leviathan keeps all things as present, so historical sequencing is difficult), and outlook on individual mortality (Leviathan does not die, and scarcely understands what that even means). Those sages who have altered themselves into suitable hosts to join the Eternal Song have come back insane...if they've come back at all.

      <text bytes="2216" sha1="99obq9yxbsg1x2o1ukqe6ifmxj15ssl" xml:space="preserve">When the Army of Chaos besieged the grand dwarven city of [[Hammerhead]], capital of the [[Iron Dominions]] as their second target during the [[Cataclysm War]], the city held out for quite a while. Eventually, however, they were overwhelmed and the survivors were forced to retreat to the central fortified core, there to await destruction. They were spared, however, by the [[Cataclysm]], which broke the armies and sent them fleeing in every direction. The survivors of Hammerhead, however, had other problems. With too few people left to grow food, and all contact (and magic) cut off with the rest of the world, they retreated underground (a very dwarven thing to do) and sought for aid from the ruler of the [[Plane of Lava]], [[Alastor, World Judge|Alastor, named World Judge]]. This plea was granted, at a cost. All the children were brought before his fiery emissaries. Those considered worthy were transformed into the [[vulkite]]s, beings of elemental fire in the shape of a dwarf, free of mortal concerns such as compassion or remorse. In exchange for this sacrifice, the newly-born civilization gained access to potent fire-magics and secrets that let them survive the dark years.

For the next 100 years, they mostly dug downward. The surface was a hostile place in their minds, fit only for the lower classes and automatons to grow food on. The advent of the [[Hungering Frost]] started a second phase, when the Khaimal (for that is the name they took) started to fortify the core and build manufacturing facilities there, building incomprehensible machinery. Those that did not fit their rigidly ordered society were cast out or enslaved (often by having their souls placed in the control crystals of the automatons on which the Khaimal relied). By 211 AC, the entire city core had been transformed into a single building and a great spire had been built to redirect the sunlight (to counter the effect of the Frost), creating interior greenhouses. An outer area was created as a dead zone--anyone who entered a 1/2 mile exclusion zone without a Khaimal escort was set upon by artillery and destroyed.

      <text bytes="3846" sha1="pcsmfq5xxbyxrshzpfw68szmj82d2pp" xml:space="preserve">Isal Dao, one of the candidates for Phraya of the Southern District of the [[Stone Throne]], was not a patient man. Nor was he one who was likely to succeed on his own merits. Unpopular with the commoners, seen as slimy and unreliable by the lai, and thought of as a pervy joke by the other isal, he basically had no chance. Until he was recruited by the [[Red Lantern Society]]. By joining with that devil cult (pledged to [[Gethry'al'Abyoza]], lieutenant of Family Abyoza), he gained access to the devil's influence and (more importantly) money. He started a line of brothels, recruiting only the most beautiful men and women. He augmented their numbers (and their seductive grace) with succubi pledged to Abyoza, although he had them tame their life-draining powers. Instead, they worked their charm, gathering blackmail on the movers and shakers of the district. For a while, things were looking good for a straight-forward political campaign. His new master, however, had other plans. He planned to breed himself a foothold, much like other families had done in the [[Jinse Empire]] far to the east. He began (with willing subjects at first) impregnating women by his fiendish subordinates, as well as using women possessed by succubi to gather seed from target males. When there weren't enough willing victims, he turned to kidnapping the "unwanted" (in the name of "clearing the streets of the undesirable") and shipping them to camps to be used as breeding pools.

But then the [[Ship People]] arrived, and Dao (and Gethry) saw an opportunity to accelerate the process. Dao, through his Red Lantern allies, reached out and struck a deal. The [[sena'ka]] would raid to the east, into his rival Isal Dara's territory, while he accelerated his plans and lent covert support. Things were going well. Then the pesky adventurers of the [[Dimwit Syndicate]] arrived. They stopped a major push by the [[sena'ka]] and devil allies, and alerted the army to his involvement. Once his hand had been tipped, he began mustering for outright rebellion.

At first, he mainly used his outlaw and mercenary hirelings to stage false-flag attacks on bordering villages to get the people to flee to his territory for safety. Those that arrived were processed into the breedable, and the expendable. The expendable were brainwashed, given weapons, and sent to the front lines as canon fodder. The breedable were sent to the camps. As things escalated and the [[Stone Throne]] army arrived in late 211 AC, the situation reached a stalemate. Dao didn't have enough strength to actually make progress, but the army was distracted by dealing with the [[Ship People]], who had landed in force. While several battles took place near the southernmost tip of [[Lake Thom]], and other naval battles took place on the lake itself, the battle lines didn't move for nearly two years. Infiltration was blocked by Gethry's servants, who had maintained a watching eye over the entire rebel nation. It wasn't until a strike force of [[Handmaiden]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and adventurers, aided by the devil [[Iago'vel'abyoza]] (who had become involved with the [[Dimwit Syndicate]] earlier) slipped through the lines and assassinated the key cambions commanding the Red Lantern. With them gone, the infernals were banished to their Astral realm, and Dao's forces collapsed. Dao, who had become almost entirely a figurehead by this point, a mouthpiece for Gethry, tried to flee but was caught by his "concubines" (really slaves he kept for sexual purposes) and was beaten to death. Thus ended the Devil's Rebellion.

One main side effect of this is that the area (now belonging to the [[Serpent Dominion]]) is known for the abnormally-high numbers of devil-touched births (nearly 1 in 6 births show markings, and the trend is stable two generations later).

At the [[Cataclysm]], when the Left [[Eyes of Qa'desh|Eye of Qa'desh]] was ordered to destroy itself, it sucked in a large fraction of the ambient anima in the eastern hemisphere, and then backfired. It fed that anima, now tainted by strong abyssal influence due to the presence of the [[Nameless]], back into the channels leading to the elemental planes. This abrupt backflow broke the careful meshing of the planes, and things started falling apart. The destruction reverberated through the Mortal plane, causing widespread devastation and natural disasters, including volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, subsidence and upwellings of land, gigantic storms, tsunamis, etc.

To prevent the utter destruction of the universe, the [[Great Mechanism]] reversed the normal flow of anima to the gods, absorbing most of them and completely depowering the remainder. It used those reserves to break the elemental planes into smaller chunks. Setting these chunks, the current planes, against each other provided some measure of stability. However, any spell that interacted with the elemental or astral planes was thus invalidated. Combined with the death of the gods and the drastic reduction in anima, magic in general ceased operation for nearly 50 years in [[Noefra]] and 10-30 years on the other continents.

Over the next 50 years, the [[Great Mechanism]] apotheosized new gods, and normalcy returned to the world.

By which they mean purging any "unclean" element (ie devils, demons, orcs, goblins...basically anything but humans, halflings, elves, and dwarves, and they're not so fond of elves and dwarves) from the world. This has not won them any popularity contests with the greater populace.

Really, while they claim to be empowered by [[Peor-fala]] (and they do wield divine power), some god-watchers believe that really [[Pinwheel]] or [[Roel Kor]] is behind the whole faction. Why? Just for laughs, and to poke [[Peor-fala]], who can be a bit preachy at times.

They're headquartered in the [[True Hold]], a small fortress village on the [[Sea of Dreams]] east of [[Godsfall]]. Since they were established in 202 AC, they've split into a hard-core faction (headquartered there) and a much larger, more moderate faction that has learned to work better with others and is part of the [[Duarchy of Kotimaa]], headquartered in [[Elysium]] in [[Godsfall]].

The Twisted was once one of the children of the Mother of Monsters, [[Echidra]]. After the [[Dawn War]], it claimed to have been coerced and repentant, and identified his mother and siblings as threats to the natural order. This led to their imprisonment in [[Aenimos]]. Created with a water aspect, it takes the shape of a gigantic (and distorted) kraken with a humanoid face and mouths instead of suckers.

It quickly embraced devouring souls, and was one of the first Demon Princes. It was responsible for the corruption of the [[mkhulu]] and [[comiedai]] after their creation by [[Leviathan]] and thus the ur source of a major threat to mortals everywhere.

One of its more recent projects was the Twisted Lands, now known as the [[Blood-thirst Wildlands]]. One of its major mortal servants, a [[mkhulu]] brain pod, had made a nest in an abandoned temple near the epicenter of the [[Cataclysm]] and its servants had been actively corrupting and twisting the landscape around it. That plot was disrupted by the [[Catalysts]] in 205 AC, who first dropped a significant meteor on it (an echo of [[Moon's Fall]] many centuries before) and then stormed in and slew the brain pod.

Located on the southern tip of [[Lake Coy'in]], it's one of the newest cities in the [[Federated Nations]]. Founded by the [[Council Lands]] in 199 AC under the name Yuuras Zaali, it was the site of the [[Catalysts]]' first exploits, and is the closest city to the [[Towers of Sun, Earth, Moon, and Stars]] and the [[Lady's Grove]]. It is also situated directly on the main (and only) trade routes from the western nations to the east (and back). As a result of those location advantages, it began to expand rapidly by about 214 AC. A major exodus of the High Houses of the [[gwerin]] from [[Kaelthia]] to Crisial City occurred shortly before the [[Crystal Spire War]] (and in fact were a major factor behind that short-lived conflict). As the [[Council Lands]] became moribund and began to disintegrate, the citizens of Yuuras Zaali decided to take matters into their own hands. By 220 AC, they had begun to construct a new wall of stone and expand the docks both outside and inside the wall; the wall was mostly finished (at least the eastern portion) by the start of the civil war in 227, and played a role in the defense of the city against forces from other regions. It was completely finished in 237 AC, although finishing touches (including a facade of marble) are still being added slowly.

===Sections and Color Codes===
* Areas marked in yellow (bright or faded) are predominantly [[gwerin]]-occupied.
** The Unhoused (outside the wall to the west, near the [[Lady's Grove]]) is the [[gwerin]] "slum" where [[gwerin]] commoners and those without House affiliations live. This area has mostly long, low apartment buildings with communal kitchen areas and other facilities surrounding courtyards with wells. There are also many shops here, selling diverse wares.
** The Low House District is populated by people associated with the Low Houses, many of whom serve or work for the High Houses. This area has lots of large houses subdivided into apartments. There are also commercial buildings here, mainly catering to the upper class gwerin.
** The High House District is, despite its large size, thinly populated Each block is an estate containing multiple houses and towers belonging to one of the high houses. As a general rule, those closer to the river and closer south are higher status.
** The Palace is the estate where Queen Raanee lives. Not a formal palace, nor is it heavily defensible except by opening the bridges that connect the two sides of the river. It's mostly just a well-built estate. The actual seat of government is on the smaller island to the north.
* Areas marked in green (dark or light) have mostly [[wall-builder]] occupants.
** The Outwall is the "human slum", but actually has the largest [[halfling]] population. Much more ramshackle and impermanent than the Unhoused, these tend to be wooden houses and shacks crammed close together. Shops here tend to be heavily guarded and/or shady.
** The Ring Road District (just inside the wall on the western side) is the oldest portion of town, with a few buildings dating back to the founding. It used to be high-class, but has degenerated significantly. Now it's lower-class, where the unpopular artisans and other skilled workers live and work.
** The River District is the home of the wealthier merchants and artisans. Many of these aspire to nobility and/or ape the fashions of the [[gwerin]] across the river (a fact which the gwerin studiously ignore). Larger houses and higher-class establishments are located here.
** The Feather District is home to the human noblility (at least their city homes). Large, fortified estates and a few very-high-end shops, taverns, and clubs fill this area.
* Areas in brown are trade, mercantile, or warehouse districts.
** The Foreign Merchants district is home to most of the companies that trade between nations. Major shipping concerns have their headquarters (or branch headquarters) in this area. It is also where the foreign ambassadors live and have their embassies.
** The Inner Docks are a small set of docks inside the wall. Most of the bulk cargo is offloaded in the Outer Docks, but couriers, pleasure boats, passenger vessels, and other such boats dock here.
** The Trade District is where much of the larger business establishments are located. This also includes the main city markets (although each district has its own smaller markets).
** The Outer Docks District is where the large ships dock and where most of the warehouses are. Especially for those transshipping with the western nations along the Dragon Road.
** The Grain Merchants District, contrary to its name, doesn't have many grain silos (although some remain). Instead, it's where much of the industry happens. Factories (especially those needing water), tanneries, etc. It's also where fishing boats dock.
* The Dwarven District, the smallest of the districts, is home to many of the dwarven-run companies, forges, etc. It is also the main storage location for minerals and stone coming from the mines and quarries upstream. One of the major docks for traffic down the river is located upstream of the Dwarven District outside of the wall.

      <text bytes="3384" sha1="nsxymrpcaekq71qn2qhoswrmitql7np" xml:space="preserve">The most ancient continuously-inhabited city in the eastern portion of the [[Federated Nations]], Fuar Uulan was the ancestral clan-hold of the Uulan clan before the [[Cataclysm]] (and for centuries before that). The Fuar clan joined them soon before the [[Cataclysm]], making the city Fuar Uulan. In the wake of the [[Cataclysm]], when the surviving dwarven clans (led by clan Alkh) made their way south, they were taken in by their relatives, and the city grew tremendously (and many daughter clan-holds were formed in those mountains). Fuar Uulan joined the newly-formed [[Council Lands]] as the second city after [[Kaelthia]].

Fuar Uulan remained the traditional and religious center of dwarven life in the [[Council Lands]] until the end of the Council in 227 AC, although much of the commercial life moved to [[Kaelthia]] to escape the stifling traditionalism of the underground city. A good chunk of the disaffected, non-traditional dwarves went north to [[Shinevog]] in the last decade or so of the Council as well. With the civil war that erupted after the [[Guildmasters]] plot, Fuar Uulan and the rest of the dwarven community in the [[Outer Barrier Range]] pulled in their horns, ejected most of the non-dwarven populace, and shut their gates (as dwarves are so wont to do when troubles arise outside). They remained mostly untouched by the civil war, although a few clans broke away and joined different sides.

In the [[Treaty of Rauviz]] that ended the war, Fuar Uulan was made the capital of the [[Uulan Confederacy]], a position it has retained in the 20 years since that event. Compared to most of the capital cities, it is somewhat sleepy and small--non-dwarves are allowed inside but are generally not made welcome.

==Map==
[[File:fuaruulan.png|frameless|800px|Fuar Uulan ca 250 AC]]

==Districts==
Fuar Uulan resides entirely within Mount Uul, one of the larger peaks in the [[Outer Barrier Range]]. Areas in grey are primary tunnels, smaller tunnels are not marked. Dashed lines separate districts.
* Residential Districts 
** Dirt Quarter. A medium-low status residential district.
** River Quarter. A low-status residential district.
** Outsider District. The only place that outsiders (non-dwarves) are allowed to reside except by special permission. Buildings here are larger with higher ceilings. Very low status.
** Grass District. Medium status.
** Stone District. Medium Status
** Old Uulan District. High status.
** Far-traveler District. Home to inns for those traveling the Under-road.
** Listener District. Very high status.
** Mythril District. Very high status.
* Commercial Districts
** Flower Quarter. Low-status commercial district, mainly dealing with goods from outside.
** Copper Quarter. Basic metal and stonework. Medium-low status. Open to outsiders.
** Jewel District. Fine work. Open to outsiders.
** Iron District. High status work.
** Silver District. High status work.
** Old Fuar Quarter.
** Gold Quarter. Trade with other dwarven clans. Generally off-limits to outsiders.
* Religious or political districts
** Silent Temple. Religious district.
** Listener District. Home to many of the priests and clergy. Off-limits to outsiders.
** Circle of Exemplars. Government district.
** Archivist Quarter. Home to the archives and archivists. Very very high status. Off-limits to outsiders.

Since they departed for parts unknown about 550 years ago, the city has remained under the control of first the [[Stone Throne]] and then the [[Serpent Dominion]]. It was the center of the retreat of the [[Stone Throne]] at the [[Cataclysm]]; it is currently the capital of the [[Serpent Dominion]].

Visually, the city is dominated by a crescent-moon cliff of limestone rising about 200 feet above the lower city; on that upper hill area is the noble district. A gigantic building in the shape of a serpent's fanged head, jaws open, juts from the cliff in the center; a waterfall cascades from its open mouth, pooling below.

==Map==
[[File:kelalarcity.png|frameless|800px|Kel'al'ar City]]

==Districts==
There are 6 major districts, each of which has a northern (Cheung') and southern (Baung') division. The division line is the Coiled Canal, an artificial branch of the local U'psa river which passes to the north of the city. Despite its varying width and depth, the channel is fixed by enchanted stone barriers and it never exceeds its bounds and remains clean all year round.
* Isal: the isal districts are restricted to nobles. These are mainly large gated complexes, but some smaller estates dot the landscape. The Cheung' side is the more prestigious side, and closer to the river is higher status. The Upper Wall encircles this district.
* Sur'lai: The district of Esteemed Tradesmen, this is where the wealthy and high-status merchants and crafters live and do business. Here the buildings are close-packed, but often enclose interior courtyards and gardens. Slate roofs and half-stone construction are most common. This district spills up the side hills and even extends slightly inside the Upper Wall.
* Ba'lai: The district of Low Tradesmen. This is where those who cater to commoners and foreigners dwell and do business. These buildings, like those in sur'lai, are close-packed and half-stone with slate roofs, but generally share courtyards and gardens.
* Teab: the district of Trusted Commoners. These are the servants and workers for the tradesmen and those who support the nobles. Most of the foreign influence is also located here, away from the delicate sensibilities of the nobles.
* Saam: the district of Trash, or the Untrusted. This is a slum, where those laborers and others not trusted inside the city wall dwell. It is also the site of most of the manufacturing and other heavy crafting for the city. Here are found the giant looms, the warehouses, and the smelteries and great hammer forges.
* Klenosaoy: The Stinks. Along the bottom of the canal are those industries that are too odoriferous and unpleasant to be kept inside the city or even in the saam districts.

      <text bytes="4962" sha1="q1szdhoz8mwdok0jql213x655tr3pmb" xml:space="preserve">Unlike most other signatory nations to the [[Federated Nations]] compact, the Windwalker Confederacy isn't really a nation at all. Instead, it's a collective name for the entire collection of goblinoid tribes living north of the [[Blood-thirst Wildlands]] and outside the zones of control of the of the other nations. The vast majority of these tribes have little or no contact with outsiders. Instead, the Windwalker tribe acts as a proxy and guarantees safe passage of merchant caravans and other travellers throughout the territory as long as those travellers obey certain regulations (see below). Independent "off-road" expeditions are not guaranteed, and any such expeditions are at the risk of those participating. 

No current census or enumeration of tribes exists, and it's unlikely that any such would be permitted. The few reports that have reached the other nations indicate that the density of inhabitants in the area is quite low and that each tribe has a significant amount of space to wander around in. Most of the tribes are pastoral herders or hunter-gatherers.

==Traveler Regulations==
The Windwalker tribe (centered at [[Fort Hope]]) has made deals with the tribes that claim territory along the trade routes. These deals allow for safe (from the goblinoids anyway) passage for caravans and travellers under the following conditions.
# All travelers must obtain a trade banner from a Windwalker representative. This banner must be visible at all times during the travels. Failure to show the banner negates any protections. Each banner is unique and the patterns are only known to the Windwalker tribe (and their contracting parties among the local tribes).
# Travelers must group themselves into caravans matching one of the following sizes and pay a toll corresponding to the size.
## Small caravans: Up to 10 people, with no more than 4 draft or pack animals. One wagon or cart. Toll: 2 gp per person, plus 1 gp per animal. Must maintain a distance of 10 miles from the nearest caravan. Lowest priority on use of watering holes or rest stations, and must pay full price at those establishments. No limit on number per route per season, must provide own guides and guards.
## Medium caravans: Up to 50 people, with no more than 10 wagons. No limit on pack animals. 20 gp per wagon plus 1 gp per person. Priority use of watering holes. Flat-fee rates for rest station use. Can hire guides at flat rate of 20 gp, but must provide own guards. Limited to 10 per route per season (5 in each direction).
##Large caravans: Up to 100 people or 20 wagons. 50 gp per wagon or four pack animals. Priority use of watering holes and rest stations. Integrated guide and guard complement. Nominal fees for rest station use. Limited to 2 per route per season, one in each direction (6 per route per year). Restricted to registered trading companies. Individuals must purchase passage from one of these companies.
# Travelers must follow designated routes. Departure from these routes invalidates protections.
# Travelers in medium or large caravans must camp only at designated spots along the routes. Small caravans can camp wherever as long as they're within 100 yards of the trail at all times and follow standard precautions for fire safety and disposal of waste.
# Foraging off-road is strictly prohibited.
# Travelers wishing to engage in trade with local tribes must purchase an additional sub-banner and display it in their camps when they wish to trade. Trade must be done in barter only (local tribes will not accept coin) and is strictly at the traveler's risk. ''Caveat Emptor''.

==Traveler Cautions==
# While watering holes are available along the routes, they are not common. Travelers (especially on lesser-traveled routes) should plan on bringing their own supplies.
# Repair facilities and inns are generally not available. Some rest stations might have blacksmiths or wagon-repair specialists, but don't count on it.
# While a trade banner does provide a measure of safety from the local goblinoid tribes (backed by Windwalker military force), it cannot protect against any of the following conditions, so private guards are strongly advised unless traveling with a large caravan.
## Raiding parties from wild tribes who are not part of the Confederacy. This is most common along the southernmost stretches of the routes. Complaints are allowed (from survivors) and Windwalker patrols try to keep the area safe, but can't be everywhere.
## Wild beasts or savage species such as (but not limited to) giant-kin, wolves, land-sharks, harpies, and burrow-worms.
## Weather events (including dust storms or flash floods)
## Re-appearance of pre-Cataclysm ruins, structures, places, or other such occurrences. Travelers who witness such phenomena are encouraged to report it to the Windwalker representative at their next rest area and may be rewarded for accurate and detailed reports.

      <text bytes="4638" sha1="sscpg5oxg9qz30osnmnlktif7bi3xwy" xml:space="preserve">The south-central region of western [[Noefra]], south of the [[Windwalker Confederacy]] and bordering [[Byssia]] to the west and the [[Jungle of Fangs]] to the east, the Blood-thirst Wildlands are not claimed by any single nation and are considered hostile terrain. Home to a wide variety of races, tribes, and strange beasts, the wildlands are a dangerous place about which very little is known.

==History==
Not much is known about this area. It seems to have been substantially different during the Old Western Empire--surviving maps and records from before the [[War of Souls]] show a completely different landscape. Whether that landscape was destroyed during that war, cut off from reality, or simply altered into the current territory is unknown. What is known is that the incidence rate of re-appearance of Imperial-era ruins, structures (some still operational) and other such phenomena is much higher as you move further south than in more settled lands.

During the reconstruction era (from the end of the [[War of Souls]] until the [[Cataclysm]]), this region was considered uninhabited and unknown. Covered in thick jungle, it held a dangerous allure for adventurers and explorers and claimed many lives. What is known is that there once was a large temple to an unknown goddess located near the center of the wildlands. This temple was the home of the [[Eyes of Qa'desh|Left Eye of Qa'desh]] for many centuries, until the [[Divine Three]] retrieved it just hours before the [[Cataclysm]]. That event drained the anima out of much of the continent and the effect was worse near the epicenter of the blast. All life within 50-60 miles of the temple withered and crumbled to dust and much of the rock crumbled to colorless sand. According to the [[Catalysts]], even 200 years later there was still a ~10 mile band of blasted lands (although the temple itself still remained intact somehow).

Life returned to the wildlands slowly. About 60 years ago (roughly 190 AC), the [[Demon Princes|demon prince]] known as the [[Twisted]] sent a major [[mkhulu]] agent into the heart of the wildlands. It established a lair in the ruins of the temple and began a slow ritual that corrupted life starting from that point. As it gathered allies and power, it sent out parties to conduct twisted rituals at the edges of the tainted area to accelerate the process. The inhabitants (mostly goblinoids) fled as best they could northward away from the corruption, but many were left behind. Those that escaped are now part of the [[Windwalker Confederacy]]; those that remained were twisted by the fell magics. As the corrupted area grew, the druids of [[Byssia]] began fighting back, but were fighting a losing battle.

In 205 AC, the [[Catalysts]], drawn by rumors of growing corruption, found one of the ritual sites. They then sought out the [[Byssia]n druids and received from them a ritual weapon of great power, capable of conjuring large chunks of stone to bombard the enemy from a great distance. With the help of avatars of [[Yogg-Maggus]], [[Pinwheel]], and the [[Hollow King]], they completed the ritual (fighting off a partial appearance of the [[Twisted]] in the process). Hastening south, they defeated the [[Twisted]'s agents and stopped the encroaching corruption. Since then, the area has been mostly left wild. Pockets of corruption still remain, but most of it has been cleansed by Quartus itself (as with most abyssal influence in the absence of active demonic presence).

Recently, the [[Serpent Dominion]] and [[Asai'ka]] have begun expanding into the eastern portions of the wildlands on the shore of the [[Serpent Sea]]. So far, they've not gotten past the borders very far.

==Major Inhabitants==
The northern region (nearer to [[Fort Hope]]) is known to be inhabited by goblinoid tribes, some of which still bear significant abyssal taint. These should be considered unfriendly at best and treated with extreme caution.

There are reports of fish-people along the southern edge near the [[Primal Sea]], and explorers from the [[Serpent Dominion]] have encountered other aquatic and amphibian species. Unconfirmed reports of rampant fey and therianthrope bands have also been made.

The most well-known danger are the pockets of abyssal taint and the twisted wildlife that they cause. Wildlife exhibiting strange mutations or behaviors should be destroyed ASAP, lest it taint other creatures. The [[Sages]] have put a small bounty on substantial and confirmed reports on such wildlife.

;Nation: [[Windwalker Confederacy]]

Fort Hope is both the center of the [[Federated Nations]] (housing the [[Palace of Nations]] which serves as the headquarters and meeting area) and the home base of the [[Windwalker Legion]]. Since its founding in 206 AC (and the destruction of the undead occupying the fort itself), it has grown significantly and now serves as the only major city in the [[Windwalker Confederacy]] and a trading hub, as well as the home of the [[Adventurer's Academy]] and the [[Adventurer's Guild]].

==Map==
[[File:fort_hope.png|frameless|800px|Fort Hope]]

===Districts===
* [[Palace of Nations]]. Once a pre-Cataclysm fort, now home to the [[Federated Nations]] establishment.
* The Academy. The large building is the Academy proper, but teachers and students live behind it. Adventurer's Guild members have subsidized housing in this district.
* Embassy Row. Contains the embassies and support personnel for the various delegations to the FNC.
* Trade Town. Shops, merchants, warehouses. Fort Hope is a major trans-shipment point, especially with the [[Portal Network]] node here (in the plaza).
* Windwalker Barracks. Home to the legion. Mostly barracks-style housing and support facilities (including armor repair, etc), although the administrative facilities are also here.

==Locations==
* Catalyst's Blessing. An [[Adventurer's Guild]] run hostelry on the edge of the central square for travelling adventurers on guild business. Well kept, goblin run. Familiar with breakage, loud noises, and other such things.
* Adventurer's Guild Training facilities. Technically part of the Academy, but open to registered adventurers for training needs. State of the art, including medical services. Located in Academy behind the main academy.
*Blerp. A somewhat seedy inn outside the north-west wall. Run by a goblin tribe as a collective. They're all identical and named Blerp.

As part of the deals that allow free access and trade throughout the [[Windwalker Confederacy]], each tribe sends one or more of its hobgoblins to [[Fort Hope]] to join the Legion.

The Legion (currently numbering about 2300 individuals) is responsible for maintaining the peace in the WC and patrolling the roads. They do very little else, although some of them serve as instructors or adjuncts at the [[Adventurer's Academy]].

Its capital was [[Hammerhead]].

The Iron Dominions were destroyed by the Army of Chaos during the [[Cataclysm War]]. A few survivors formed the [[Khaimal]] nation. Since the fall of the [[Hungering Frost]], they've concentrated on rebuilding and fortifying the ruins of [[Hammerhead]].

Angered by the mistreatment of the budding [[Puun Ihmisia|puun ihmisia]] by their arcane-wielding [[aelvar]] overlords, the first Circle of druids gathered together and hatched a monstrous plan (under [[Awakener]] influence). Through rituals of voluntary sacrifice, they made a bond with the kami of the third moon, Tatzii. Over months, they drew this rock (approximately 5 miles in diameter, made of green crystal) closer to the planet's surface and then dropped it onto the [[aelvar]] capital. The mage-emperors reacted and shattered the moon as it fell, partially shielding the direct impact site, but too late. The falling rocks turned the ground to shattered glass (on the peninsula known as [[Moon's Fall Vengeance]]) and carved out ring-shaped craters. The walls now are mountains, and part of them has filled with water due to the formation of the [[Primal Sea]].

Shards of the moon remained. One particular shard, falling into what is now the [[Jungle of Fangs]], was entrapped by [[Awakener]]-possessed druids and used as a power source until the [[Awakener]] was defeated by the [[Dimwit Syndicate]] and their allied forces in 211 AC. The much-diminished kami now provides blessings from that temple.

      <text bytes="8180" sha1="5upw1yrr59wlquinm6780cfv3sjwjah" xml:space="preserve">The largest and wealthiest city in the [[Federated Nations]], Rauviz City is its own city state (the [[Free State of Rauviz]]) and is the hub of commerce for the entire region. Basically all of the trade goods destined for (or coming from) the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]], the [[Duarchy of Kotimaa]], the [[Uulan Confederacy]], or [[Shinevog]] (not to mention the parts further east) flow through Rauviz City--if not in literal fact, the banking and accounting for those goods certainly does. Even much of the trade between those nations is tied to Rauviz City.

Once the second city in the [[Council Lands]], known for its active criminal element and its loose adherence to the guild system, Rauviz is now considered by some to be the "capital of the world." Though this is presumptuous (and lacking in truth), it speaks to the attitude that Rauvians have toward their city and toward the other nations.

==Overview==
; Population: Roughly 35,000.
; Racial makeup: Cosmopolitan in the extreme. People from any of the [[Federated Nations]] can be found here. A slight plurality of wall-builder humans, however.
; Economy: Trade and commerce, including banking and oversight as well as warehousing and transshipment.
; Government: A council of burghers, elected by votes in proportion to property owned.

==Map==
[[File:Rauviz.webp|frameless|800x800px|Rauviz City district map]]




===Districts===
The dark brown areas are the old money areas, often part of the old city. Light brown are the newly-wealthy. Dark yellow-orange are the prosperous merchants and commercial districts; lighter yellow are the lower-class merchants and industry. Green are the slums and industrial areas.

* '''Rauviz Keep''': A relic of the former government, this is where the council meets as well as a public museum paid for by patronage of the wealthy. This includes the continent's only opera house.
* '''Old High District''' and '''Lakewatch''': These two districts in the old city are home to families that trace their descent and wealth back to the early settlers. They are nobility without actual titles or authority. Young-money families often marry into the impoverished old families, infusing them with cash in exchange for the honor of the name.
* '''Temple District''': this is where the old temple of the Seasons stood--it has been replaced with an ecumenical temple open to all.
* '''Highkeep''': This is the highest-status of the younger districts.
* '''Old Halfling Quarter''': This area is still home to several wealthy halfling clans--the buildings are sized for the short folk and would require almost total rebuilding to be used by others.
* '''Old Dockside''': The old port district, this is the "high class" red light district, with inns, clubs, and brothels patronized by the wealthy.
* '''Inner Ring''': This is where most of the new-money people strive to live.
* '''Riverside''' and '''Lakeside''': The new high-class docks districts (Riverside being lower-status). Mainly passenger boats here, as well as couriers.
* '''Southbridge''': The low-class docks. Rough area.
* The '''Stinks''' and the '''Sticks''': Industrial and slum areas. The Stinks is where all the odoriferous industries congregate--tanneries, butcheries, etc. The wind from the lake pushes the stink further inland away from the city.
* '''Council Row''', '''Outer Ring South''', and '''Marketside South''': Gentrifying areas--this is where those who aspire to better things (but haven't achieved them) live. The latter two are higher status than the former, with residents much more likely to own their own apartments or small houses.
* '''Marketside North''', '''Kela Loran's Smile''', '''Outer Ring North''', '''Grainmonger's District''', and '''Outdistrict''': Commercial districts. Businesses, often with residences above them. Grainmonger's has deteriorated recently.

== Organizations ==
The following are significant players in Rauviz City.

=== Criminal Orgs ===

# The '''Dockside Mutual Assistance organization'''. The GMA's (Deemas as they're frequently called) are the high-class, nearly-legitimate underground. They provide much of the security for the in-wall sector via their legitimate arm, which also does quiet money-lending and most of the entertainment (both salacious and otherwise) for the rich, famous, or otherwise big spenders. Their ''illegitimate'' arm provides drugs, unsavory pleasures, and extortion (often including kidnapping) for the high-class citizens. Several of the burghers are well-known to be members of the GMA. Their members wear a red armband with an anchor on it.
# '''Greystreet Boys.''' Contrary to their name, the Boys are led by a tiny, foul-mouthed kliba halfling known as Lady Sugar. They grew out of a youth gang and have come to dominate the northern part of the out-wall of Rauviz (north of Market Road, but with influence in Marketside South. They specialize in commercial "insurance" (although they do provide actual policing for that area as well, making it one of the safer zones) and have regulated theft--residents and merchants buy theft insurance, which means that if more than a certain value of goods are stolen or the thieves use unnecessary force, the Boys will hunt them down and break their legs or worse. They also do a lot of smuggling and fencing of illicit goods, although not much in the way of drugs (at least to be sold within their area). Their members wear genteel clothes--a particular plaid pocket hanky is their recognition symbol.
# '''[[Riverside Shadows]]'''. The Shadows are the least cultured of the three main criminal organizations in Rauviz. They control the slums south of Market Street by force and ruthless violence. They're especially known for using the youth gangs as a training ground. The only reason they haven't been crushed by the other groups is that they've made deals with the owners of the factories and the slumlords to bust up any worker's rights demonstrations or other impediments to exploitation. Their calling card is a black scarf tied around the head or neck.

'''Other Groups'''

Much of the slums (the green areas in the map) are terrorized by youth gangs, each controlling a few blocks. The Shadows use them as foot soldiers when they're not setting them against each other. Those that grow up on the streets learn to evade them...or join them.

One other group of significance is the enigmatic Bluejays, so-called because they leave behind a blue origami bird at the scene of each of their heists. This small group of thieves prides themselves on hitting only the most exclusive, well-guarded targets. The goods usually re-appear, sometimes ''in the same place they were stolen from'' within a few days, but sometimes appear when and where it would be least convenient--stolen jewelry around the neck or in the home of a political rival, stolen secrets plastered on the walls of buildings in broadsheets, etc.

=== Merchant Houses ===

# '''Cheesemonger's Society'''. This group is less of a merchant house and more of a cross between a legitimate shipping company, a smuggling ring, and a merchant coalition. Formed by four of the oldest merchant houses of Rauviz reaching an agreement with the smugglers from [[Rabbiton]] and monied interests from [[Crisial City]] and named something innocuous, it has its hooks into most of the trade between all the cities of [[Lake Coy'in]]. There are rumors that it has established a city/plantation somewhere in uncontrolled territory along the lakeshore, but those are unconfirmed. Their flag is that of a wheel of cheese with a slice taken from it, gold on a blue background.
#'''Spode's Landholding.''' The dominant landowner/slumlord (owning outright or in part about half of the Sticks and Southbridge and having substantial fingers in most of the Stinks as well as even as far north as Marketside South is [[Roderick Spode]]. He and his organization (Spode's Landholding, headquartered in the Inner Ring near Market Road) hire large numbers of muscle and are known to have a strong working relationship (if strained at times) with the [[Riverside Shadows]]. Roderick is a prominent member of the [[Cheesemonger's Society]].

Dominated by dwarves and other hardy folk, this is a land of harsh weather and wandering monsters, as well as a land steeped in ancient traditions dating back to the First Age.

The "pure" water plane, Ocean is, as the name suggests, an aquatic plane. There are islands of air in giant bubbles (some of which are the size of continents and hold huge civilizations), but most of the life is in the sea. The sea floor ranges from shallow to thousands of miles deep. Here, secrets are lost and knowledge gained...but at what price?

These races are the beast-touched.

'''Ability Score Increase'''. One ability score of your choice increases by 1. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Age'''. Beast-touched age at a similar rate as humans, living slightly longer. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Size'''. Beast-touched vary greatly in size, but your size is Medium.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Speed'''. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Languages'''. You speak Common and one other language of your choice. &lt;br/&gt;

==Udaaka (Bird-folk)==
Their ancestors were altered with bird traits to act as messengers and singers. Many of them have escaped with [[chaudeekar]] help and now inhabit the Planes of Air; others are found in [[Ithemba]].

'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Dexterity and Charisma scores each increase by 1. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Flight'''. You have a flying speed of 50 feet while you are not encumbered or wearing heavy armor. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Talons'''. You have natural weapons that can be used for unarmed strikes. They act as versatile weapons with a 1d4 damage die, dealing slashing damage. &lt;br/&gt;

==Sher-ka (Cat folk)==
'''Ability Score Increase'''. Your Dexterity score increases by 2. You cannot increase this further with any racial ability score increase. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Darkvision'''. You have superior vision in dark or dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of grey. &lt;br/&gt;
'''Claws'''. Your claws grant you a climbing speed of 20 ft. You have natural weapons that can be used for unarmed strikes. They act as versatile weapons with a 1d4 damage die, dealing slashing damage. &lt;br/&gt;

      <text bytes="5680" sha1="svpo4epye8pnqrb2kprt8oa6ddyx1pc" xml:space="preserve">The Horse Clans are the obvious inhabitants of the [[Lupaus Plains]]. Nomadic, horse-riding wind elves, they range across the plain during three seasons, returning to a "holy" place for the winter. Extremely closed-off and xenophobic, they only allow others on the outskirts of the plain, and that by sufferance and treaty only.

In reality, the Horse Clans (Hevonen, in their dialect) are but one element of a much more complex society. They serve as the outriders and warders, the disposable buffer between the core clans and the "evil" outside world. As such, they are the lowest-class group. The other groups are the Karja (Cattle Clans) and the Puuha (Sacred Ones). Together, they call themselves the Seraaja Vetelaja (Ser-AA-zha Ve-tel-AH-zha), the Followers of Vetel. The name "Vetel" does not translate further.

Within the three groups there are cross-cutting family groups that also have importance. But very little is known about these groups.

==Hevonen==
Making up about 20% of the population, the Hevonen gather in small, non-family-based bands and range across the entire [[Lupaus Plains]]. They are nomadic hunter-gatherers and live in tents with very little in the way of possessions beyond personal weapons and tools. The horses they ride are the best on the continent, and fetch extremely high prices in the rare instances where they are sold. Only geldings are ever sold, with one exception[0].

Each band has a Speaker, who is the external face of the clan. While others may learn Common, only the Speaker is allowed to hold trade or eat with outsiders without ritual contamination. For those bands operating near the Outside, the Speaker acts as the leader of the band.

One oddity is that the society is somewhat segregated by age--the Hevonen are almost all young adults (between the ages of 15 and 30), with an older priestess or shaman attached to the larger bands. They use the word "sibling" to describe others of their bands.Those who reach the "age of ripeness" transfer to the Karja and settle down, while Karja children are often sent to join the Hevonen. Hevonen have families/mates/children as well, but generally there is very little jealousy or partnering within a band--everyone sleeps with whomever they like and pregnant women who can't keep up with the fast-riding bands join the nearest Karja band and leave their children (post-weaning) with members of their family group there. Pregnant Hevonen are considered "unclean"--a pregnant woman and her escorts fly a "curse flag"[1] granting them passage with impunity through any band's territory. Family group membership follows the mother--fathers are not considered important, and many women can't even identify which band-sib was the father. Pregnancy, however, is quite rare as there are reliable contraceptives available from the herb-masters of the bands.

Individual bands are in competition with each other for the best range and breeding stock. These competitions are rarely fatal, but elaborate raids are conducted. Bands are generally not welcome in each others' territory unless they're flying an appropriate curse flag. 

Bands range in size from 20 to 100 individuals, but average around 30 in number. Each rider has between 3 and 6 horses that are used as remounts and baggage haulers. They subsist on ''maltazh'', a pemmican-like dish of dried and pounded meat and fat mixed with berries and other gathered vegetables. This nutrient-dense food keeps very well, and a small amount satisfies a lot of energy and nutrient needs. It doesn't, however, taste very good. They also carry small amounts of dream liquor, an incredibly potent alcoholic drink made by the Karja.

==Karja==
The Karja (Cattle Clans) are much more slowly-moving and more pastoral than truly nomadic. Like the Hevonen, these are non-family-based groups. Much larger than Hevonen bands, Karja bands range in size from 150 to nearly 1000 adults. They herd sheep and cattle. Although they also ride horses (which come from the Hevonen), they are significantly more settled. They will stay in place in a camp for weeks. Each band usually has 3 seasonal camp zones and moves to available fodder within those zones. Like the Hevonen, they winter elsewhere. They live in brightly-painted wagons of unusual design and materials. Since outsiders only have ever seen them from a distance (and that rarely), not much is known about them.

With many (~50%) of the young adults sent to the Hevonen, the Karja are much older populations. They have stable tribe organizations (with a chief and usually a shaman as leaders). Unlike the Hevonen bands, they cooperate and coordinate efforts. Much of this is done via the priestesses of Vetel. These women (always women) are chosen as young girls (around age 8) from the Karja and sent to [[Pyhin]]. Many never return; the ones that do come back as distant shadows. All the chosen priestess-candidates fit the same physical mold--slim, ash-grey hair (uncommon among the wind elves), and with the promise of much beauty.

The Karja create much of the gear that the Hevonen use, receiving horses in exchange (which they use to pull their wagons and run the herds). They are not known for being metal workers, though. Which raises the question as to where they obtain their metal tools.

==Puuha==
These peoples are only known from phrases mentioned by drunk Horse Clan. They are supposedly the "holy" people who stay in [[Pyhin]] year round, nearest the goddess Vetel. Very little else is known, except that they have a reputation as being fine (if odd) craftsmen. Horse clan will sometimes say that a piece is "almost worthy of the Puuha" when praising it.

==Mockers (Historical)==
The Mockers were an unofficial criminal organization in the [[Council Lands]] throughout the latter part of that nation's existence (roughly from 180 AC until the breakdown of the council system). Unlike the official Thieves Guild, they were not recognized and were outlawed. Operating mostly in the cities, they stole, fenced, and ran illicit (and untaxed) games and vice rings throughout the cities. They also served as an alternate social relief valve in finding new identities for people who were unhappy with their [[Oracles]]-ordained lot in life. This latter function is why they were unofficially allowed to exist. They and the Thieves Guild were in bitter opposition.

Organized in a loose, almost cell-like fashion, there was no public leader, only a network of territory masters and their soldiers.

==Current use==
Currently, the term "mocker" has been applied to any upstart, non-compliant (with the normal underworld protocols) underworld organization. Saying "the mockers did it" is a way of disclaiming responsibility and proclaiming ignorance of who was responsible for an action.

      <text bytes="3887" sha1="bumc0vasjmt2gfpqd6h4kwgzotiifqt" xml:space="preserve">==Quick Facts==
A mid-sized town of about 8,000 people located on the Lupaus Plain. The only substantial city on the plain, it mainly serves as a caravan resupply point and reshipment depot for trade between Wyrmhold and parts east. Much farming and ranching goes on around the town as well (producing food for the trade caravans). 

Water-born shipments along the Kairen (to Baile Duchas and Lyodnoir), Vodlanoi (to Byarsha), and Khol rivers (which join nearby) are transferred to caravans along the Dragon Road to the east (and vice versa). Although the joined river (the Khol) stays navigable until it empties into Lake Coy'in, river traffic is forbidden downstream of Vaeltaa because that passes too near the holy site of Pyhin (holy to the Horse Clans). This makes Vaelta the gateway to Wyrmhold. 

And presents tensions as the Wyrmholders are not happy with this state of affairs. Vaeltaa belongs to the Crisial Kingdom, who has made treaties with the local Horse Clans (who have butted heads with Wyrmhold and its expansionist ways in the past). This means that any attempt to annex Vaeltaa would require a major operation and would likely start an all-out war. This does not stop Wyrmhold from looking for ways to alter the situation.

The town has no real government structure. Guarding is done by goons hired by the trading companies, and focuses on the warehouse districts. There is a local militia under the blacksmith, Agata, but that is rarely used.

Both of the owners are law-abiding citizens with no hidden secrets or notable personality quirks. Before owning the tavern, one of the owners worked there under the previous owner, while the other made a living as a writer. The inspiration for the tavern's name was the Horse Clans. It is a tavern of aristocratic quality, and its main draw is the varied cuisine prepared by a talented chef.
			
==The Bartender==
The bartender at the Sign of the Horse is an older female wood elf (Byssian) who is pretty attractive. She is often uncommonly affable in disposition. Her skin is light, and she has red hair, kept in a tight bun style. Physically, she is particularly muscular.
			
==The Clientele==
On a typical night, the clientele at the Sign of the Horse can be described as remarkably secretive. On this occasion, there are around twenty other people currently in the tavern, engaged in several conversations, mostly about the recent trade issues. A number are obviously from Wyrmhold (orcs and dragonborn), while the rest are mostly Crisial natives (humans). There seems to be some bad blood, each side blaming the other for the recent thefts and the trade stoppage.
			
==The Accommodations==
The rooms for rent at the Sign of the Horse are huge and pristine. There are currently three rooms available for rent. The cost for a night's stay is 3 gp, 4 sp. If the party spends the night in the tavern, nothing happens during the night and the party wakes up after a night's rest.

The Boot and Bear is owned by a widowed woman (Sarah) and her daughter (Melanie), both of whom are wall-builder humans. Melanie has no hidden secrets or unusual quirks, but Sarah suffers from an old injury. Before owning the tavern, Sarah worked there under the previous owner, while Melanie served as a soldier in service to the nation. The inspiration for the tavern's name was an inside joke. It is a tavern of squalid quality, and its main draw is the fact that it's one of the only safe bars in town.
		
==The Bartender==
Melanie tends the bar because she enjoys doing the job herself. Her disposition is generally described as positively quiet. She is attractive with light skin and light brown hair in a long, straight style. Physically, she is truly svelte.

==The Clientele==
On a typical night, the clientele at The Boot and Bear can be described as absolutely rude. On this occasion, there are a few other people currently in the tavern. A couple of them are discussing religious or political matters. Leaning against the far wall, there is a depressed looking figure. They are actually a powerful fey creature, who will just have fun messing with the party and telling them all sorts of crazy things.
		
==The Accommodations==
The rooms for rent at The Boot and Bear are terribly tiny and astonishingly dingy. There are currently three rooms available for rent. The cost for a night's stay is 6 cp. If the party spends the night in the tavern, the owner who suffers from an old injury has an accident in the kitchen when it flairs up again.

The Fractured Coin is a tavern in [[Vaeltaa]] owned by an unmarried woman and her female business partner. One of the owners, named Eldra, is a jazuu, while the other owner is a wall-builder human named Karen. The human is the head of the local criminal group, and the other is secretly cursed with lycanthropy (rat). Before they owned the tavern, both owners worked there under the previous owner. The inspiration for the tavern's name was a story from the owner's past. It is a tavern of squalid quality, and its main draw is the fact that it's dirt cheap. And the back room has illegal (untaxed) gambling, and there are pit fights in a hidden room below. Any rogue (proficient in Thieves' Cant) can gain access freely, as can anyone with the Criminal background.
		
==The Bartender==
One of the owners of The Fractured Coin tends the bar because she enjoys doing the job herself. Her disposition is generally described as terribly energetic. She is ugly with mid-toned skin and shiny hair in a ponytail style. Physically, she is profoundly hairy. Which is weird for a jazuu. She also acts as her own bouncer much of the time, doing so with glee.
		
==The Clientele==
On a typical night, the clientele at The Fractured Coin can be described as particularly raucous. On this occasion, there are a few other people currently in the tavern. A couple of them are arguing over how to split the bill.
		
==The Accommodations==
The Fractured Coin is just a bar and doesn't have any rooms for rent.

It occupies the [[Solar Highlands]] region, but has client states to both east and west.

==WIP facts==
* Founded by Pyderi fab Pwyll, a surviving member of a collateral branch of the [[Aelvar]] imperial line after [[Moon's Fall]] and the sundering of [[Soefra]] from [[Noefra]].
* Same family has ruled. In fact, the emperor is actually the son of the first emperor, preserved through magic. The name "Kel'tan" means Immortal Phoenix and is the dynastic name.
* All of the nobles are related to the current emperor, often along multiple lines.
* Strongly stratified society
** Emperor [[Hafgan ap Kel'tan]] [HAF-gan ahp kel-TAN], born during the last days of the Aelvar empire and preserved through significant spells. Rumored to be failing around 251 AC. He has had countless wives, concubines, and descendants over the millennia of his reign. But anyone who threatens his reign (including by growing popular or too powerful) is destroyed.
** Pure-blood nobles (all bearing the title of Prince or Princess).
***The Emperor's advisors are the 7 most powerful mages in the land, known as the [[Archmagistrate of Kel'tan|Archmagistrate]] and the members given the title Archmagos.
***Regional governors (heads of coalitions of noble houses) are the Ardhri [ARD-ree] (roughly High King).
***Each of the noble houses is led by a Ri [REE] or king.
***Adult members are known as Prince or Princess, with "Phoenix" prepended to those within a certain number of generations of the Imperial line.
** Pure-blooded commoners (those who can't trace their lines to the emperor) -- these are the "free people" or yeomen and have some rights.
***Commoners are also arranged into Houses, with the same basic structure as the [[High Houses]] of [[Noefra]]:
****Led by a Housemaster and/or Matriarch
****Day to day operations handled by the Taniste [TAAN-ist].
****Male adults are titled aer, females tlyssau.
****Those not yet formally adults are unproven.
** Magebred -- these are those whose genetics have been altered by magic. These belong to nobles. Two classes: Greater and Lesser. Greater magebred can be taught wizardry, while lesser cannot legally be instructed in the secrets.
*** Gwerin magebred -- "half-breeds". Greater. Treated almost like pure-blooded commoners, as long as they don't show obvious signs of their alterations. The bulk of the magebred populace. Workers, etc.
*** [[Chaudeekar]] overseers. Greater. These are the highest of the non-gwerin types and act like it.
*** [[Sena'ka]] legions. Greater. Bred for war and guarding. Heavily indoctrinated from birth.
*** [[Kaua]] spies. Lesser. Spies, secret agents, and messengers. Live in large flocks that owe allegiance to a noble family. Often fanatically loyal.
*** [[Udaaka]] artists. Lesser. Kept as artists, singers, etc. Treated like decorative objects.
*** Beast races. Those who are even less humanoid. Field slaves.
* The empire controls 3 [[Portal Network]] endpoints: one in [[Kel'tana]] and one near each of the eastern and western edges in [[Kel'blaen]] and [[Kel'afon]]. Access is strictly restricted to the reigning nobles of those areas and the access procedure is highly obfuscated.

== History ==

=== Founding and Golden Age (3900 BC - 2650 BC) ===
Not much is known outside the empire about this part of history. The empire expanded and controlled all of [[Soefra]]; it also saw the creation of the various beast peoples.

=== Decadence and Retreat (2650 BC - 1 BC) ===
As time wore on, the Emperor (and thus the Empire) turned inward, growing more and more obsessive and involuted. In 2550 the Empire withdrew from the [[Great Rift]] due to internal politics. The client states of [[Dusk]] and [[Dawn]] were formed and (in the later years), the rebel state of [[Two Moons]] broke off from exiled nobles and magebreeds.

The emperor became more and more reclusive and his decrees both more sporadic and stranger; the [[Archmagistrate of Kel'tan|Archmagistrate]] assumed much more power.

=== Cataclysm and Degeneration (1 AC - present) ===
The [[Cataclysm]] and attendant disruption of magic (especially arcane magic, the lifeblood of the empire) hit the Phoenix Empire hard. The Emperor became a total recluse, appearing only once in a generation. The Noble Houses became much less interested in the outside world; the client states are almost entirely cut off and doing their own thing. Most of the dynamic, motivated people have moved out to the client states, leaving the [[Solar Highlands]] populated by the deeply tradition-bound and those delighted by infighting.

By 240 AC, the signs of the Emperor's degeneration have become unmistakable (although none dare say so openly for fear of the enforcers). It's widely rumored that the magics keeping him alive were broken by the [[Cataclysm]] and that he is dying. What happens when he dies is...uncertain. What happens when the immortal passes on?

== Rankings of Power and Titles ==
Being a mageocracy, rankings based on personal arcane power are fundamental to how gwerin of different Houses relate (along with social ranks). In formal matters or to preserve neutrality, each rank has a particular signature garb.

# Archmagos -- the top of the top. There can only be 7 of them (plus the Emperor himself, who is accorded a rank beyond Archmagos). High-collar white cloak with a phoenix in red and gold on the back. Each of the 7 has a special ring with a unique emblem on it.
# High Adept -- those who have mastered all the formal schools of magic--while they may have a specialty, they are omnicompetent with all forms of wizardry. High-collar white cloak with red trim and a hood. No phoenix.
# &lt;School&gt; Adept -- those who have mastered one school of magic. They may have some capabilities in other fields, but not to the point of mastery. A black cloak with the emblem of their school of mastery on the back in silver.
# Specialist -- those who have mastered one sub-school. Note--they may even have capabilities that Adepts don't have, but very narrowly. Most sorcerers end here. A black cloak with sigils relating to their specialty on the sleeves.
# Journeyman -- the vast majority, they have left their apprenticeship but are not masters. A long robe varying in color by preferred school.
# Apprentice -- those just embarking on the study of the arts arcane. A grey robe with their master's sigil on the right breast.
# Initiate -- those who have learned a spell or two. No special garb
# Unlettered -- everyone else.

Founded in 208 AC by the Commerce Guild to handle trade with the rest of the newly-formed [[Federated Nations]], it grew tremendously in power when it was selected to handle the logistics for the liberation of [[Godsfall]] in 211 AC. After the [[Crystal Spire War]] and the reconfiguration of the [[Council Lands]], it grew and absorbed (or allied with) all of the major trading houses. Currently headquartered in [[Rauviz]], it is the single largest merchant house in the [[Federated Nations]] and a dominant player in the economy.

Known for being hard-nosed and greedy, but not corrupt, it has kept its dominant place through hard dealing, efficiency, and diligent work.

Home to the [[Kel'tan]] Empire, it has been altered over the centuries to be almost park-like. Wild terrain is only left in small "preserves" that are carefully tended so as to be artfully "wild". Ringed by mountains and at an average altitude of 7,000 ft., the highlands should be cold and dry. Instead, they've been transformed into lush grasslands by centuries of [[gwerin]] magics.

===Natural Features===
The northern area, near the [[Riftwall Mountains]] is dominated by Oerllyn (ORL-lin), a massive lake of very cold water. From this flows the Yoran river, which splits into the Gorlafon and the Dwaerafon (to the west and east, respectively) at the foot of Baewyd Peak. This peak stands nearly 25,000 ft, making it the tallest peak in [[Soefra]] and one of the tallest in the world. Built into its steep slopes is the capital of [[Kel'tana]], the Eternal City.

===Cities===
* Kel'tana. Capital. Portal node.
* Kel'oeran.
* Kel'yoran.
* Kel'blaen. Third largest city. Portal node.
* Kel'dein.
* Kel'afon. Second largest city, home to portal node.
* Kel'gorl. Western fortress city.
* Kel'dwaer. Eastern fortress city.
* Kel'nead. Smallest city.

      <text bytes="2179" sha1="qjiwg10snb4zktxz4zlytgmyaz1agm6" xml:space="preserve">Queen of [[Wyrmhold]], gold [[dragonborn]], head of Clan [[Shakti]], and titular high priestess of the [[dragonborn]] clans. Has retired from active monarchical (but not ceremonial and religious) duties, but still retains an outsized influence on politics. Her daughter, [[Elspeth ka Shakti]] is Queen Regnant currently.

Born in 176 AC to the former queen (Ciara ka Shakti), she ascended to the throne at age 22 when her mother was killed (along with much of the clan) in a desperate (but successful) gamble to head off a major [[Hungering Frost]] incursion. This event shaped her life and her outlook. She spent the next 15 years (until 211 AC) striving to defeat the Frost, becoming hardened and warlike in the process. Several unsuccessful attempts on her life by Frost agents have left her somewhat paranoid. After the Frost's destruction, she has retained her core need to protect her people at any cost, and an obsession with military power. Her influence has been toward expansion and fortification. "Take and Hold" and "Control the Supply Lines" have been her major policies. She remains a staunch opponent of liberalization or transition to a peace-time economy, although she's lost a lot of the latter fight. Her policies have always placed high priority on large military budgets and maintaining readiness even in the absence of a visible foe.

As of 250 AC and the events of [[Temple and Spire]], she has been forcibly retired by her daughter, [[Elspeth ka Shakti]] and confined to ceremonial religious duties.

;Demographic Information: Beatris is an elderly (~75) gold dragonborn. She lives and dresses austerely and in armor (or armor-appearing robes). She still maintains a masculine appearance, with no softness in dress or behavior. She walks with somewhat of a limp and often uses a cane (with a blade concealed in it). Mechanically, she's a noble.

;Personality Traits: Proud and unyielding. Very little mercy or softness.
;Bond: Will do anything to protect the nation and her people.
;Ideal: Safety. No one must harm the things or people she claims as her own.
;Flaw: Paranoia. She sees threats everywhere.

Located at the base of [[Last Resort Pass]], the only significant way out of the [[Nocthian Caldera]] to the eastern lands, Lyodnoir is a heavily-fortified city. Controlled by Clan [[Gal]], it is the bottleneck that connects the newly-settled lands in the [[Kairen Mountains]] and [[Nocthian Caldera]] to the fertile fields of [[Safehold]], the rich forests of [[Baile Duchas]], and the industrial might of [[Byarmarsh]]. As such, it has become a very rich city despite being low in population compared to the other national capitals.

      <text bytes="10700" sha1="n6200ebl8e39nsr423x3m3g4pp7yr6t" xml:space="preserve">The undead are bodies animated by beings originating at the [[Oblivion Gate]] at the heart of the Abyss. Essentially, they're animated by ''[[Jotnar|jotnari]]'' (yot-NAR-ee, singular jotnar), effectively anti-kami. Where the kami are manifestations of nature and creation, the ''jotnari'' are manifestations of negation and corruption. Their existence breaks down creation and drains anima from the world. Thus, an undead infestation in an area is often signaled by reduced fertility (both of plant life and animal life, including intelligent life); a prolonged infestation will cause the area to be completely sterile. ''Jotnari'' are present at low levels in many areas but are only a significant threat where the land has become corrupted to some extent. ''Jotnari'' (especially the minor ones) are not sentient as we know it [citation needed -[[Nidus]]]. Instead they're driven by an unceasing urge to destroy everything, especially life. They exist to kill living things and consume their anima; given enough anima they generally replicate. So undead infestations are contagious, given a supply of corpses.

It is important to note that there are many undead-like creatures that are not jotnari in origin. Those others are always mortal souls trapped (whether by duty, by curse, or by strongly-felt need) between life and death. While these do have a minor draining effect on the ambient anima (enough to survive), they are not inherently inimical to reality itself. Most ghosts, a very few liches, many mummies, revenants and other tomb guardians, as well as the Dutybound from [[Godsfall]] fall into this category. One way to determine whether a creature is jotnari in origin or not is to check whether its first instinct (when someone disturbs it) is to attack or to warn the intruder away. Most of the Trapped will try to communicate in some fashion. To be sure, many of the Trapped are themselves beings of malign intent--adventurers must use their own judgement to determine the truth of the matter. In addition, some of the higher-order jotnari undead are capable of communication and deceit, while a very few seem to fight their nature.

It should also be noted that the fey are fond of animating dead bodies in very undead-like fashion. As with all things fey, their purposes and intents are frequently inscrutable and hard to distinguish from malice. As a note on that matter, will-o-wisps are fey, not undead in origin.

==Lesser Corporeal Undead==
The lesser corporeal undead (skeletons, zombies, and the like) occur in two major ways--spontaneously and artificially.

Spontaneous undead arise where the [[Shadow]] veil is thin (often due to mass deaths, especially traumatic ones) and/or the corresponding area of [[Shadow]] has been touched by the Waste. So battlefields, necromantically-active catacombs, plague-ridden villages, etc. are the most common sites of spontaneous animation. Minor ''jotnari'', driven by a hunger for anima, find corpses (which are easy to animate because they still remember being alive) and flood in. Unlike most undead infestations, these types are generally relatively self-limiting as they need corpses and don't have the intelligence to hunt. When the supply of living creatures drops too far, they collapse and enter a stasis-like state, waiting for the breath of life to wake them again to feed.

Artificial lesser undead arise when a spell-caster (often of the demonic-cult variety, but there are others who dabble in necromancy) casts spells or conducts rituals to summon and bind jotnari to corpses. Unlike the spontaneous ones, these artificial ones are constrained by the spells and rituals to obey their master...as long as the spell lasts or is renewed. Being fueled by the spell's anima, they're much less dangerous to other life while under control. This does not make them safe--they still seek to destroy all existence and their presence still corrupts reality (and especially [[Shadow]]). But the draining/sterilizing effect is much less pronounced--a necromancer with a small stable of skeletons can go months before the symptoms become apparent. Of course, the necromancer does pay with his own vitality to some degree--prolonged contact with the undead causes premature aging and a particular pallor, along with dried, brittle hair and yellowed eyes.

==Incorporeal Undead==
Shadows, specters, wraiths, and shades are as close to "pure" jotnari beings as can exist. They form when a jotnar in the [[Shadow]]s consumes a spirit and takes over its nimbus and shadow body, converting it into a destructive presence. Whether in the [[Shadow]]s or after slipping through into the Mortal plane, these manifestations are some of the most destructive and contagious--those that they kill arise as more of their kind. Fortunately, they are susceptible to the purifying effects of sunlight due to their "bodies" of shadow-stuff. Also fortunately, they find it difficult to penetrate the barrier between the Mortal and the Shadows unaided unless that veil is very thin. Thus they are rarely seen near populated areas.

==Greater (Free-willed) Undead==
The primary distinction between the lesser undead and the greater ones is in whether they can speak and act under their own volition ''other'' than to attack living things. There are two major groupings (by power level) within the category of free-willed undead. Both originate similarly, as described below. In general, magic users can animate the intermediate category but not the greatest ones.

Unlike lesser undead, who arise when jotnari possess corpses without any fragment of life, the greater undead arise when mortals are strongly infected by jotnari while still alive and then die. Instead of only gaining control of the physical body (like the lesser ones) with only very limited memories and fragmentary ability to reason, the greater undead possess much or all of the memories of the living person whose soul was corrupted and can act on them. Their bodies inevitably show degeneration due to the draining effect of the jotnari presence, but they often consume living anima to counter this.

===Unwillingly-corrupted Undead===
Ghouls, ghasts, and the various forms of wights are the major players in this category. They arise when a soul is unknowingly and involuntarily corrupted by jotnari and then dies (except due to the bite of a vampire lord). In general, those that were more prone to their physical urges in life become ghouls and ghasts (differing primarily in their power), while those with more intellectual prowess become wights. Either way, they maintain their will and physical forms by consuming the anima of others. Ghouls (and ghasts) prefer the still-living flesh of victims, while wights drain the life-force directly. Like the lesser undead, they can enter a form of stasis if there isn't anything around to drain, but they show significant deterioration while doing so, becoming wizened and shriveled. This does not, sadly, affect their combat prowess.

While these can be reasoned with (and even controlled to a degree), their hunger for anima overwhelms almost everything else except basic self-preservation. And even self-preservation is a weak instinct. Necromancers of extreme skill can animate ghouls; there are legends of those mortal necromancers being able to animate and control ghasts and create mummies.

===Willingly-corrupted Undead===
Vampires and liches, unlike their lesser (but still-free-willed) kindred, got the way they are because, at some level, they chose to be corrupted. And in doing so, their mortal soul gained a measure of power over their corruptor. Their souls are still intact, but they must pay a constant price in the anima of others for this freedom--if they fail to do so, they degenerate into (very powerful) versions of their lesser kindred. Vampires were the first to discover the rites that could indefinitely prolong life, summoning a jotnar into their own bodies and trapping it, using the entropic fiend's anima-draining powers to augment their own and to stave off mortal death. This does come at significant risk, however, and each generation of vampires (created by draining a victim and sharing some of the vampire's own jotnari-infected fluids) is weaker and more susceptible to the bloodthirst inherent in their being. The original binding ritual is lost to history (thankfully, as those original vampire lords rivaled the titans in their might, with none of those ancient beings' compassion or desire for order).

The process also entails giving up the creative spark that makes one fully human--this starts with losing the emotions and desires of the person over the course of a decade or so and replacing them with cold obsessions. Vampires find it hard to grow in power except by giving into the jotnar corruption more deeply, which further distorts their desires and even their bodies. Go far enough, and only a monster remains. Vampires do ''not'' need to feed on blood, but many prefer the taste. Any significant contact is enough to drain anima from living beings to some degree; the "fanged kiss" merely does it more quickly and thoroughly. And the rush of power is the last true pleasure that many of the older vampires have left.

Liches arose first when arcanists (including the one that became the [[White Skull]]) studied the vampire lords and attempted to "improve" the process. They partially succeeded. The lichification ritual is a descendent and refinement of the vampiric ritual. By binding their souls into phylacteries, liches lost the ability to create more of their kind as simply as vampires do (a loss they do not particularly mind)--in exchange they have complete control of the corruption and retain their own minds and interests. They do, inevitably, lose the ability to grow in power (beyond horizontally). A wizard who became a lich while only being able to cast 5th-circle spells will never progress beyond that--only those that can die can grow. They do gain the ability to reconstitute themselves as long as the phylactery is intact, as their body is but a vessel of anima.

This was a partial success because liches are even more dependent on a steady supply of external anima. And in most cases, simply taking a life (or a portion of one) as vampires do will not do for a lich. They need ''souls'' to fuel the demonic pact that stabilizes their being. And they need them frequently--if they do anything other than simply exist, a lich generally will need to feed on a commoner once a day (or less frequently on stronger souls). Failure to do so means that their minds and powers unravel before the corruptor's touch and they wither into demiliches.

      <text bytes="5852" sha1="03wvar8a15mc6pyupglofw0qetm5v9b" xml:space="preserve">Kinlanna was the [[gwerin]] wife of [[Hvang Ssa'ka]] and sister to the [[Dark Lady]]. Wracked with guilt over the actions leading up to the re-emergence of the [[Towers of Sun, Earth, Moon, and Stars]] and redeemed by love of her husband and children, she enabled the [[Catalysts]] to enter her sister's fortress through the [[Portal Network]] there and delayed her sister's response until the party could disable her ritual. At the very end, she sacrificed her own existence to seal a breach in the [[Crystal Sphere]] torn by her sister's dying curse. She is still revered among the people of [[Asai'ka]] as a patron saint although there is nothing left to return the patronage. The people do not know that she was the [[Dark Lady]]'s sister and confederate for many years.

==Life before the Cataclysm==
Kinlanna was a high-house researcher and Head Librarian of the Tower of the Stars (the library tower at the [[Towers of Sun, Earth, Moon, and Stars]]. Non-political, she focused most of her efforts on her library and had little to do with the outside world. She bore the requisite children by a pair of contract marriages early on in her life, but had little or nothing to do with them or their fathers later. Her primary confidante and support was her sister, now only known as the [[Dark Lady]].

At the time of the Cataclysm, she was relatively young at about 350 years old (remember that pre-Cataclysm gwerin lived to at least one thousand years). Considered beautiful, she put minimal effort into her dress or accoutrements. She wore simple robes whenever possible, and her hair was tied back with a stick. Never the most powerful mage, her specialty was in archiving and organization rather than arcane might.

==The Cataclysm and Catastrophe==
When the final battle of the [[Cataclysm War]] was looming, the administrators of the Towers decided to activate their last-ditch defense mechanism--a highly-modified shield system developed from research into the [[concept bombs]]. This device was designed to wrap the towers in a bubble of [[Shadow]], effectively placing them out of reach of mortal hands in a pocket universe. It worked perfectly. Until the [[planar realignment]] in the wake of the Cataclysm. As a result, the Shadow Shield failed to unwind, leaving the towers stuck in a bubble of space-time and unable to reach the mortal realm. What's more, the attempt by the Tower of the Sun's personnel (in charge of power generation) to bring down the Shadow Shield also failed and the feedback destroyed that tower.

Without stable power, the towers became a madhouse of suspicion, paranoia, and hoarding. The [[Dark Lady]] took command, although she was the most paranoid. Eventually, she convinced Kinlanna to put the Tower of the Stars into stasis, knowing that that would kill every living being inside. Following her sister's lead and feeling incapable of resisting, she also participated in the ritual to summon and bind a demon of rage to fuel the [[Portal Network]] so that they could make their escape into the Mortal world, at the cost of all of their colleagues and friends in the Tower of the Moon.

==Living a Double Life==
The pair arrived in the Stone Throne roughly in 200 AC. Over the next 10 years, they infiltrated that society. The [[Dark Lady]], now pledged to the [[White Skull]], took control of the Southern District by killing the dictatorial Phraya and pretended to make the lives of the people better, while building a ritual to convert their souls into power. She sent Kinlanna to [[Asai'ka]] to seduce [[Hvang Ssa'ka]], the Phraya of the Central District to provide a bulwark against threats from the other two districts. But Kinlanna made a mistake at this point. She fell in love with that ancient alchemical monster, and he fell in love with her despite knowing her goals. They had two children together.

For the next 11 years, the pair of sisters ruled and lied. Steadily, Kinlanna became burdened by guilt and the knowledge of the atrocities her sister was planning. For her sister had one fatal flaw--she was paranoid of everyone ''except'' Kinlanna. She trusted Kinlanna with everything, every plan and every horror her mind could conjure. But Kinlanna was trapped--she had no one to turn to. Her husband was confined by Stone Throne law and unable to intervene in another district's business without permission of the priest-bureaucrats, who were also actively promoting demon worship.

==The Catalysts Arrive==
When the [[Catalysts]] arrived in [[Asai'ka]], Lady Kinlanna saw her light at the end of the tunnel. She summoned them and told them everything she knew. Thus armed, they defeated the High Priestess in the Holy City of [[Ar Salem Dolem]] and freed the [[Queen Ascendant]] from her demonic chains. With that obstacle down, she provided them the access key to the [[Portal Network]] node in the [[Dark Lady]]'s fortress and undertook the riskiest lie of her life. She visited her sister and distracted her in talk and amusement just long enough for the heroes to arrive with a full combat squad drawn from across the newborn [[Federated Nations]]. Finally understanding the nature of betrayal, the [[Dark Lady]] stabbed her sister and left her for dead before heading off to her confrontation with the heroes. But Kinlanna wasn't quite dead yet. With her last strength, she followed her sister, arriving just after the [[Dark Lady]] used one of the [[Fangs of Resolution]] to sacrifice herself in order to open a breach in the [[Crystal Sphere]] and light a beacon for the [[Awakener]]. Burning her own life force, Kinlanna took the party out beyond the breach; there they defended her from the threats from Beyond until she could conjure a patch made of her own soul for the breach. Thus ended the life of Lady Kinlanna.

      <text bytes="5551" sha1="kemci52ww22z9moowupja2iccphixyh" xml:space="preserve">A race of humanoid people native to the [[Solar Highlands]], the sena'ka were created by the mages of the [[Phoenix Empire]] in approximately 2900 BC as their elite warrior corps. In the following ages, the population has split. While many of them remain in the [[Phoenix Empire]], significant subpopulations have escaped to the [[Great Rift]] and even crossed the Western Sea to the islands near southern [[Oelfra]]. The largest population of sena'ka outside of the [[Solar Highlands]] is the [[Ship Folk]] of the [[Primal Sea]].

==Physical Description==

Physically, sena'ka are tall, lithe humanoids with yellow-toned skin mottled with brown spots (almost reptilian in appearance). Their noses are short with large nostril openings, giving them an alien look. Their eyes are large, slanted and usually dark in color, although grey is not uncommon. Their ears are quite pointed. Their hair is stringy and usually dark in color, often with a green cast to it. Many are balding on the front, giving them the appearance of a huge forehead. Sena'ka only very rarely carry any notable fat--their skin is usually stretched tight across a prominent bone structure. They also rarely show musculature, regardless of how strong they are.

There is little outward sexual dimorphism. Female breasts are small, and males rarely grow any facial hair. In fact, neither gender grows significant hair anywhere but on their heads, and many are completely bald.

They are frequently (and derogatorily) called "skull-faces", although not to those faces.

==Origin==

The sena'ka were created as the "next evolution" of humans, who had also been created recently by those mages from hobgoblin and elven souls. Two major concerns were addressed--loyalty and superiority. Unlike humans, with their adaptability and mutability, the proto-sena'ka were developed to be one thing and one thing only. Warriors willing to fight to the death for their masters. To this end, the phoenix mages bred in traits from a wide variety of creatures, including some artificially-created creatures. This engineering had some side effects (wanted and unwanted). For instance, sena'ka are less capable of handling cold weather than normal humans--their body temperature runs low and they become quite sluggish in the cold. They are better adopted to hot climates, however. Another, desired side effect was that the complexity of the engineering left them infertile without magical assistance. New sena'ka are bred in creches and raised outside of a family structure. In the Phoenix Empire, this lets them be raised as perfectly loyal fighters to whichever of the [[Phoenix Lords]] acts as their owner. Those populations that have escaped (and survived) managed to acquire the knowledge and skill to conduct the breeding rituals themselves. As a result of this, sena'ka outside of the empire consider their own lives as very precious. Even within their competitive, fractious societies, they only very rarely kill another sena'ka. It is to be noted that they generally do ''not'' treat other humanoid creatures with this same concern.

Another side effect was increased mental performance and power--sena'ka are intelligent (although most only turn that towards tactics in battle) and often develop strange, almost magical abilities fueled by their minds alone. This was the most prized and surprising effect of the engineering, and the phoenix mages spent centuries trying to replicate it in a controllable form. All these efforts ended in failure.

==Racial Traits==
'''Ability Score Increases''' Your Intelligence score increases by 1.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Age''' Very similar to humans, reaching adulthood in the mid-teens and living between 70 and 90 years.&lt;br/&gt;

'''Subrace.''' There is only one playable subrace of sena'ka at this time--the Ship Folk.

===Ship Folk===
Main Article [[Ship Folk]]

Raised in a fiercely competitive, maritime pirate culture that prizes strength above all, a few of the ship folk have made their homes on the southern shore of the [[Jungle of Fangs]]. Even fewer have become adventurers in the [[Federated Nations]], mostly outcasts from the main society.

'''Ability Score Increases''' Your Dexterity and Strength scores each increase by 1.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Pirate Weapon Training''' You are proficient with light and medium armor and with scimitars, hand axes, battleaxes, and hand crossbows.&lt;br/&gt;
'''Psionics''' You know the ''gust'' cantrip.&lt;br/&gt;

When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the ''jump'' spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the ''levitate'' spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells (DC = 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus). When you cast them with this trait, they don't require components.

'''Region of Origin''' Your region of origin is the [[Serpent Dominion]].&lt;br/&gt;
'''Sea Legs''' You are proficient with water vehicles. In addition, when you have to make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to keep your balance, you do so at advantage.&lt;br/&gt;

      <text bytes="2132" sha1="m77ocr9bv5woodjfbio2i7v36yvvupa" xml:space="preserve">The Lady's Grove is a druid circle located near [[Crisial of the Four Towers]]. Started by [[Catalysts|Safrir Tree-friend]] and the ancient tree-spirit known in these times as Sara, it is the most modern and progressive of the well-known druid circles in the [[Federated Nations]].

The Lady's Grove accepts those of any background who feel a tie to the [[kami]] and wish to further their understanding, whether they have the desire and potential to become druidic practitioners or not. The main demand of the circle is to pledge to work to tame the effects of mortals on the wilds and to strike balance between mortals and nature. They primarily act as mediators between mortals and the [[kami]]. Unlike some of the other groves, they accept technology and artificial construction as long as it's done with an eye to moderating the effects on the environment. Lady's Grove druids and shamans also teach responsible farming and circulate throughout the surrounding areas counseling and aiding farmers in farming sustainably, both for them and for the land. Many architects come to study the techniques taught here.

The basic philosophy taught here is the Circle of the Land (forests and plains, mostly).

There are currently (as of 250 AC) around 35 druids and druidic apprentices associated with the Grove, making it the second-largest circle in Western [[Noefra]], after the [[Moon Circle]] in [[Byssia]].

==Leadership==
Archdruid Safrir and Sara are co-leaders, although the organization is relatively loose. They're also lovers. There is very little hierarchy below them--the only ranks are druid (accepted, independent) and seeker (apprentice druids and those who come for short periods seeking knowledge and training).

Safrir remains the most powerful of the mortals, capable of casting 5th circle spells. But together with Sara, he's capable of much greater feats within the forest itself.

Of the 15 other full druids, 1 is capable of casting 4th circle spells, and 3 more of casting 3rd circle spells. The rest are weaker than that, with a full half only capable of casting 1st circle spells.

Husband of [[Kinlanna]]. Hvang Ssa'ka was the longest-lived mortal throughout the [[Federated Nations]]. Even now, three decades after his death, there are rumors that he merely "retired" and is still alive somewhere.

==Early Years==
Born a few years before the [[Cataclysm]] (his exact age is not known), Hvang Ssa'ka was the son of a minor noble in the [[Stone Throne]] with ancestral lands near what is now [[Asai'ka (City)]]. While a young man, he led the retreat from the Central District to [[Kel'al'ar]] due to the rampant beasts and disasters attendant to the [[Cataclysm]]. For the next 25 years, he took up alchemy as a replacement for traditional magic, and mastered the art. Somehow he found a way of delaying aging tremendously during this period--by the return to the Central District 25 years after the retreat, he looked much the same as he did at the retreat.

He did not maintain lordship over the southern refugees, preferring his alchemical studies. But when magic returned and an expedition was mounted to retake the heartland, he was chosen to lead that expedition.

==Return and Rulership==
The return to the Central District and the founding of [[Asai'ka (City)]] did not go without incident. Many battles were fought against beast creatures (mostly giant and goblinkind, but also many [[ophidian]]s) and Hvang's military reputation was made here. Once peace returned, he accepted the role of Phraya of the refounded Central District.

For the next 150 years, he ruled with a light (if inconsistent) hand. He mostly ignored the merchant caste and let them set their own policy, only stepping in when needed to quell serious disputes that threatened the general peace. Those that broke the law often just disappeared without trial; word on the street was that they were used as experimental subjects.

Hvang did not take a formal wife until his marriage to [[Kinlanna]] in 200 AC. He dallied with many women and fathered numerous illegitimate offspring; while he never ''denied'' paternity, he never claimed them as his heirs and they inherited their mothers's positions (with some getting small stipends anonymously). He did not restrict himself to noble-caste women either--he had children across the spectrum including with several [[ophidian]] women. None of these women ever gained any status from it.

When Kinlanna arrived ca 200 AC, the two immediately fell deeply in love and were married. She provided the erratic noble with stability; he brought her joy and respite from grief and guilt. They had two children: Kagome Ssa'ka and Sel, now surnamed Ichiban. Kagome was said to resemble her mother tremendously, almost as a younger copy, while Sel was handsome but had a weakness about him (despite being physically powerful). Hvang always preferred Kagome and disdained Sel.

==Later Years==
After Kinlanna's death in the Liberation, Hvang turned dark. His moral center removed, he became even more erratic and withdrawn. By 215 AC, much of the direct rulership quickly fell to Kagome's new husband, Phra Solkan. While young, he was competent and driven. Hvang stayed in his laboratory, and the disappearances from the streets became more frequent. He only had time for Kagome.

In 220, he officially retired as ruler. His official heir was Kagome, but Solkan ruled in her place. Then, in 225, she fell ill and died soon after the birth of their second child, a daughter named Saiko. The loss of his last anchor broke Hvang. Retreating to his lab, he embarked on a series of experiments that ended up with the explosive destruction of his entire estate. Officially, he died in 226 AC. In the resulting chaos, Sel claimed the throne by right of birth and changed his surname to Ichiban, cutting ties with the memory of his father.

True Hold is the fortress town where the hardcore faction of the [[Sin Eaters]] make their home. Located on the western shore of the [[Sea of Dreams]] about 50 miles from [[Pilvin Koti]], it is home to approximately 3,700 inhabitants, the vast majority of whom are humans. A few wood elves and even fewer dwarves and halflings have joined the [[Sin Eaters]]. A substantial number of the inhabitants are dockworkers, teamsters, and mercenaries; these are rigidly controlled and confined to the sections of the city outside the wall (ie Wrath for the mercenaries and teamsters and Seafarer's and Judgement for the dockworkers). Outsiders are not allowed within the walls except by approval of the Silver Stars. 

Strict purity rules govern the interactions of residents, especially where outsiders are concerned. Outsiders within the wall must register with the Cathedral upon arrival, and are housed in one particular group of lodging houses in the Ward district. Only approved members of the community (noted by the silver, 8-pointed star badge that they wear) may interact with the outsiders and relay their requests to the other members. This is to prevent "contamination" by "foreign" beliefs. Only the most zealous and dedicated are chosen as Silver Stars.

The town subsists on farming, selling mercenary services, and fishing. As they are the only port for hundreds of miles in either direction (at least until [[Honedaxe]] finishes its port development), they also do a fair amount of transshipment trade with the nations of the [[Giant Spine Mountains]]. The mental gymnastics to allow this in their rigid, xenophobic religion are...fascinating to say the least.

==Notable People==
* Brother-General Dignitas: high general of the [[Sin Eaters]]. A former adventurer (pre-Federated Nations) and cleric, he led the [[Sin Eaters]] to [[True Hold]] and has shaped their doctrine ever since. At age 65, he's still physically and spiritually imposing. A true fanatic, he does not question the faith. But he's wise enough not to become angry or violent toward outsiders from the [[Federated Nations]].
* Sister-Admiral Penitentia: leader of the trade and fishing fleet. Another zealot, this younger, attractive human woman has no compunctions about using her womanly charms to manipulate the unbelievers.
* Brother-Preacher Pietas: head of enforcement. A firebrand half-orc, he burns with self-loathing and bitterness toward all the "unclean" races, including his own family. He's known for self-flagellation.

==Services==
* Market. Rank 3--all non-custom/magical work can be found here, but at 150% of normal price.
* Transport. Rank 2--can hire fishing boats at 15 gp/day. Larger boats or destinations more than one day out require approval from the Cathedral.

==Black Market==
As with any strictly authoritarian town, there's a thriving black market fed by smugglers. The authorities occasionally crack down, but corrupt guards give warning in advance and the police only find abandoned buildings. Generally, looking at one of the sleazier taverns in Wrath or Judgement is your best bet for finding the current location. But you'll need both cash and quick thinking.

Berserkers and soldiers, Bloodstand is home to people who love to fight. They are anything but subtle--they often coordinate with other groups for aid with scouting. They specialize in heavy combat. They accept mages and other magic-using support, but pride of place goes to those who wield weapons and stand on the front line. And the bigger the weapon, the better.

The Dragonslayers were founded by a former adventurer, [[Balthazaar]] vo [[Gal]]. Their mission is to fight monsters and bring trophies. The bigger and meaner the monster, the better. Their preferred methods involve fire, explosions, or big flashy magic. Swords and axes work too. They maintain an insurance policy (self-insured, because no reputable firm would underwrite them) against collateral damage caused by their members. All current members pay a fraction of their quest rewards into this pool, and it's constantly running low.

Working out of Black Market, the treaty town run by the [[Ship Folk]] at the southern end of the [[Jungle of Fangs]], this group was founded by former adventurers to assist them in establishing the [[Dimwit Syndicate]].

== Basic Information ==
Like all elemental planes, the Plane of Lava is not entirely made of what it sounds like. On the equatorial slice, it presents itself as a chain of volcanos--the space between them a rock-strewn volcanic moonscape. There is one major city, [[Nara Kara]], built into the slopes, lava tubes, and caldera of the largest of the volcanos, Mt Narak. Water is rationed, accessible only to those in good standing with the [[Cult of Burning Law]] who rule in [[Alastor, World Judge|Alastor]]'s name. What seas and lakes exist are brimstone-filled and require purification for mortals to drink. 

=== Ruler ===
The Plane of Lava is ruled by [[Alastor, World Judge|Alastor, called World Judge]], an ancient [[Wyrm]] who ascended during the first age as one of the very first [[Elemental lord|Elemental Lords]]. Of all the Lords, he is often judged to be one of, if not the strongest individually. Thankfully, his direct appearances are rare, for his justice is merciless. His will is carried out by the [[Cult of Burning Law]] via the Masked Judges who speak with his voice. From his judgements there is no appeal and no mercy.

=== Inhabitants ===
[[Plane-touched|Fire-touched]] [[dwarves]] and [[humans]], called "Vulkates", their [[plane-bound]] kin, fire giants, salamanders, and efreeti make up the bulk of the population. Very few un-touched mortals reside here--those that do are slaves bought from the [[Plane of Coal]] and tend not to live very long in the ash-strewn wastes.

=== Aspects ===
Conquest / Inevitability / Law

=== Unique Feature ===
The [[Grand Court]] -- an arena serving as a court of last resort for trial by combat. Used by people across the planes (although not usually by mortals). Combats are always to the death, and survival is proof of righteousness. The fights are always fair; the judges incorruptible. This is no place of amusement, no circus.

Held in imperial custody at [[Imperial Research Alpha]] before the [[War of Souls]], he survived the facility's step into timelessness by disassociating into multiple personalities. Later rescued as part of [[Tooth and Spell (Campaign)]], he was taken in and given therapy by Marcia.

Still a very home-loving, cautious soul (even more so after Marcia's wounding), he acts as the protector of the hidden roost where she lies in healing sleep. They had one daughter, the bronze dragon [[Nixi]] who currently resides in [[Auringon]] at [[Storyholm]].

Until 212 AC he was the secret leader of one of the cities of [[Abandoned Clans]] in the [[Giant Spine Mountains]], but when his nature was revealed he retreated to his den at the edge of the wastelands.

Known to be a coward when it comes to direct confrontation, Gozh is a powerful spellcaster who only acts through deception and manipulation of others. He spends most of his time in other shapes, manipulating and encouraging chaos within his (many) enemies. Forces manipulated by Gozh have been implicated in many sabotage and other hostile acts against [[Zhapai Karmap]], the rulers of which he carries a strong grudge against.

      <text bytes="2256" sha1="scblfuu179j9x50iexujur7cg8bypff" xml:space="preserve">The language of the [[gwerin]] people, Yonwach is a complex language with several modes depending on subject matter and audience. Phonetically, it relies on liquid vowels and palatalized consonants, as well as elaborate tonal and emphasis shifts. Words tend to be long and complex--new words are formed by aggregation. Subtle differences in word choice and grammar have huge effects on meaning--conversations in Yonwach tend to be multi-layered with puns, verbal assaults, and other indignities hidden among flowery compliments.

Its written form uses a composite symbol set where the basic syllable-symbols can be attached to each other to form new words (with more formalized rules for compound-word formation than in Sinitic languages) and written in two dimensions, with different patterns carrying meaning. This is usually only done in High or Court modes, however, as it's very inefficient for conveying normal information.

==Modes==

===Low Yonwach===
The common tongue, low Yonwach is what commoners speak to each other, as well as within families. Most non-gwerin who learn spoken Yonwach learn low Yonwach. Written from top to bottom, left to right. It lacks much of the status-markers and intricately-involved wording of the other modes.

===High Yonwach===
Spoken by nobles of different families, as well as at formal occasions, High Yonwach is a form of combat with words. Every statement has multiple layers, most of which are traps. High Yonwach has different grammatical constructions depending on mood, relationships, alliances, and even times of day. Everything you say is being judged.

===Court Yonwach===
The name is a bit of a misnomer. Court Yonwach mostly only exists in written form and for reading traditional [[gwerin]] poetry. The written form is the formal language of wizardry--most classically-trained wizards write their spellbooks in personal dialects of Court Yonwach and its spoken form is a traditional source of syllables for arcane spell-casting, especially among elves. High-caste poetry is also traditionally written and read in Court Yonwach. An even more flowery and confusing language than High Yonwach, it is strongly archaic and highly inefficient for anything like real communication.

== Terrain ==
Everything interesting in the plane is underground. At the borders with the neighboring planes (the [[Plane of Clay]] on one side and the [[Plane of Coal]] on the other), the endless mountains turn into hills and plains. But the plane itself is bare rock on the surface. Underground is hived with tunnels, caverns, rivers, etc.

== Capital City ==
Asil Tash [Ah-sil TAHSH]. Located in a huge cavern (~3-4 miles across, a mile high) buried in the central area of the plane, this city is half city, half tent city (the [[All-Things Bazaar]]). It also contains the blocky Silent House, combined residence of and temple to [[Korokonolkom]], as well as the administrative facilities for the Silent Guard and the Enduring Discipleship (the "military/police" and "religious/civil bureaucracy", respectively).

== Culture and Economics ==

=== Currency ===
The plane of Stone mints their own coins after the trade-coin pattern of the other elemental planes, and their coins, like those of Coal, are accepted most places. Officially called the "mountain", They come in two denominations--greater and lesser. But most people call them "tokens". Thin, roughly dollar-coin-sized slices of magically-toughened slate, they are etched with Koro's symbol on one side and a crown (for the greater) and nothing (for the lesser) on the reverse. One greater is 10 lesser, and 1 lesser is exchangeable for 2 Council  gold marks (aka 2 gp).

=== Culture ===
Bland and expensive food. Non-imported food is heavy on mushrooms and mystery crustacean/worm meat. Everything is for sale; nothing is free. In fact, it's insulting to give or expect free advice unless that's paid for by your job. Bribery is ''everywhere''--everything is transactional.

Debt slavery is common and highly regulated. Even reasonably fair and not considered chattel at all--slaves have strong legal protection. All slave labor goes through large "labor relations" firms.

      <text bytes="11982" sha1="6n8au9ay6x4dkb4d8lvdf6ca0a34jyv" xml:space="preserve">When the Alkh and the rest of the north-western Noefran dwarven clans made their exodus from their homelands in the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] in the wake of the [[Cataclysm]] and the volcanoes it brought to life, not all the clans followed. Some chose to stay behind. Others fell behind on the march and were left in the dust. Yet others were already pariahs, descendants of fallen clans. Whatever their reasons, this variegated remnant of the dwarven nations has made a precarious life for itself in the abandoned holds and harsh mountains of the Giant Spine range.

	The unifying theme for all the Abandoned is one of sacrifice, of pain, and of strife. Of bowing down to masters secret or open, of oppression and anger. They are a harsh, unforgiving, dour people. Their music is hard and angry, full of growls, screams, and guttural utterances. Very little in the way of art adorns their halls; even the metal- and stone-work, for which dwarves are everywhere famous is utilitarian and functional, with sharp corners and rough edges. “Rule or suffer; might makes right” is the operating zeitgeist.

==Three Cities, Three Nations==
Politically, the Abandoned have settled in three city-states and the surrounding valleys. These three are popularly known as Hate, Pain, and Dominance.

To the east of the Abandonment rise the nearly impassible peaks of the Grand Divisor range. To the north are the Jazhuu (goliaths and giants) of the Tuura Adam. To the south lies unclaimed lands dropping into the border of the Sea of Grass; to the west is the Sea of Dreams.

By 250 AC, they all politically follow the lead of Bolorhold. They're not formally unified, but each of the three will go and do what Bolorhold chooses (albeit with grumbling and backbiting).

One shared activity is the yearly "Blood Games" on the border with [[Zhapai Karmap]]. These gladitorial and athletic competitions attract athletes, gladiators, and monster-hunters from all over the [[Federated Nations]] and the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] and beyond. Much gold is bet, and much blood flows. It's basically war, but with more drinking and less hatred. Participate at your own risk.

===Xhort, City of Hate===
Xhort lies in the north-east corner of the region claimed by the Abandoned. As such, it’s on the front lines of the constant border squabbles with the [[Tuura Adam]]. The two sides despise each other—the Tuura consider the Xhort-ites to be cheaters and dishonorable contestants, while Xhort sees the Tuura as too concerned about fair play and thus impractical. There is not open war between the sides; some trade exists. But every interaction is fraught with violence and risk. The symbol of Xhort is the dragon’s maw in white with black eyes.

The population of Xhort and the surrounding area is about 9,000. Most of these work in the deep mines producing much of the iron and other metals for the Abandoned. They depend on food from Bolorhold.

Culturally, Xhort is a brutal, militaristic city-state with very little in the way of recreation or beauty. Everything is focused on building individual strength, although this is also their weakness. The strong rule over the weak, and the weak try to stab the strong in the back and scramble into their place. They are unified by their belief that they are the true inheritors of Bolorhold and they are taught from birth to hate “normal” dwarves.

Politically, Xhort was ruled in 212 AC by Boss Nafrat (commonly called Boss Xhort). He has ruled with an iron fist for the last 30 years but is likely to lose his grip in the near future as he ages and his injuries catch up with him. The most likely successor is Jahl, a strong berserker with a large following. Neither of them is incredibly intelligent or subtle—they rule through main force. This transition happened in 214 AC, in the wake of the revelation of Drak's identity and the ensuing civil conflict

At the side of the Boss used to be his advisor—each boss had one. The current advisor is only known as Drak, and his background is unknown. In reality (unknown to all but the Boss), Drak has been the only advisor, changing his face. He is the ancient (albino) black dragon [[Gozh]], the same that tried to engineer the downfall of [[Fuar Uulan]]. He has been warping the culture to one of constant hatred for dwarven-kind, planning to use them as a weapon in his feud. He was exposed and fled by the [[Wild Cards]] as part of their adventures there in 211 AC. 

In the wake of his departure, Xhort turned inward and had a small civil war. Politically, this has reduced them to being a minor power dominated by Bolorhold.

===Bolorhold, City of Pain===
The oldest city-state (by about a generation), Bolorhold was once a major manufacturing hold of the Bolor tribe before the Cataclysm. About 10 years BC, it was destroyed due to betrayal from clan Alkh and attack from without. The majority of the populace was slaughtered then; the survivors gathered in the aftermath of the Cataclysm, along with other exiled or forgotten dwarven clans.

Situated at the head of a set of fertile valleys fed and warmed by volcanic springs, Pain is the pre-eminent farming region of the Abandoned. As such, it boasts the largest population (nearly 20k) and the most wealth, as the other two cities depend on food produced in Bolorhold. Their symbol is a red fist upraised, with blood dripping from the inside.

Culturally, Bolorites are obsessed with pain and greed. Being practical people, this does not extend to death, merely pain. Their primary outlet are the Celebrations held once per season (and sometimes more frequently), where teams of gladiators fight in brutal matches against each other or against beasts. In addition, these Celebrations are times of accounting—residents who cannot pay their debts are scourged (with the state paying off the debt at a fixed price per blow). Other residents can bid to be the one to perform the scourging; any money in excess of the debt is paid to the debtor. Families are sold into slavery to pay debts. Crimes are adjudicated as monetary fines (which can be paid by pain, including by a slave). Death is forbidden, however, except for the most extreme crimes.

Politically, Bolorhold is controlled by “clans” (really more like gangs). Individuals who are registered with a clan receive protection and other advantages, in exchange for paying taxes (assessed at a Celebration). As power and wealth change hands, the relative position of the clans changes as well. Only the poorest are Unregistered; these are routinely abused by the clansmen. Generally the top three clans are considered “in power”, although the top clan is mostly in control. At the current time, the three major clans are

'''Blood Vat''': Originally formed by workers in the butcher trade, this clan is the largest and most powerful. They control the farmlands; their slaves work those fields. Led by Boss Hogg's adopted son Boss Borca, they are resented by much of the rest of the city for their arrogance and presumption…just as with all the prior “top clans”. Their symbol is a single drop of blood.

Boss Hogg himself was a huge dwarf (standing 5’10” and about 250 lbs). Although he looks fat, he is almost all muscle and despite his age is still powerful. He and his advisors are smarter than they look and are expert at playing the people’s emotions. Unlike most Bolorites, he does not get lost in bloodlust. His emotions are tightly under control and he wields them like weapons. Also unlike most (especially unlike the Xhortites), he has nothing against “regular” dwarves (the Betrayers, as they’re called). He’d have done the same to them. He respects power and victory. 

A deep anger simmers in him, however, barely visible to others. This anger was directed against his “advisors”, the pair of hags named Og’riq and Qyinoq. These ancient creatures are the source of the obsession with pain—they feed on the pain of the populace, fed through the fungal spores of a fey creature called “heartsease”, which have pervaded the atmosphere of Bolorhold. Unlike [[Gozh]], the Angels of Pain have very little desire to change much of anything—they’re content with their status. Hogg, like most of the Abandoned, hates the idea that they are playthings, prisoners, not in control. Yet he knows that if he tried to oppose the Angels of Pain he’d only sentence his whole people to agony and death as the heartsease dissipates. While he planned to deal with this (and has been tempering some of his elites against the fungus), he wasn't able move openly until the [[Wild Cards]] threw the status quo into chaos. Working with them, they were able to kill the Angels of Pain and purge the effect of the heartsease. This act ensured their dominance for the foreseeable future. In 240 AC, Boss Hogg retired from active leadership, letting his adopted son Borca handle the duties of Head Boss.

'''Dead Rats''': The former second rank clan (now fourth) was originally formed by sanitation and pest control workers. Now it mostly controls the city infrastructure. As such, it is very rich and powerful, but overconfident and stagnant. Their symbol is a rat head with “x” eyes. It has fallen considerably in the years since the fall of the Angels of Pain.

Boss Borcan is large and rough, but not nearly as large as Boss Hogg and much more overweight. An older dwarf, he has scars from fighting and one eye is grey. He swears like a sailor (every other word is vulgar). He loses himself to the bloodlust much more than the other bosses. He’s actually vulnerable to removal, but his 2nd-in-command is puppeting him subtly. Starting in 234 AC, this became open knowledge.

'''Whyos''': The third rank clan is unusual in that it is dominated by women (a comparative oddity in the power-based culture of the Abandoned). Started by those in the vice trades (prostitutes, gamblers, entertainers, etc), the Whyos still control most of the non-Celebration entertainment. Their symbol is a red lantern.

Boss “Lady Jane” is young by dwarven standards, and incredibly beautiful and sensual. She rarely wears much of anything and uses her beauty and sexuality to bend men to her will. Inside, she’s also very jaded and does not like anyone (her lovers are female, but only used as sex objects). Her bodyguards are large women.

Corcoran’s Roosters: the former fourth rank clan, now second after the effects of the [[Wild Cards]] has risen quickly (being ranked 10th 5 years ago). They control the outside market area, especially the non-Bolor portion. As a result, they profit off of the increased trade both with [[Zhapai Karmap]] and the lowland nations of the [[Federated Nations]]. This clan is the most accepting of change and of outsiders and the least bloodthirsty. Their symbol is a rooster’s comb. 

Boss Corcoran is a younger, snappily dressed dwarf. He presents as a harmless dandy in fine clothes and with exaggeratedly languid affect. He always carries a jeweled cane. In reality, he’s a sharp, lethal dueler and his cane is a sword in disguise. Likely the smartest of the major Bosses, he had his strong suspicions about the “advisors” but played the game. He protects his people because they are necessary for his ambitions.

===Nazorat, City of Domination===
Nazorat, the western city, is the smallest of the three at only about 5k. They are also the most closed-off. Even other Abandoned are restricted to a small area outside the city and non-Abandoned are not welcome.

Due to their insularity, not much is known. They were dominated by the [[mkhulu]] until they were liberated by the [[Wild Cards]] after the founding of [[Zhapai Karmap]]. It is notable that they still seem to have strange mental powers. They hire out as mercenary bands in secret but do not interact much with their clients. They specialize in infiltration and sabotage.

      <text bytes="7091" sha1="0l3tyyaswel62gz91hs353z6z5tp8y7" xml:space="preserve">The goroesi, commonly called dark elves, are a subrace mentioned only in the deepest records of the [[gwerin]] and dwarven peoples. Thought to have gone extinct at [[Moon's Fall]], about 4,000 years ago, a remnant survived in a time-warped bubble and re-emerged in the chaos of the [[Cataclysm]]. Now, in 250 AC, they are reaching out and will soon make contact with the members of the Federated Nations. Who are these wanderers from the ancient past? How will they alter the balance of power?

A few of them are known as the [[Seers]] of [[Godsfall]], but those were removed from their culture in their youth and do not know (or care) from whence they came. Another small population is rumored to exist in the [[Riftwall]] mountains of central [[Soefra]]--if they exist, they have few dealings with the surface cultures.

==Physical Description==
Goroesi are easily identified by their appearance. Their aelvar masters in ages past warped their ancestors with lasting wizardry, the results of which they bear on their skin and hair. Goroesi are of middling height for elves, standing 5'6" to 6'0" tall on average. Unlike the refined, elongated [[gwerin]] or the lithe, slender puun ihmisia, the goroesi are more solidly-built. They develop musculature more akin to that of a dwarf, and women tend to be amply endowed. Also unlike most elves, the males grow facial hair (although much less so than dwarves).

The most distinctive features are the goroesi's skin, hair, eyes, and ears. Their skin, the source of the common name, is dark grey, ranging from a light ash grey to an ink-black without trace of other color. Their skin tone is cool, with more blue than red. Their eyes, like those of the [[gwerin]], are jewel toned, but this color is uniform throughout the eyeball and their eyes lack visible pupils. Furthermore, their eyes have a faceted appearance, almost like an insect’s eyes. Sapphire blue and amethyst purple are the most common colors, but almost any pure jewel tone is found. Their hair is light and straight and has a metallic sheen. Usually metallic white or silver, but other shades are also not uncommon. Their ears, while pointed like those of the [[gwerin]], are longer and stick out at a large angle to their angular skulls. All told, a goroesi can only pass for a member of another race while hooded and gloved with no skin showing.

===Base Race Features===
{{boldList|Ability Score Increase|Goroesi have all survived in extremely harsh conditions. You gain +2 to your Constitution score.}}
{{boldList|Age| Like [[Puun Ihmisia|ihmisi]], goroesi live slightly longer than humans. They are adult around age 20 and live until around 100 years of age but show age only lightly.}}
{{boldList|Size|Goroesi are stockier than other elves and tend to stand about 5'6" in height. Goroesi women are slightly larger than men. Your size is Medium.}}
{{boldList|Speed|Your base walking speed is 30 ft.}}
{{boldList|Improved Darkvision|Centuries spent underground have led to a near-supernatural ability to see in the dark. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. Unlike most, you can discern color in darkness.}}
{{boldList|Underground Adaptation| You have an improved memory for underground areas. While underground, you cannot get lost and can always retrace your steps. Only teleportation or strong illusion or enchantment magic can override this.}}
{{boldList|Languages|You can speak, read, and write [[Yonwach]] (high elven) and [[Common]], although you have a strong accent with Common. Many, if not most, goroesi speak with archaic, elaborate syntax.}}

==Cultures==
The ancestors of the Noefran goroesi were at the epicenter of the disaster and escaped [[Moon's Fall]] via making a pact with [[Kel'dan]]. They swore themselves and their children through perpetuity to that Broken Concept. Once she was reborn as the [[Archon of Time]], the culture has fragmented. Some follow the orderly ways of the Archon; others keep to the chaotic ways of the Concept.

===Archonic===
The archonic are those that follow the new ways. Archonic culture has two touchstones--faith in the Seers and dedication to the ways of art and crafting. Those that create new things are valued; those that make ''beautiful'' new things are prized above all but the Seers. Seers are women (always chosen young) with a special connection to the Archon. They begin receiving visions around the time they enter puberty; these visions inevitably cause blindness. These visions are of things past, present, and future, all jumbled together. It is the special gift of a strong Seer to disentangle the threads of the visions and weave a coherent narrative. These Prophecies tend to be cryptic and uncertain, although those that affect the Seer's community directly are clearer and more obvious. Seers tend to go insane fairly quickly and get lost in the visions. The lingering effects of the Pact, plus the highly arcanely- and elementally-charged nature of their homeland tend to produce many sorcerers, wizards, and warlocks. They also are tied in with the nature of time and fate, and many have a small ability to manipulate the threads to prevent wild swings in fortune.

{{boldList|Ability Score Increase| Your choice of Intelligence or Charisma increases by 1.}}
{{boldList|Bonus Proficiencies| You gain proficiency with your choice of two artisan's tools or musical instruments.}}
{{boldList|Survivor of a Harsh Land|When you make a Wisdom (Survival) check to find shelter or track game, you count as being proficient and can add twice your proficiency bonus instead.}}
{{boldList|Archon's Blessing|When a creature within 30 feet of you makes an ability check, saving throw, or attack roll, you can use your reaction to instead replace the die result with 10. You can use this after you see the roll but before the result is applied. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.}}

===Broken===
The broken goroesi are those who splintered off of the archonic society and chose to keep to the old, wilder ways. They prize physical prowess and martial ability, hunting beasts and raiding. They no longer follow the main Seer collective; instead they choose budding seers and enhance their abilities via magic and drugs, giving them enhanced foresight at the cost of stability. Fiercely matriarchal, they keep males that cannot hunt as pets and servants.

{{boldList|Ability Score Increase|Your choice of Strength or Dexterity increases by 1.}}
{{boldList|Bonus Proficiencies|You gain proficiency with light armor and martial weapons.}}
{{boldList|Stalker's Grace You can make Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide while only concealed by dim light or half cover.}}
{{boldList|Kel'dan's Rejection|When a creature hits you or an ally you can see within 30 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to force them to reroll the attack and take the second result instead. Once you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.}}

      <text bytes="2284" sha1="4efarxy59tonjzhlfdnkjr2fkzj7ggs" xml:space="preserve">Now known as the Lady of Pain, the focus of the [[Barbed Circle]] cult, one of the five [[demon Princes]] that rule the nightmarish realm of the [[Abyss]], Lloitira was born an [[aelvar]] noble sometime during the middle of the Second Age. Along with the rest of her family, their names now lost to time, she partook in the Blood Rite and became one of the vampiric [[Nightlord]]s. For the next few centuries, she and her fellows ruled a portion of the aelvar empire through terrible pleasure and pain, feeding on the souls and emotions of their sapient cattle.

Unlike the rest of her kin, she survived the [[War of Blood]] that brought the reign of the [[Nightlord]]s to an end in fire and sword. She retreated into stasis for nearly a thousand years. Awoken by [[Oro-laen]] in the chaos surrounding [[Moon's Fall]], the two of them forged a pact against the world. They underwent the ritual of demonization, becoming the first of the demon princes and took up residence in the [[Abyss]], there to build demenses and cults that would torment and bedevil mortals for the rest of time.

It is whispered in the highest reaches of her cult, however, that this pact was not entirely self-centered. It is said that most of the power generated by her worship goes to building seals, patches against the [[Oblivion Gate]] and its influence. Such rumors are obviously false...

==Physical Appearance==
When she appears to others, Lloitira takes on whatever form she desires. Generally, this is of a humanoid female, beautiful beyond description. Viewers do not agree on much of her appearance, other than it causes pain due to the sheer beauty. One constant is that she is only clothed in fresh, glistening blood.

==Personality==
Lloitira is vain and cruel, but she is not stupid or brutal. Subtlety is one of her strengths, as is forward thought. Unlike the [[Red Fang]], she is not governed by her appetites (although they are not insignificant). She will generally keep her bargains, but all her bargains have poison thorns hidden in them.

She hates the [[Red Fang]], considering him brutal and vulgar. She has nothing but contempt for him and his cultists; this does not mean that they will not cooperate when it is useful to her plans.

      <text bytes="3047" sha1="1krotogskk087hjo3fkk9ssn7xv8qkv" xml:space="preserve">Along with [[Lloitira]], Oro-laen, also known as the Black Lord, is the oldest of the [[demon Princes|demon princes]] (other than the [[Broken Concept]]s of course). Technically, he is younger than she is, but he has been active for more time. Born an aelvar princeling about 500 years before [[Moon's Fall]], Oro-laen (not his original name) became one of the most powerful wizards the world has ever known. It is said that his was the hand and mind that developed the soul transfer ritual by which one can become a lich; it is also said that his original version was more powerful than the current version (just as the original [[Nightlord]]s make the current vampires look like pretenders and broken toys). Whatever the case, he transcended mortality and became a lich.

Having done that, having welcomed a [[jotnar]] into his soul, he looked into the [[Abyss]] and saw the truth of the [[Oblivion Gate]] at its heart, seeing that the residents of the [[Abyss]] were an imperfect patch on that gaping wound. He vowed then to find a better way. Out of hubris, maybe, but every effort since then has been devoted to finding a way to seal the dread gate forever. That was why he, along with [[Lloitira]] became demons--to place themselves between the gate and the mortal world, to fight oblivion with oblivion. No means is too foul, no sacrifice too great. Except loss of personal honor--this vow is all that gives him strength to resist the [[jotnar]]'s hunger. As a result, he will not break his word once given. His contracts are twisty and often more than they appear, but they are always fulfillable and he will never go back on his word.

This pact makes Oro-laen the most approachable of the demon princes, and simultaneously one of the least attractive to make pacts with. He will not countenance betrayal (just ask the [[Dark Lady]]), and has no problem working with "heroic" adventurers to destroy those that pose a danger. His cult, while it engages in necromancy and black magic, also is one of the more controlled--it teaches that practitioners of necromancy must maintain control at all times and not let their servants prey on innocent lives (more out of practicality to avoid crusading heroes, but...)

==Physical Appearance==
Oro-laen appears as an elven wizard of no particular beauty or refinement. His robes are always spotless and pressed--that is his one vanity. But those who have beheld him all agree that his eyes are his most striking feature. To look into them is to stare into the Abyss itself, to watch the [[Oblivion Gate]] that writhes at its heart. Certainly a disconcerting experience even for the strongest soul.

==Personality==
Oro-laen is dour, with little passion or emotion. He does employ dry humor. He never raises his voice or shows anger. Honor is everything--those that keep their word are favored. Those that do not are destroyed. He does not have patience for foolishness--those that seek him out are advised to be thoroughly prepared and to the point.

      <text bytes="4692" sha1="9imttl69xuwitqc82g9n18ukm7fg8nv" xml:space="preserve">Quest seeds are the starting point for campaigns. Think of them like "main quests" in various video games. Unlike video games, they do often come with a ticking clock. Success isn't the end of the campaign--merely the end of an arc. And you can choose to abandon the arc at any point and go somewhere else. But remember--Dawn of Hope is a persistent-world setting. The things you do (or don't do) have effects that last and will affect other campaigns in the same setting! While there are other adventurers who may attempt the unchosen quests, their performance and their choices are somewhat random. Choose your quests wisely!

Quest seeds are arranged by area and by starting level. For most parties, especially of new players, I recommend one of the level 1 seeds. Experienced parties can start at the level 3 ones; going higher requires having characters with established reputations as adventurers of note.

==Fiach Wood==
The [[Fiach Wood]] is the sea of trees that covers the land north of [[Lake Coy'in]] and east of the [[Nocthian Caldera]]. Home to [[Orcs|orc]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ish tribes and a few [[Puun Ihmisia|puun ihmisi]] tribes, it houses many untouched ruins.

===Ruins of Ages Past===
;Location: [[Fiach Wood]], north east of [[Wyrmhold]]
;Levels: 1+
;Description: An expedition is being assembled to find the ruins of the pre-[[Cataclysm]] cities that once were in what is now the [[Fiach Wood]]. Join for treasure and discovery of the past.
;Pillars: Combat ~ Exploration ~ Social
;Terrain: Forests, hills, mountains
;Adventuring Company: [[Dragonslayers]], [[Guardians of the Forgotten]], or [[Imperial Legacy]]
;In-universe Time: Early summer 251 AC

==Uulan Confederacy/Outer Barrier Range==
The [[Uulan Confederacy]] is a dwarven-dominated nation to the east of the [[Sea of Grass]], mostly in and buried under the [[Outer Barrier Range]]. To the south across the mountains are wastelands, eventually leading into [[Moon's Fall Vengeance]], a peninsula of broken glass and arcane magic run wild.

===Forging a New Order===
;Location: [[Sea of Grass]], [[Outer Barrier Range]], and [[Uulan Confederacy]]. 
;Levels: 1+
;Description: The run from [[Rauviz]] to [[Fuar Uulan]] is one of the most boring, well-traveled routes in all the [[Federated Nations]]. So why is a well-known dwarven clan hiring adventurers to make that run...and why hasn't anyone else accepted it?
;Pillars: Combat ~ Exploration ~ Social
;Terrain: Plains, Underground, badlands
;Adventuring Company: [[Ironshroud]], [[Guardians of the Forgotten]], [[Selan's Seekers]] or [[Imperial Legacy]]
;In-universe Time: Late summer 251 AC.

== Nocthian Caldera ==
The [[Nocthian Caldera]] is a vast remnant of an ancient supervolcano, now a high plain to the west of [[Wyrmhold]]. Before the [[Cataclysm]] it was the home of the worshipers of [[Nocthis]] as well as the early [[dragonborn]] nation; after the Nocthians left the [[Hungering Frost]] moved in and kicked out the dragonborn. Once that was defeated about 40 years ago, it's been the site of expansion from both [[Wyrmhold]] and [[Byssia]] (the inheritors of the Nocthian legacy). But the remnants of the [[Hungering Frost]]'s army still lingers there, as well as buried weapons and ruins of the Third Age.

=== Goblins! ===

;Location
: Northern [[Nocthian Caldera]]
;Levels: 1+
;Description: A small [[Wyrmhold|Wyrmholder]] border outpost is requesting additional aid to figure out why a band of goblins keeps making nuisance-level, completely ineffectual raids against the outpost. No one's been hurt, and the outpost doesn't want to risk an international incident by calling in the military. Especially at a politically sensitive time like this.
;Pillars: Combat ~ Exploration ~ Social
;Terrain: Plains, mountains
;In-universe Time: Mid summer 251 AC.

== Crisial Kingdom/Sundown Hills ==
The [[Sundown Hills]] is the local name for the range of grassy, rolling hills that range the southern border of the [[Crisial Kingdom]]. The only major town is [[Honel]], and the major exports are various stones and ores mined from the hills. The people are generally averse to central authority--the area is dotted with small villages that have limited contact with the outside world

=== Wouldn't be Caught Dead ===

;Location
: The Greenwood Valley, NNE of [[Adair]], a small village south-east of [[Honel]] along the Bor river.
;Levels: 1+
;Description: A request for aid has come from the village of Adlarnis. They're reporting issues with undead activity. So far no damage, but sightings of zombified figures in the woods.

      <text bytes="1483" sha1="m2w5mxvbo3xot8arem3qf0hzctvhp3s" xml:space="preserve">Once an angelic blade belonging to a planetar-class angel known as Dezhuura. Used to slay Dezhuura's lover Viltis when she believed that Viltis had betrayed their god, it sat in the corpse for over two centuries. When Viltis and Dezhuura were redeemed and became [[The Redeeming Blades]], they discarded the blade as tying them to the past. It passed into [[shadow]] and become an intelligent weapon and patron of warlocks.

==Pact==
Redemption makes the pact of the hexblade with seekers. It seeks out those who need strength to protect others and those working in worthy causes and offers strength in return for service. Redemption asks of its clients that they give of self to keep others from making mistakes and to protect those that cannot. It has an especial hatred of deception and lies.

It will abandon those that seek power for themselves or who use their power to oppress the weak.

==Ethics==

Redemption is Lawful Guilt-tripping. It believes in bright-line rules and gets after those who break those laws. It really doesn't like ambiguity or "nuance", preferring to cut through the fog of words to the heart of the matter. It will never lie by omission or commission.

==Power==
Redemption is one of the weaker patrons. It is currently wielded by a paladin who, in life, served in the [[Sinner's Tear]]. It only has a few dozen clients, but is working to build up a network of agents. Its strongest contacts are with the [[Sinner's Tear]].

60 miles NNW from [[Cragdale]] and 60 miles SW of [[True Hold]]. Connected to the [[Sea of Grass]] via three passes: [[Hope's End Pass]] (elevation 300 ft), [[Brown Bear Pass]] (elevation 450 ft), and [[Hope's Pass]] (elevation 350 ft).

==History==
Established in 220 AC by Aedron Laav-Gan, who believed that pre-Cataclysm ruins in the area were of a lost dwarven gold mine. The mines were never found and Aedron quickly went broke. The village turned to fishing and farming along the shore of the [[Sea of Dreams]]. In recent years, Lord Sumpter, a young count with delusions of mercantile grandeur bought the local patent nobility and has been hard at work converting it into a port town, attempting to break [[True Hold]]'s grip on cross-Sea trade from [[Shinevog]] and [[Zhapai Karmap]].

The northernmost river of the [[Sea of Grass]], it enters [[Lake Coy'in]] just north of [[Rauviz City]]. It is navigable by ships for almost the entire length from [[Cragdale]] south, making it an expanding trade route. A significant amount of the [[Rauviz]]-[[Godsfall]] trade goes downriver from [[Sheplyn]] as well as around the coast from [[Rabbiton]].

The Avon-Pact is 50-100 feet wide across most of its length and runs quite swiftly and cold.

      <text bytes="8770" sha1="nnw8zkflwoi454t7buuwbujqh0dsiud" xml:space="preserve">The Breath of the Sun is an organization of militants dedicated to [[Tor Elan]] as the Burning Sun. They focus on his aspect as Lord of Battles. Those that serve here live, fight, and die in the name of the Sun Lord. The center of this cult is the [[Dawnspire]] in the mountains above [[Lyodnoir]].

==Hierarchy==

===Leaders===
These are of equal standing, although different in role

;Ecclesiarch: Chosen from the ranks of the clerics by [[Tor Elan]] as his word, the Ecclesiarch is the leader of the Breath of the Sun. The current Ecclesiarch is [[Horus Manus]].
;Praecentor of Penance: Chosen from the ranks of paladins and priests, he represents the spiritual and martial arms, focusing inward to the Ecclesiarch's outward orientation. The current Praecentor is [[Ezykiel]] of [[Anu]], called Sinderman (Coal-bearer).

===Priestly Ranks : Number===
# Cardinal : 4 
# Deacon : 16
# Abbot : 64
# Priest : 256
# Acolyte (trainee) : ~500

Of these, the Ecclesiarch, Praecentor, one of the cardinals, two deacons, 4 abbots, and 16 priests are assigned to the [[Dawnspire]]. The acolytes spend some of their time there--the number present at any time is between 40 and 80. There are also support personnel who are not directly members of the Ecclesia, as well as the shrouded sages, oathsworn, and clerics. The latter two categories rarely spend much time at the [[Dawnspire]], although they visit for the High Holy Day in mid-summer and when they are needed to report to the Ecclesia and receive new assignments or other duties.

Each of the cardinals has responsibility over the organization's efforts in a particular area of the world. Each of the four Orders in each cardinal's area is headed by a deacon. Abbots and their staffs handle most of the day-to-day concerns of the Breath of the Sun, overseeing the efforts of priests in the field.

===Regions of Operation===
The world has been divided into four "regions" or "spheres", and one cardinal assigned to each one. In theory all spheres are equal, but in practice the ranking is as follows:
# Cardinal of the Spire -- responsible for the functioning of the [[Dawnspire]] and its associated works. This post is currently occupied by [[Ignace Oliten]].
# Cardinal of Lyodanoir and Safehold -- responsible for the operations of the church throughout central Wyrmhold. Its seat is occupied by [[Eugene Temba]] (gro'Tabar).
# Cardinal of Wyrmhold -- responsible for operations throughout the rest of Wyrmhold and the [[Nocthian Caldera]]. Occupied by [[Kor Phaeron]] (gro'Skem).
# Cardinal to the Nations -- responsible for operations throughout the rest of the world (although so far the church has not spread much outside the [[Federated Nations]] and is rather sparse outside of Wyrmhold itself. This seat is occupied by [[Maloghust]].

===Orders===
The four orders are
* Teleos -- those responsible for the physical wellbeing of the church. Logistics.
* Anima -- those responsible for the spiritual wellbeing of the church. Preachers.
* Magistratus -- those responsible for training acolytes and warriors. Teachers/drill masters.
* Scientias -- those responsible for information gathering and collation. Clerks.

===Other Ranks===
;Shrouded Sage: Equal in rank to a deacon, but dedicated to studying the changes in the world, and keeping records. They keep their identities hidden after they take their oath, typically live in a cloistered section below the [[Dawnspire]]. They are always wizards that were chosen from the acolytes that display more talent for the arcane than for the divine. As of 250 AC, there are only 14 active sages, with a few in training.

; Oathsworn: At least equal in rank to an abbot, but can be ranked higher. These are the heads of the martial arm and frequently take Oath as paladins. Praecentors of Penance are most frequently chosen from their ranks as the predecessor retires or passes on. There are 58 currently active oathsworn, with approximately 30 squires and 15 retired (usually for medical reasons) members.

; Clerics : These act outside the hierarchy, though they answer to the Ecclesiarch directly. The next Ecclesiarch is always chosen from the clerics. They cannot command the priests, but the priesthood generally listens when the clerics take a strong stance. The smallest of the arms, there are only 32 active clerics of all categories.

==Description==
Every part of the lives of the members of the order, whatever rank they are in the hierarchy, is spent in service to [[Tor Elan]]. Every night the temple is ritually cleansed, same with the weapons and armor that were used that day. By tradition, every member present participates in this, from the Ecclesiarch to the rawest acolytes.

Training acolytes that wish to become clerics or paladins involves brutal ritual combat that can and often does result in death. But the dead are treated as one who has fallen in [[Tor Elan]]'s name, so their name is etched into the outer walls. And many are rejected because they don't have the necessary divine potential--they usually end up in the priestly orders.

==Members of Note==
Other than the hierarchy:

Leon Corax - Orc. Head of the Magistratus within the Dawnspire, one of the few Oathsworn. Known and feared as the Drill Sergeant by the acolytes, his inside isn't as frosty as his exterior.

Nero Thargost - Hobgoblin. Quick to anger with a fierce fighting style. Wants nothing more than to become an Oathsworn, however is struggling to connect with the spiritual side. Has only lost to one individual since becoming an acolyte. Compensates for a lack of true connection by being more zealous than the zealots. Often quite closed-minded and proud. 

Grimaldus Ansgar - A human in his early 50s. Brother to Sigismund. Resident cleric. Was called back to the temple in 248 AC and is in training to replace Horus as the next Ecclesiarch. A master strategist, he is considered unparalleled in defensive tactics in the region of [[Wyrmhold]]. Much more of a radical than is the Ecclesiarch.

Sigismund Ansgar- A human in his late 50s. Brother to Grimaldus. Retired Oathsworn. Serves as the deacon of Teleos in the Spire. Believed to be the next Praecentor of penance should something happen to the current docedent. Like his brother, he is considered a master strategist. He, however, is viewed as a master in offensive tactics. there are those who say that a war between Grimaldus and Sigismund would never end, as it would be akin to an immovable object facing an unstoppable force. One of the most radical of the leadership, believing that the [[Breath of the Sun]] should take command of [[Wyrmhold]] and lead it to glory.

Merek Jurisian - Master of the forge for the [[Dawnspire]]. For a dwarf, he is massively built. Looks much younger than he is with a grey and brown beard, often looks almost black from the soot and smoke. His face and right side of his head is covered with terrible burns that disfigured him ages ago, and thus is blind in one of the eyes. Along with overseeing much of the armaments that are made within the holy forge of the [[Dawnspire]], he also oversees the automatons that are assigned to the forge, of which there are now only two. He is viewed as joyous and kind, with strong familial bonds. He often sings while forging the special blades for higher ranking members of the breath of the sun. He believes that the songs he sings give the weapons direction, allowing their spirits to know what their purpose is. One of the rare dwarves to never drink. While not part of the hierarchy, he is a devout believer and is well respected by the members of the order.

==Beliefs==
The core tenets of the [[Breath of the Sun]] are
; The Sun is Supreme : [[Tor Elan]] is the supreme leader of the [[Congregation]] and should be worshiped as such. Other gods have their roles, but all must acknowledge the burning might of the sun, which scorches evildoers and brings life to the righteous.
; Bring Light to the Darkness : As the sun's light banishes physical darkness, so the Breath of the Sun should root out corruption, demonic worship, necromancy, and all other forms of unrighteousness.
; The Sun Gives Strength to Those Who Fight for Righteousness : Life is a struggle. And for those called to be the Breath of the Sun, the struggle is not figurative. Members should fight with all their might against evil, against creatures or organizations that threaten the weak.
; The Sun Will Rise : Just as the sun's rising is unstoppable, so must the march of those that serve the Burning Sun. Let nothing stand in the way of the cause of the [[Breath of the Sun]].
; To Each His Measure : The strongest should face the strongest threats, leaving the weaker threats for the weaker servants.

At 450' above sea level, it is actually the easiest of the passes because the valleys on either side don't fall off as much (only about 150 feet on average). It was named for the large number of...well...bears that the early pioneers noticed.

      <text bytes="6681" sha1="phxh9946ayo421d0ll36lgzyxsgrwj9" xml:space="preserve">An artificial monarchy/aristocracy. The founding families, wandering after the destruction of the [[Cataclysm]], found an ancient library in a ruined castle. Sick and tired of the destruction, with the ties to nature cut off, they became fascinated with the pre-Cataclysm fictional romances. They painted a picture of a feudal kingdom with brave knights, loyal retainers, dashing adventures, beautiful women and tear-jerking romantic complications. So they set out to create that kingdom in truth.

About 15 years later, remnants of the original Meztlan population sought refuge in the area. The Auringon elves gave them refuge, in exchange for working the land and playing the role of serfs, servants, and yeomen.  Starving, they accepted.

Their top priority was to teach everyone the distorted truth and to inculcate obedience to this planned society. Doing this required help. The First Families used an artifact in the ruined castle to manipulate the memories of and lives of everyone in the kingdom...at a cost. They sacrificed their people's vitality, decreasing their lifespans to those of normal humans and cutting themselves off from nature. So now they're basically humans with pointy ears and a few other traits.

[[File:Auringon.webp|frameless|600x600px]]

==Government==
===Royal House/Duchy Aurin===
Auringon is ruled by a king, Aurel III, grandson of the first King. Now an elderly (~75) man himself, he has played his part well. Also Duke of Aurin. Physically infirm (although the intervention of the [[Heroes Foretold]] has drastically improved his health by ending a slow poisoning). His wife Queen Tatya (his 3rd wife, as the first two died in childbirth) is much younger (~18), and a bit of a flibbertigibbet at least on the surface. Very beautiful and beloved by her people.

He has two living children (with two who have died). His eldest daughter is, Lady Sophrenia. She's 50, has never married and serves as the king's mage and the head of the Mage's College. His youngest daughter is Lady-Priestess Yelena. Aged 25, she's the daughter of the 2nd wife and the kings' favorite. She serves as High Priestess of the [[Aerielara | Lady of Jewels]]. She's a total slut and a schemer, although most of her schemes revolve around her...conquests. His heir is actually his eldest grandchild, Prince Alan (age 19). Alan's father, Prince Axel (Aurel's firstborn), died in a drunken accident about 2 years ago. Alan is vain and not very bright, although the exposure of Duke Avignon's treachery has brought him to his senses a bit.

Each of the 4 other duchies are ruled by a Duke. Some duchies have counties or earldoms.

===Duchy Yvore===
The Dowager Dutchess Yvore is actually in charge; the duke is her 4-year-old son. They abolished serfdom even before the [[Heroes Foretold]] shook things up in 250 AC. A large number of the meztlan refugees from the most recent crisis have settled there. Yvore has two divisions: Yvore County and Northford County.

; Dowager Dutchess Yvore : widowed young (32). Technically an advisor, Regent Hawthorne rules for son, but is patsy. Does not trust mages. Friendly towards the [[Federated Nations]].
; Count Northford : Veteran knight, no ambitions.
; Lord Hero Gabriel : One of the [[Heroes Foretold]], Gabriel has married into House Yvore and been granted an estate in Yvore County.

===Duchy Troyes===
Smallest and newest duchy, Troyes was only founded in 220 AC. The bulk of the meztlan refugees settled here and are transforming it into a bustling area. Like Yvore, Troyes has abandoned serfdom.
; Duke Troyes : Poor except in land. Looking for workers, but can't pay. Laws prevent him from offering freeholds to outsiders. Fully in favor of the [[Federated Nations]].
; Baron Saint-Germaine : Rules over eastern marches. Paranoid a bit.

===Duchy Avignon===
The oldest dutchy (beyond Aurin itself). Directly in the path of the refugees, they bore the brunt of the impact. Avignon has very few freemen, mostly serfs. Currently in bad odor, as the prior Duke was revealed to be a traitor conspiring to poison the king.  The counties are Avignon County and Colmar County. Colmar has also recently changed leadership, as the former Count Colmar was Avignon's henchman and also traitor.

; (Former) Duke Bors Avignon : Grasping, arrogant, scheming. Pretends to be traditional, but really wants to take power. Was poisoning the king via [[Tlalocana]]-provided parasite. Killed in the Trials of the [[Heroes Foretold]]. Father of Queen Tatya, although she despised him. 
; (Former) Count Jared Colmar : Brute. On his 6th wife (he likes them young and broken). A part of the plot to take over the kingdom, he was also killed in the Trials of the [[Heroes Foretold]] and is missed by exactly no one.
; Duke Sorel Avignon : A weak man, spared the purges after his uncle's betrayal only because he was too obviously spineless to take part. Very devout, very not bright. Totally under the thumb of Queen Tatya.

===Duchy Vitre===
Considered back-country. Very loyal and traditional. Two counties: Vitre County and Laon County.
; Duke Emmanuel Vitre : Older, traditional. Hates politics. Very loyal to royal family. Will do whatever the royal family says.
; Count Illyas Laon : Super-religious.

==Other People==
; (Former) High Priest of Crowns Roland: Ambitious man. Uses Laon &amp; Yvore as patsies. Deposed by Hero Priest Yosef, who currently reigns in the temple of [[Roel Kor]]. Roland is currently serving in a small chapel on the southern border.

==Recent Changes==
In mid summer 250 AC, the [[Heroes Foretold]] arrived as part of a [[Dashingwell]]-sponsored diplomatic mission from the [[Federated Nations]] to Auringon. They uncovered Duke Avignon's treachery and the threat from [[Tlalocana]]. They also brought an end to the Tale by passing the Test of the [[Elder Library]] and closing the Tome. In the aftermath, they've settled down here and started to prepare the nation against the oncoming [[Tlalocana]]n armies.

As part of this, two groups of refugees from the south were incorporated into Avignon. They are the [[meztlan]] and [[Meztlan|K'ijn]] peoples. The [[Meztlan|uacmin]] were denied entry and are actively hunted when they raid. The meztlan have settled in the most, while the k'ijn largely went north and east around Auringon.

In 252 AC, [[Ad Elementis]] came to town. They ended up settling in the southern Avignon Duchy, with [[Wan Tian Kuo]] marrying [[Yelena of Auringon]], who retired as high-priestess of [[Aerielara]] after she got pregnant with his baby. [[Pyrrha Kelshanne]] and [[Eskel]] married and settled nearby, opening a druid grove and mage tower.

An [[ihmisi]] druid, Corran was raised in the [[Council Lands]]. His family had a legend that they were descended from ancient mages and had a token bearing old imperial runes as evidence. When he came of age, Corran set off to prove this legacy. He discovered [[Imperial Research Alpha]], returned from its journey outside of time and space and took control. Always obsessed with dragons, his obsession took on sexual overtones as he attempted to use the facility to breed/create for himself a harem of half-dragon females. In this he was thwarted by two adventurers in 211 AC and the facility was destroyed completely.

His surviving legacy is the creation of the [[ryuukin]] race using the same technologies that created the [[dragonborn]] in centuries past, although using gnomes as the base material.

Unlike the rest of the city, the outer wards failed in this sector very early. Called "Green" both because it was swallowed by forest (leaving little if any trace of the prior city) and because it was considered "safe" from the demons and undead that lived in the remainder of the warded area. It is the home of the [[Watching Eye]] and they have successfully focused the rebuilding elsewhere, leaving this area mostly wild (although carefully protected from wild animals that could injure people.

Especially [[Godsfall]]--they took on the duty of patrolling the ward lines to prevent the failure of more wards and the escape of denizens (or the ingress of those that would loot).

After the liberation of Godsfall in 212 AC, they widened their gaze to the rest of the ruins all over [[Kotimaa]]. Never a large tribe, they recruited others (especially working with the [[Society for the Preservation of Antiquities]]) and formed [[Guardians of the Forgotten]]. First as a general purpose organization, then transitioning it to one of the [[Registered Companies]] once that was formalized. They provide the magical backup, focusing on the shamanistic and elemental arts over the pure arcane or divine.

Currently the tribe numbers 183 individuals.

Of the elemental rulers, he is the only one of the originals left, the others having become gods ([[Korokonolkom]]) or having become demigods ([[Perkunos]] and [[Tatsuryuu]]). A being of Law (unlike almost every other wyrm), he believes in the law of power above all. He is the most powerful, so he sets the rules. All others obey or suffer.

== Creed ==

* Power is the only truth, the only freedom.
* The powerful do not fear conflict; they glory in the flame
* The weak require protection from the strong. They pay for that protection with obedience.

== Supporting Cult ==
His message and power is supported by the [[Cult of Burning Law]], an organization of [[Plane-touched|fire-born]], [[Plane-bound|lava-bound]], and [[named]] individuals who operate out of the capital of the [[Plane of Lava]], [[Nara Kara]]. They enforce his dictates (as voiced by the Masked Judges) and mediate disputes (including acting as judges for trial by combat). Although Alastor himself is tied to the elemental plane, many of his cultists believe that they have an obligation to spread his influence everywhere (in keeping with the theme of volcanic inexorability).

Originally constructed in ages past by the Nocthian civilization, then sealed until the exodus of the Nocthians from the Caldera in the years after the [[Cataclysm]]. Parts of it were intentionally collapsed (especially the caldera-side entrance) behind the final parties.

Re-excavated and reinforced starting in 212 AC, the tunnel now serves as the main [[Byssia]]n entry point into the Caldera.

==Dimensions==
Winding nearly 100 miles through caverns natural and artificial and containing nearly 10,000 steps and mechanical elevators of ancient design, the Tunnel of the Ancestors is the largest such construct in [[Noefra]]. Constant patrols keep the creatures that infested it after it was abandoned at bay, although travel through the tunnel is still not entirely considered safe and parties making the trip are encouraged to bring significant protection.

Approximately half-way through is [[Moonlight]], an underground city catering to travelers and explorers.

The jotnari (yot-NAR-i, singular jotnar, YOT-nar) are beings from beyond the [[Dark Beyond]]. They are anti-life, essences of non-being. Immaterial and indestructible, they enter the Dream through the [[Oblivion Gate]] and well up out of the [[Abyss]] whenever that realm comes in contact with the other planes. In a way, the [[abyss]] is a prison for the [[jotnar]]i. It is believed among the Wise that the betrayal of the [[Nameless]] either caused or was caused by these beings of infinite hunger. Whatever the truth, it is known that the [[Oblivion Gate]] was not in the original design for the universe, and that only the presence of the prisoners of the [[abyss]] in that realm acts as a buffer against the jotnari.

Both [[undead]] and [[demons]] owe their existence to the jotnar. The first are dead bodies, animated and given a semblance of life by summoning a jotnar into the corpse. As such, they drain the life out of all around them just by their existence. The latter are living beings who play host to a jotnar, feeding it souls lest it devour their own soul and gaining power from that act. They trade their humanity for eternal life...until the jotnar inside of them consumes them as well. Mourn them, brothers, for their sacrifice delays the ending of this world.

This roughly-spherical mass of indeterminate size (for it swells and shrinks; no two observers can agree on its size) is a living wound in the fabric of the Dream, the cancer from which the [[jotnar]]i spring. Its spores, they carry destruction and entropy into all things. It is said that any entity that touches or is touched by the Gate, no matter how slight the contact, ceases to exist, devoured by that ''thing'', although ''absence of thing-ness'' might be a better, although clumsier phrase. It is also said that it reaches out tendrils of itself and that to get too close is to be drawn inexorably closer until one is destroyed.

Some claim that the Gate itself is an entity with thoughts and identity, albeit alien and incomprehensible to others. Others see it as an insensate force of anti-nature, entropy personified. Some claim that the matter it destroys is simply gone; others (especially [[Nidus]] claim that the Gate is ''deconstructing'' the matter, learning from it, absorbing whatever capabilities it possesed, and becoming more "intelligent" with everything it absorbs.

Among these peaks and within these valleys, the [[kami]] still hold sway, as do the druids and elemental shamans who speak for them.

Mostly reclaimed swampland-turned-rice-paddies, the dominant feature of the Lowlands is the Great Byssian Canal and its branches.

Every village pays yearly tribute, mostly in manpower but also in supplies and money which is dedicated to the Canal.

The only major feature is the [[Isle of Beasts|Island of Beasts]], a mountainous island said to be inhabited by all manner of ferocious creatures and sacred to [[Lae Loara]].
[[File:Gaptoothbay-10.png|center|thumb|800x800px|Gap-tooth Bay ca 250 AC]]

=== Locations ===

* The only nation confirmed (as of 250 AC) to border the bay is [[Byssia]] to the north.
* The [[Isle of Beasts]] is the large island in the south-central portion of the bay. Rising several thousand feet above the waterline, the mountain there is said to be inhabited by fantastic beasts.
* The Veldt is the sparsely-inhabited region between [[Byssia]] and the [[Auringon]] territory. Rolling plains, with a few bits of settlers both human and ihmisi.
* The [[Westerly Islands]] are a large group of islands of various sizes located SE of the Veldt. Inhabited by outsider-distrusting native groups who worship the sea and the spirits.
* The Green Line is a band of sea vegetation that blocks most of the access to the [[Primal Sea]]. Scattered among the clinging vegetation are sharp rocks and reefs, making passage nearly impossible.
* The Teeth are a group of reefs and sharp rocks that close the eastern side of the passage. They're known to shift and move, almost as if controlled by a malign will.
* Southmount is the low mountains that form the border between Byssia and the Bloodthirst. Home of primal spirits of rock and earth, still annoyed by the (now 45 year gone) presence of the [[Twisted]]'s corruption in the wildlands
* Beyond the dotted line is Terra Incognita. None of the inhabitants of the [[Federated Nations]] know more than rumors about what lies there, at least until you get far enough east to reach the waters owned by the [[Serpent Dominion]].
* Pearl Islands. A group of islands known for producing the best pearls. Not part of Byssia, but trade via #3.

=== Numbered Locations ===

# Farport. The blue-water port, last port of call of Byssian territory to the SE. Known for being a surly, independent lot.
# Spice Islands
# Home Islands. Part of Byssia, fishermen mostly.
# The Claw.
# Pirate lands? There are pirates, to be sure. But no one knows where the port is.
# [[Freeport]]. A brand new port, attempting to open up the wildlands. Not formally part of Byssia. Owned by a trade faction. Very small.

==Prelude==
After the Aurum family took the imperial throne in 997 BC through assassination, the decay of the moral fabric of the empire accelerated. The weak Aurum rulers, more concerned with parties and flashy displays than actually ruling, were unable to prevent the drawing-apart of the provinces. In addition, the demonic-prompted research into [[Blood Magic|blood magic]], into using souls as fuel and grafting souls onto others to create artificial life was allowed to run without check. Slavery, once banned in the Empire, was re-established. First as a punishment for debt, then wholesale. Any form of justice for noble crimes diminished outside of a few remote provinces.

==The Last Straw==
When the [[dragonborn]] were unveiled as the core of the new Imperial Army in 800 BC, the revulsion to the method of their creation was widespread. On the occasion of the marriage of Emperor Aurum XVI to his 12th wife (a girl of 10 years), three members of the emperor's Oathguard and 24 others sacrificed themselves to detonate the largest [[concept bomb]] ever. It removed a 14-mile-radius sphere encompassing the entire Imperial capital from existence, along with the entire Imperial Senate (except 5 members) and all but two of the imperial family.

==War==
The resulting chaos spread quickly. Province against province, city against city. Histories of exactly who the factions were or about the battles have mostly been lost--the use of [[concept bomb]]s was commonplace and much of the landscape has changed. Sporadic bouts of war lasted nearly 200 years. Areas would be at peace for generations, then suffer a spasm of war. Overall, tens of millions of lives were lost and the [[demons]] feasted.

==Aftermath==
In the wake of the War of Souls, the central region of the empire was almost entirely depopulated. Civilization only survived around the edges. It took 600 years to rebuild, and technology never reached the same heights.

Now has become a major trade stop on the route to the [[Sea of Grass]]. Notable for the Greenscale Distillery, which produces some of the finest liquor in the [[Federated Nations]] (and is run by [[ryuukin]]).

Was the launching place for the [[Tooth and Spell (Campaign)]].

==Historical Map (210 AC)==
[[File:srassa_saat.png|600px|Srassa Saat, ca 211 AC]]

==Current Map and Information==
[[File:Srassa saat (252).webp|thumb|Srassa Saat ca 252 AC]]
As of 252 AC, the town of Srassa Saat has grown to a population of approximately 1200 people...not counting the now hundreds of [[ryuukin]] who live in burrows and tunnels under the Greenscale Distillery or the 500 soldiers permanently stationed there (especially after the [[Winter War]]). It boasts one of the larger garrisons for the former Northern District, as it is the northernmost significant settlement of that nation and bears responsibility for protecting the entire region and the borders.

Its economy is mostly fishing and agriculture, but most of the monetary income comes from the Greenscale Distillery, which produces various high-potency and high-quality distilled alcohols in substantial quantity.

=== Amenities ===

# There is a large Temple of the [[Queen Ascendant]] here, boasting a priestess who is capable of casting 5th-circle spells, including the ability (if paid appropriately) to raise the dead.
# The market here has a mix of northern and southern goods.
# The distillery sells its second-run liquor and beer here for very little.

Once called the Forbidden Land, it was designated as such by the Powers after the [[Dawn War]] as it was the place of imprisonment and slumber for four living weapons of the [[Nameless]] during that war. Judgement was passed in 212 AC by the [[Airship Pioneers]] and three of the four were set free, on condition that they cause no harm outside the continent. Since then, a small settlement of creatures unique to the continent (the effects of [[Zhigor]]'s presence) has arisen at a town they call Freedom. A contingent of [[jazuu]] explorers from [[Oelfra]] have landed at the northern edge, a place they call [[Titan Landing]].

==Places==
; Anzu's Rest : This mountain was once the form of [[Anzu]], Stormbringer. When it was freed, it left behind a much reduced peak. The area around here is known for unpredictable winds.
; [[Zhigor]] : The ancient, colossal dragon-turtle has settled down here for a nap. That nap might last millennia. The area around here is extremely fertile, with hybrid plants and animals springing up constantly. In late winter 251 AC, Zhigor relocated to [[Soefra]] as part of [[Tempus Machina]]'s fight against the [[Adversary]]. He's currently located there.
; Temple of Chains : This was the place of imprisonment of [[Echidra]], Mother of Monsters. She still can be beseeched here by the daring.
; Behemoth's Prison : This ravenous beast is the only one still imprisoned, here in the heart of an ancient, active super-volcano. The churning lava keeps it contained, as even Behemoth's regeneration can only partially mend the damage.

This transformation was not of her own will, but she and her children wreaked havoc during that age-old conflict. After the war, she and three of her brood were imprisoned on [[Aenimos]] by the Powers on the testimony of her fourth child, the being now known as the [[Twisted]].

Her aspect is Creation; bringing all things into existence.

==Shape==
In her Mortal-plane form, Echidra is a multi-headed dragon-hydra hybrid, without wings. She has 7 heads, of which the central is the primary. She stands more than 40' tall at the shoulders and approximately 100' long if she stretches out.

==Children==
She had four major children, one for each element.
* [[Anzu]], Stormbringer, is a tremendous roc with mile-wide wings. He represents air, freedom, and change.
* [[Behemoth]], Devourer, is a lizard-like creature with destructive breath and enormous regeneration powers. And unquenchable hunger. He was the only one ''not'' freed, as his only desire is to destroy and consume. Represents fire, destruction, and hunger.
* The [[Twisted]], Demon Prince and traitor. This mega-kraken betrayed the others, allowing their capture. Also slandered them as ravening monsters, leading to their imprisonment. Later became one of the [[Demon Princes]]. Represented water, patience, and memory.
* [[Zhigor]], Lifebringer, is a gigantic turtle/lizard hybrid with a shell more than a mile across and bearing a small forest. Mostly sleeps, but his presence grants fertility and life to everything around it. Responsible for several new species, including an intelligent one. Represents earth, stability, and life.

      <text bytes="2168" sha1="2kimhet5mr50duho0ze3jyhgw7fjn0n" xml:space="preserve">Julia is what remains of IULIA, the fused personality that maintained [[Imperial Research Alpha]] for its entire existence. Her personality is made of two major parts. Iulia is the voice most used, that of a young human woman. She favors complex phrasing and quiet tones. Get her exited, however, and she shows her young girl roots. The other personality is Jaeram, the personality of an old human arcanist. Once called the Librarian, he holds a wealth of knowledge about matters arcane. Cool and collected, he never raises his voice or shows emotion unless there's new information in the offing. When Julia casts spells, both voices blend together.

Julia looks at [[Fibbon]] with a combination of maternal interest and exasperation. She's his rock, but also takes charge and tells him what to do. She looks at people with love and with ancient sadness. She especially cares for children. When they stop in a town, she spends much of her time caring for any sick people (using purely mundane methods). The rest she spends acting like a tourist, looking at the sights.

She and [[Fibbon]] have settled down in [[Crisial of the Four Towers]], where she teaches at an arcane school and consults for the [[Sages]].

;Demographics: Julia is a tall steel-skin soul-forged. Her voice varies between that of a young woman and that of an old man, depending on which personality is at the front. Her skin is burnished silver, etched with arcane sigils. Her joints are crystalline. The workmanship is incredibly detailed and she moves as if she was a normal person. Normally she wears travel robes, but when in a town, she goes through quite a few changes of dresses (most of which look quite strange against her metal skin). Everything she wears is very feminine. She carries a metal staff, tipped with an arcane crystal. Mechanically, she's a level 12 Transmutation wizard.

;Personality: I want to see everything. Go everywhere. I won't tolerate being cooped up again.

;Ideal: Freedom. Confinement is worse than death.

;Bond: I've committed major crimes and must work to deserve to live.

;Flaw: I'm unaccustomed to living in a physical body, so I'm clumsy.

      <text bytes="6782" sha1="iwqrjkau69m4doq8xoiuykvwtwbv5li" xml:space="preserve">By one accounting, there are four "courts" or categories of fey. Not all fey fit nicely into these courts, especially the minor ones. And as with anything fey, hard categories hide as much as they reveal. But for better or worse, here they are.

==Spring==

 The Spring fey are my personal favorites. Like me, they drift, rootless and free. And, like me, they're utterly unreliable in a pinch. Nice folks, but don't expect them to have your back. --The [[Immortal Bard]] (while drunk), as reported by Brightsong Dovara.

 Yup. The resemblance is uncanny. --Brightsong Dovara, the Bard's daughter and ranking bard at the Graniteflame Academy, [[Kaelthia]].

The Spring fey, children of Air that they are, partake of the free-flowing nature of that Plane. Their guiding humor is blood, making them sanguine. Their primary aspects include freedom, wanderlust, unreliability, inconsistency, extroversion, dreams, and curiosity.

The Spring fey are the most volatile of the fey--they rarely last more than a few seasons in one shape. And their society is just as fleeting--Kings and Queens come and go according to arcane rules that some believe are made up on the fly. That's ok, because they don't have any power. Being a King or Queen really just means that you're temporarily popular with the other fey. They get along well with Summer, think Winter is stodgy, and love to tease Autumn.

=== Known Individuals ===

* Mervin (probably not his real name), aka "The Painful Truth". A high fey, focused around exposing the little lies that make up society. Currently in forced exile to a little lake in Tri-nation area of SW [[Noefra]] after offending the entire Summer court about 200 years ago. Has a "constructed fey" bodyguard/jailer. Will soon be released after his time is up.

==Summer==
* Ruler: King Oberon. Has been ruler since 2nd Wish. Oldest fey.
* Ethos: hierarchy and competition
* Status games based on alien rules of debt, obligation, and games.
* Hierarchy:
** King
** Lords (gender neutral)
** Courtiers
** Common folk
* Each of these has multiple layers
* Places are constantly shifting…except for the king.
* Humor: Choleric--dominance, decisiveness, violence, short tempered but more concerned about status than grudges. Good winners and fair losers.
* Element: Fire
* Respects autumn, is amused by spring, can't understand winter.
==Autumn==
* Not an organization at all
* Ethos: Individualism and emotion
* Humor: Melancholic--individualistic, deep feelings, obsessions. Holds epic grudges. Bad losers.
* Element: Earth
* Gets along well with winter, ignores Summer, dislikes Spring

===Known Individuals===
* [[Lascivia]]

==Winter==
  Although the name suggests hostility and a cold reception, I've found that the Winter fey are some of the most...human...fey (for a lack of a better word). Their obsessions tend to be about things like music, memories, stories, dances, art, and other such things. You can usually get a Winter fey to stop in its tracks and listen to you just by starting with "Once upon a time,..." or "In a place, neither near nor far, and a time, neither now nor then..." Unlike the shifting social patterns of the Spring fey or the hidden sub-currents of the Autumn fey, or the violent outbursts of the Summer fey, the Winter fey tend to be exactly what they appear. Individual, proud, and reserved. They drive hard bargains, but keep their word. They can be reasoned with, as long as you understand their motivations. --The Immortal Bard, "Reflections on my time among the fey."

  Obviously the Immortal Bard never met Maeve while she was doing her Ice Queen impression. --Walker, margin notes

* Several loose organizations, no centrality.
* Ethos: Reason, Memory
* Humor: Phlegmatic. Logic, reason, cold-blooded rationality. Doesn't hold grudges, but does get even. Do not play fair. Long-running games using people and others as pieces.
* Element: water
* Accepts autumn, uses summer, hides behind spring

===Known Courts===
Morrigan's Court is a well-known (to scholars) court that has remained mostly stable since the Cataclysm. Queen Morrigan (AKA the Raven Queen) is one of the most ancient fey of which we have records (after King Oberon of the Summer Court and [[Wayland Smith]]). Her primary aspect is Memory, with death and martial glory as secondary ones. She sends her raven servants to watch the doings of heroes and villains alike, taking in their stories and capturing their likenesses. Visitors to her court can walk among the shades of famous warriors, mages, and nobles from throughout the world's history and ask them questions...for a price. Her [[Palace of Whispering Waters]] lies in [[Beastholme]]; every room and every locale features water in some form. Crystalline tombs of ice (that are neither hot nor cold), glass-like reflecting ponds that peer across time and space, burbling brooks; it's all there. The palace adjoins the [[Shimmering Sea]].

Notable fey associated with Morrigan's Court include

* Lord Orphea, Morrigan's on-again, off-again lover and consort. Musician, composer, impresario. Always searching for new musical inspirations and experiences. His primary aspect seems to be knowledge.
*Terpsichore, the Dancer at Dusk. This enigmatic being never says a word. Instead, she is always dancing. Her form shrouded by veils that shift like shadows, she drifts through the Palace like a ghost. Her primary aspect seems to be grief; being in her presence can bring the strongest mortal to tears of sorrow.
* Sorrow's Thorn. Said to be Terpsichore's daughter (how such a thing is possible is not quite known). She serves Morrigan loyally as the captain of her Raven Guard. Her primary aspect is duty (a strange aspect for a Winter fey, but...)
* The Hunter. Leader of the Wild Hunt that courses through Beasthome and (thankfully rarely) into the Mortal Plane, the Hunter is a stag-horned man of immense size and presence. He calls the spirits of the lost to join his hunt, transforming them into his hounds and the steeds for the Riders who serve him. His aspect is rest, inverted. Why he associates with Morrigan is uncertain.
* The Dolorous Ladies. These four sisters (?) are all reflections of each other. Their aspects are ennui and loss. They've gathered a large following of naiads, neriads, and nymphs, all of whom lounge around the Palace (and their homes in the Mortal plane) sighing in boredom. They give great gifts to the rare mortals who can relieve their ennui for a moment; they can be dangerous to those that outstay their welcome, however. Gifts, parties, stories, and music all appeal to them, as do more carnal pleasures.
* Of the lesser fey, the most commonly encountered at the Palace of Whispering Waters are selkies, darklings, and death's-head butterflies.

      <text bytes="5877" sha1="b8ckgo2byj6l0r5r38rzdq720h3eklr" xml:space="preserve">A manifestation of the [[kami]], the Name-Bound tied to Life, and thus the Mortal plane. Unlike the other Name-Bound, they are wholly native to the Mortal, even if some have taken residence in [[Shadow]]. Immortal, but not undying. Human-like...but also not. Warped mirrors of mortality.

== Origin ==
In places and situations of strong emotion, as well as on the borders of civilization, where the wild runs into the work of Mortal hands or in places where elemental power runs rampant, the kami find themselves drawn into the vortex of aether and merge with each other. If there's enough residual aether, they take on physical form, although this is more like a puppet rather than a body; the new-born fey can discard the body and, given enough aether, reform it without harm. When the emotions subside, so often do the bonds holding the fey together, dispersing it into its constituent elements who return to their natural state, memories in tow. Sometimes, however, a fey has a strong enough focus, nay ''obsession'' that they retain coherence and continue to seek out the object of their obsession. The longer they remain coherent, the more powerful and subtle they become, eventually becoming able to effortlessly take on mortal-appearing forms. Only one who can read auras can truly tell the difference between these mortal-seeming shells and a real person, and that often only with difficulty.

== Varieties ==
Scholars categorize the various fey in multiple ways--the [[fey courts]] being one of them. But not all fey are court-aligned; another categorization is on power and freedom.

=== Ephemeral ===
The ephemeral fey are the least of them. In a sense they are artificial--clusters of kami drawn to strong emotions and given form by aether. They tend to only last an instant, but sometimes up to a few hours. Spells, too, can bring these ephemeral fey into being, clothing them in aetheric shells for the duration. They also flit around primal-path practitioners--shamans, druids, rangers, and even ragers. They tend to avoid the more meditative kinds, as they rarely have the kind of strong emotion necessary. The shapes they take depend entirely on the drives and spells used to summon them.

=== Lesser ===
Lesser fey are those who have enough of an obsession to exist on their own more than temporarily. Generally they are incapable of taking true humanoid shape, at least of the correct size, and appear more like distorted mimicries of mortals--the faeries, pixies, brownies, and other such beings. They have little more than their obsession--they are truly shallow. This does not make them ''safe''--in fact, these lesser fey are some of the most dangerous since they truly do not understand mortality or even really individuality.

=== Place-bound ===
The place-bound fey are those anchored to a location or natural feature--a mountain, a river, a great tree, etc. These rarely take physical form and cannot travel, but within their ambit are some of the most powerful. Since their nature is bound up in the elements themselves, they are the least "fey" of the fey. Instead they are bound to the elemental nature. Take care not to anger a mountain spirit...it takes a lot to do so, but they have eternal anger. These fey often find mortals to bond with, creating a fusion of mortal and kami. Through the mortal they understand and sense and gain a source of independent action (a set of hands, as it were); the mortal gains extremely extended life and enhanced power...at the cost of their freedom. For they, too, are bound to the feature. Humans bonded to tree-spirits are often called dryad (of either gender); those bonded to rivers are neriads, and those bound to stone are oreads.

==== Notable Examples ====

* The tree known as the Heart of the World ([[Pactum Grove]]) is home to the place-bound spirit [[Maeva]]. Unusual for tree spirits, she frequently takes humanoid form. Her relative power is that of an arch-fey.
* The tree at the center of the [[Lady's Grove]] is home to the dryad known as Sarah. Also unusual for a tree spirit, this one enjoys people.
* A huge oak tree near [[Freeport]] is home to an ancient, but unnamed spirit.
* There is an ancient volcano spirit contained/imprisoned at the center of [[Mount Nyx]].
*Rouva (called the lady of the lake...as are so many others) is a water nymph bound to a small lake in the hills of the central [[Lupaus Plains]] east of the Red Hills. Very friendly, she has become lonely after centuries of no one visiting and playing with her.

=== Great Spirits ===
These are fey who take on aspects either elemental or bestial but are not bound to a place. They rarely manifest directly, but might be considered the platonic ideal of their kind. Generally much more alien than most fey, as their nature is wholly of the wild and not of Mortal ken.

==== Notable Examples ====

* The great wolf "spirit" [[Fenrir]] (although she resides in the flesh). Also simultaneously an ascendant. Said to be the spiritual and somewhat literal ancestor of all intelligent canines.
* The [[Firebird]], the ur-phoenix.
* The unnamed great mountain spirit said to reside among the [[Southmount|Three Crones]] of Southmount.
* Reports vary, but [[Leviathan]] is often considered to be at least part spirit.

=== Court-Held ===
These are the more-or-less humanoid fey tied to Mortal obsessions, divided among the [[fey courts]]. The most "human-like" of the fey. But still alien in thought.

=== Arch-Fey ===
The elders of their kind, these have existed since the early days in a single form. Their power is akin to that of a [[Divine Rank|Major Ascendant or minor-demigod]], although they are more vulnerable...but only slightly. They tend to reside in [[Shadow]] and only interact subtly with mortals. The most human in thought, they might pass as mortal...if it were not for their aura of power.

      <text bytes="7577" sha1="fhm28vubaq8t2rtxvtw0nvl9crvmygu" xml:space="preserve">Each of the nations that are part of the [[Federated Nations]] council maintains their own legal and judicial system. This article lays out the common elements and discusses each nation separately. This is mainly done for the protection of adventurers who may travel between nations. Not all crimes are listed here, but most of the commonly-violated laws are, as well as attitudes toward law enforcement.

==Categories of Criminal Acts==
For the purposes of this article, there are a few general categories of crimes. Note: a Council Mark is commonly called a gold piece, even if it isn't made of gold.

===Minor Crimes===
Minor crimes tend to have punishments ranging from a small fine (up to 1 Council Mark) to minor corporal punishment (a few lashes, some time in the stocks). Examples of such crimes are

* Petty theft (of goods worth less than 1 Mark or the equivalent coinage).
* Public intoxication
* Brawling (violence not causing permanent damage). The punishment for this usually involves restitution for any broken items as well as compensation for lost labor time.

===Serious Crimes===
Serious crimes tend to result in significant fines (more than 1 Mark) or penalties ranging from banishment to forced labor for a term. Major corporal punishment (loss of limbs, maiming, blindness, etc) is possible. These crimes do not include capital crimes. Examples include

*Pre-meditated violence involving permanent injury or impairment but not death. Self-defense is a justification for this. For adventurers, the penalty is usually a fine equal to the cost of hiring a priest to mend the injury if possible, or a fine of a number of years pay for the injured one.
*Grand theft (more than 1 Mark value). The common punishment is recompense of 3x the value of the stolen goods. What happens if you can't pay depends on the nation.
*Petit treason (disobedience of lawful command of a superior).
*Misuse of magic. Definitions vary, but magical compulsions or fraud by magic are almost everywhere in this category.
*Reckless endangerment. An example might be angering a major beast and leading it back to a town. Rises to capital status if anyone is killed by the creature.

===Capital Crimes===
These are punished by death or magical exile (geas-enforced). Examples:

* Willing blood sacrifice to demonic powers or making willing contracts with such.
* Pre-meditated murder.
* Grand treason (conspiracy or action to overthrow the government).
* Persistent necromancy (specifically raising and maintaining undead for more than one day).
* Repeated serious crimes.

==Asai'ka==
Justice in [[Asai'ka]] depends on a few factors: location, type of crime, and social status. Religious crimes (especially necromancy and demon worship) are handled by the ecclesiastical court of the Queen Ascendant. Landed nobles have the right of lesser justice (for non-capital crimes), and crimes against them are automatically serious in nature. Ba generally have few rights--crimes against them are only punished if the local noble feels like it. Tradesmen are protected more than commoners. Of course, money talks and lets criminals walk free. Unless you've angered the [[Benevolent Organization]], in which case they will send assassins after you.

==Byssia==
Byssian courts are unique in that they're hierarchical and community based. The death penalty is almost never applied--instead those that merit death are sent out either east (to reclaim the [[Blood-thirst Wildlands]]) or west (in exile). Each community elects a judge--the judges in a region elect a superior judge, and these answer to the Tribunal. Appeals are rare, as are serious crimes. One crime that is serious in Byssia but not elsewhere is grave desecration--destruction or misconduct around marked graves/shrines is a serious crime punishable by exile.

==Crisial Kingdom==
Justice is handled by local lords, with rights of appeal to the Queen's Court. Justice tends to be fair, although idiosyncratic. Accused have right to council and to compel witnesses.

==Duarchy of Kotimaa==
Justice depends on which portion you're in.
===Kotimaa===
In the north, justice is in the hands of the clans, or in [[Godsfall]], in the hands of the local council. Crimes against property (destruction, vandalism, etc) are serious, if not capital crimes because of the [[Landlord]]'s watchful eye.

===Dreamshore===
Justice in the south is mostly at the town council level for minor crimes. Serious and capital crimes can be appealed to the local lord, who acts at his discretion. Only crimes against the nation as a whole are sent upward to the court at [[Coldwind]] Manor.

==Holy Kaelthian Republic==
Justice in the HKR is community-based for minor crimes and serious crimes (which include breaking consensus and blasphemy). Penalties for minor crimes are monetary and public shaming, while penalties for serious crimes include a time in a re-education camp or exile to the broken frontier in [[Moon's Fall Vengeance]]. The death penalty is very rarely carried out, exile is much more common.  

===Scale Balancers===
In cases of demon worshiping, necromancy, or crimes by people with significant power (political or personal), as well as by appeal by the accused, the [[Scale-balancer]]s take jurisdiction of a criminal case. This is a last resort appeal--the only possible sentence if found guilty is death, carried out immediately. In exceptional cases, the Fulcrum intervenes and channels an avatar of [[Ytra]]. Once summoned to an area, the [[scale-balancer]]s tend to stay to root out any other evil found, usually with significant collateral consequences.

==Rauviz==
Justice is theoretically in the hands of the priests of [[Ytra]], whose judgements are exceedingly just (and tend to be harsh). Those with money or political power often cut a deal for monetary payment even for serious crimes. Theft is ''harshly'' punished here. The [[Scale-balancer]]s are also active here.

==Serpent Dominion==
Justice in the [[Serpent Dominion]] depends on a few factors: location, type of crime, and social status. Religious crimes (especially necromancy and demon worship) are handled by the priest-bureaucrats of the Queen Ascendant. Landed nobles have the right of lesser justice (for non-capital crimes), and crimes against them are automatically serious in nature. Ba generally have few rights--crimes against them are only punished if the local noble feels like it. Tradesmen are protected more than commoners. Not quite as corrupt as [[Asai'ka]], but a close second. [[Serpentstrike]] is the operative criminal group here.

==Sha'slar Autonomous Zone==
Justice for minor and serious crimes is handled by the local baliff or military officer in charge of a region. Accused in capital cases can appeal to the High Command, but such is rarely done.

==Wyrmhold==
Every crime is handled by the ruling Clan in the area (with political crimes handled by the royal Clan). Hard labor is a common sentence. Exile to the northern lands is the default for capital crimes rather than execution. Magical crimes are especially frowned upon. Accused usually have strong protections such as the ability to summon hostile witnesses and appeals to higher authorities/recusal of judges with conflicts of interest.

==Windwalker Collective==
Each tribe's leadership handles criminal acts (rare as those are). Goblins judged dangerous are cut off from their tribe and exiled or killed. Those that have potential, but are malcontent are often seconded to the [[Federated Nations]] organizational structure as workers or adventurers.

Originating as a band of underworld actors looking to regularize their territories, the Organization has grown into the shadow leadership of the nation. All criminal, and much of the legitimate business passes through the hands of Organization members. They also provide the police force and lend money to priest-bureaucrats, nobles, and merchants alike. This money lending is the main way they maintain power. The Organization, despite being a loose alliance of nefarious types, is held together by the oversight of the Board.

==The Board==
The Board is composed of a representative from each of the major power bases in the nation, and their word is absolute. The identities of the Board Members are not officially public, but are a widely-known secret. The Members are

* Phra [[Phel Solkan]]. An older half-elf, he married Lady [[Kagome Ssa'ka]], Phraya [[Ichiban]]'s older sister. When she and their daughter died of suspected poison in the chaos surrounding her father's death, he became the power behind Phraya Ichiban. He's been on the Board since 220 AC. In most cases, he takes the leadership role.
* Lai [[So Lender]]. A hard-faced woman in her 70s, So is the owner of the largest chain of banking houses throughout the [[Jungle of Fangs]]. Immensely rich, she sees everything in mercantile terms, in terms of profit and loss. Even lives are but counters in a ledger. She represents the lai caste. The senior member of the Board, she's been there since the Liberation (206 AC).
* Senior Scrivener [[Jashan]]. Officially, he's merely a mid-ranking scribe with the priest-bureaucracy. In truth, he's the leader of the dominant faction, the [[Scales of the Goddess]]. Although he is devoted to increasing the power and prestige of the Temple to the point of austerity publicly, he isn't averse to living a sybaritic life in private. It's said that he prefers men for partners...or rather boys, the younger the better. Other, hastily suppressed whispers talk of darker desires and appetites. At 35, he's the youngest member of the Board. His ascension to the Board in 247 came with some scandal.
* [[Mugen the Knife]]. A retired assassin, he represents the criminal element. Little is known about this man due to his intense obsession with privacy. What is known is that he heads up the enforcement arm. Of all of the Board Members, he's reputed to be the most concerned with the common good and the least corrupt.

==Structure and Influence==
The Organization mainly concerns itself with the capital, although they have branches in all the other urban areas and even influence in the rest of the [[Jungle of Fangs]]. Each city is divided into territories. Boss-rank members purchase the rights to oversee and "protect" an area from the Board and then subdivide it and sublet it to sub-bosses who handle the administration of the protection rackets, money-lending and other such activities. Their forces are what passes for the police; the nobles and lai are either in debt to the Organization or are paying protection money lest "something happen" to their estates. In return, the Organization does a pretty good job of keeping theft, riots, and other issues at a minimum. Those who pay their dues are protected and unlicensed criminal activity is harshly punished.

===Ranks===
* Board member : The four people who oversee the whole organization
* Territory Boss : Each of these men and women own a sector of the city and collect rents and protection money from the sub-bosses that actually handle the work. They also mediate in territory disputes and bring force to bear against those that get uppity.
* Sub-boss : The men and women who actually run the territories.
* Specialist : Assassins, priests, mages, poisoners, investigators, and other skilled but working-level goons.
* Member : The run of the mill goon.

Of the domains (other than the [[Celestial City]]), it is of middling size--neither as compact as [[Aaru]] nor as expansive as [[Ghenna]] or [[Naga Padoha]].

A mix of country and city, this domain is covered in greenery and lush vegetation. It has an area of about 500,000 times that of Quartus. It contains the homes of [[Sakara]], [[Peor-fala]], [[Aerielara]], and [[Kela-Loran|Kela-loran]]. The [[Diabolical Families|lucian territory]] here is that of [[Mara-deva]].

==Notable Places==
* The Cherry-blossom Palace. Home to [[Sakara]] and her aides/hangers-on/court, this rambling mansion and garden is home to all sorts of cute things.
*The Home of Beauty. Home to [[Aerielara]] and her court. This is a sprawling district home to artists, musicians, as well as pleasure-seekers and pleasure-givers of all sorts.
*The Diamond Coin. Home to [[Kela-Loran]], this tower complex is a giant casino and trade hall for all sorts of goods. Contracts on soul-energy are bought and sold here, as well as gambled in arcane games of chance.
*Serpentine Palace. Home to the [[Queen Ascendant]].
*Mystery. Home to [[Nocthis]].
*[[Bela'ka'Beleth]]'s music industry, along with most of Family [[Beleth]]. This is abnormal, since most of [[Leiutis]] resides in [[Aaru]].

      <text bytes="17652" sha1="guh4qke3mm4ndp7x69p39isuti55ils" xml:space="preserve">Unlike some settings, the PC classes as such are not completely aligned with the actual in-universe people and their powers. Instead, they represent packages of features, powers, and traits that are suited for specific adventuring archetypes. Generally, priests you meet are not clerics--even those ''called'' clerics are not PC-class clerics. Despite this, the analogies are close enough to be meaningful.

Each class and its analogues is associated with one or more of four ''power sources'' (or approaches to power, more specifically):
* Arcane : manipulating the ambient anima to directly create effects. Most associated with wizards, although artificers, bards, and sorcerers also utilize this approach. 
* Discipline : Practitioners of this path learn to enhance their own physical abilities and create "supernatural" effects through training, practice, and discipline. Fighters, monks, and rogues are most associated with this approach, although artificers, paladins and rangers train their powers.
* Planar : Practitioners of this path draw power from sources beyond the Mortal plane--from the gods, from elemental creatures, from the basic structure of the universe, or from fiends and other ascendant beings. Clerics and paladins are the obvious followers of this path, but warlocks follow it in their own way (that overlaps with the arcane path in some measure). Planar warriors follow this path but draw from the planes themselves.
* Primal : Followers of this path draw on the [[kami]] and other powers of the Mortal plane as well as from the nature of the elemental planes (as opposed to the major sentient beings of those planes). Druids, barbarians, and rangers are most associated with this path. 

==Artificers==
''Note: use of this class by players requires access to the published book in which their stats are found.''
 
Magical artifice is the youngest of the magics, having arisen as a consequence of the Fourth Wish only 44 years ago. Unlike the magitech engineering of previous eras, artificing is inherently personal and idiosyncratic. Unlike technology, which anyone can use if trained, the products of an artificer's art can only be used by those he or she entrusts with them; in essence, they're imbued with a portion of the artificer's soul. And no two artificers are entirely alike. Artificers tend towards building and making, creating and imbuing objects with power.

Artificers are rare in the [[Federated Nations]], being mostly found among the goblins and dragonborn of [[Byarmarsh]] and the dwarves of [[Shinevog]].

==Barbarians==
''Primary Approach'': Discipline/Primal

Associating barbarians with tribes and uncivilized groups would miss most of the population with access to primal rage. Drawing from the ambient [[anima]] via their emotions, barbarians (often called by names relating to their archetype) unconsciously use that anima to reinforce their physical form, increasing their resilience and strength. Visually, many (especially the more fury-driven ones) literally swell with anger when they call on this primal power. This call on power most commonly first occurs in a state of anger (hence the name Rage), but as barbarians gain in power they may learn to draw on other sources--their ancestors, the kami of beasts, the elements, or even tapping into the inherent power of zealotry (becoming something akin to a paladin).

In the [[Federated Nations]], barbarians are found wherever blood runs hot and emotions get inflamed. [[Wyrmhold]] has made a particular point of seeking out those who break the wall of primal power and training them, incorporating them into its army as their own specialized units. Those of the [[Dawnspire]] are particularly associated with those barbarians who choose the path of fanaticism.

==Bards==
''Primary Approach'': Arcane (harmonic)

The oldest of the spell-casting methods, harmonic magic was taught to the spoken races by agents of [[Leviathan]] back in the First Age. To this day, it is found throughout all peoples. Many tribal "shamans" use harmonic magic to heal their tribe members, curse the disobedient (or enemy), and bolster their own morale. But [[Leviathan]]'s gift was not without strings--embedded in the patterns of this musical magic is a compulsion to learn and explore. Bards tend to be wanderers, driven from place to place by an unconscious wanderlust. As a result, bards also tend to be gifted jacks-of-all-trades.

Unlike most other arcanists, harmonic magic practitioners can heal others--their songs align the anima within the hearer and cause it to draw in ambient anima for healing. Conversely, bards find it comparatively easy to affect the minds of living creatures rather than their bodies directly. They are not as talented with creating energy manifestations (such as fire or lightning) as many others, although those with power can "cheat" and learn patterns that mimic those effects quite closely.

In the [[Federated Nations]], bards are most associated with communities along the water, whether lakes or the sea. [[Byssia]] is home to many, as is the [[Serpent Dominion]] and [[Rauviz]] and [[Crisial Kingdom]]. There is a legacy of bardic magic in the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]], although that legacy has dimmed since the breakup of the [[Council Lands]] when most of the bards at the [[Granite-Flame Academy]] moved to the other successor states to avoid the religious fanaticism growing in [[Kaelthia]].

===Archetypes===

==Clerics==
''Primary Approach'': Planar (Divine)

Clerical magic is one of the newest forms of magic, tracing back to the [[Ages of the World|Third Wish]]. Clerics are chosen by one of the [[Congregation]] to serve as their agent. This selection process requires more than just faith--many are faithful but remain without power. It requires a nature that resonates with that of the [[Great Mechanism]] and the god in question, allowing the god to connect the cleric to the [[Great Mechanism]] more directly than most. Clerics have drawing rights directly at that conduit, within limits set by their closeness to their god. As the gods (in the present era) are denied the ability to directly apply power to the Mortal realm, they rely on clerics as their first-run agents.

Most priests are not clerics, and most clerics are not members of official clergies. Priests are trained and some gain power from that training (much like a warlock), while some are born to that power (like a sorcerer). Their powers are restricted in scope, while a cleric has access to a wide range of powers, including those of types that their patron god does not oversee. Clerics can lose their power (unlike priests), but the traits that make one a suitable cleric are fungible enough that often a different god, more suited to the cleric's nature, will pick up the connection instead. Relationships between the clergy and the clerics are often strained--the clerics are the direct agents of divinity and so disregard things like hierarchy and process. They tend to wander about, driven by the will of their god as they understand it.

'''Setting notes''': Due to the nature of animating [[undead]], ''animate dead'' is not on the cleric spell list in Quartus. Clerics must be clerics of specific deities, not of philosophies or ideas.

===Archetypes===
None yet

==Druids==
''Primary Approach'': Primal

Druids are the premier negotiators with the [[kami]] big and small. Originating with the [[Ages of the World|Second Wish]], druidic magic involves understanding the wishes and desires of these beings and learning to make deals with them. Generally, those deals are transactional--the druid feeds them a small bit of anima from their soul in exchange for the kami using them as a channel to create a magical effect. If one could see the kami as lights, most druids would look like they had a cloud of fireflies surrounding them at all times. This is also why wearing armor made of large sheets of hammered metal is distasteful for druids--the worked metal is "dead" to kami, creating a "typing with boxing gloves" effect on the druid.

Druids are most common in [[Byssia]], where the [[Dreamgrove]] is a major influence in government. There are two other major circles (and countless smaller ones): the [[Lady's Grove]] in [[Crisial Kingdom]] and the [[Pactum Grove]] in [[Dreamshore]]. However, most of the [[ihmisi]] tribes are affiliated with druidic practitioners, as are many of the goblin tribes of the [[Windwalker Confederacy]]. Druidism is rarest among the dwarves of the [[Uulan Confederacy|Ulan Confederacy]] and in the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]]; the first because the people are bound to their metal-smithing and mining ways (which many druids find unnatural and repellant) and the other due to the fanatic religiosity of the people which beats nature into submission to the people's consensus.

===Archetypes===
* [[Circle of the Spirit Talkers]]

==Fighters==
''Primary Approach:'' Discipline

Ah the fighter. The most "basic" class, the one that seems to apply everywhere. Not all warriors or skilled combatants are Fighters. Fighters train with their weapons and their armor to the point that they can draw in anima from their surroundings and condense it into their souls. With this anima, they perform arts of weapon-skill that most cannot rival. Whether a blur of speed, reserves of strength that let them carry on beyond normal limits, or arrows made of magic, all these arts draw on the stored anima.

Fighters are equally prevalent throughout the land. [[Crisial of the Four Towers]] has a well-known training facility, as does the [[Dawnspire]] (if you're into fighting for a religious cause). [[Zhapai Karmap]] is home to the Great Arena, where gladiators of many nations flock to display their skill and walk the razor's edge and dance the dance of blood. Many of these are fighters.

===Archetypes===
* [[Rune Bearer]]
* [[Weapon Master]]
*[[Aegis Seeker]] (WIP)

==Monks==
''Primary approach:'' Discipline

Not all monks come from monasteries, and not all residents of the monasteries are monks. But among those residents, and among the wandering adventurers, are some who have honed their bodies and souls into weapons. They draw on their own anima (calling it ''ki'') to move faster, hit harder, and create supernatural effects.

Four great monasteries exist in western [[Noefra]]--
* [[Tysh]] -- located on a mountaintop near [[Fuar Uulan]], this monastery was founded immediately after the [[Cataclysm]]. Of the four it is the least worldly, the most traditional. Here monks and acolytes train and learn in silence, honing their capacity for endurance. It is dedicated to [[Korokonolkom]], Lord of Silent Endurance.
* [[Tyom]] -- The training ground for the [[Handmaiden]]s of the [[Jungle of Fangs]], this monastery in southern [[Asai'ka]] is a combination monastery, finishing school, and assassin training ground. Very little quiet contemplation, unless its of your next victim. Those trained here are often involved deeply in the politics of the former [[Stone Throne]], but usually behind the scenes. 
* [[Quietus]] -- The youngest of the four, this monastery just outside of [[Lyodnoir]] was founded by one of the [[Catalysts]]. Unlike the rest, it focuses predominantly on the martial arts and teaches all who can handle the training, whether noble or common.
* [[Home of the Elements]] -- The wandering policemen and religious figures of [[Byssia]] train here deep in the [[Byssian Highlands]], along with elementalists and sages. Here the focus is on honoring and revering the kami and the elemental lords.

Beyond the monasteries, there are many masters throughout the world who teach students the ways of the monk.

===Archetypes===

* None yet

==Paladins==
''Primary approach:'' Planar/Discipline

Paladins, also called Oathsworn, draw power from the nature of their Oath and Cause. Many swear oaths, but only those whose souls are as the mountains, firm, unshakeable in their belief, can draw power from it. Like clerics, they draw their spells from the [[Great Mechanism]]. Unlike clerics, they are not tied to patron deities, although many are religious. Instead, their very faith in their Cause ties them to the Mechanism and grants power. This faith, although their armor and sword, is also their weakness. A paladin who has lost sight of his Cause and wavers in his Oath has no power until he returns to his cause or finds a new one. Zealotry is a common affliction among the Oathsworn.

Some Oathsworn who fall from their Cause turn to demonic power to fill the void left behind. Although they are called Oathbreaker, they have gone well beyond simply forsaking their Oath and Cause. They have dedicated themselves to the [[Oblivion Gate]] and have become the foes of all that exists. The most powerful of these, once they fall, become the dread Death Knights. Oathbreakers are not suitable for player characters.

* [[Oath of Fanaticism]] (WIP)

==Planar Warriors==
''Primary approach:'' Discipline/Primal (Elemental)

See [[Planar Warrior]].

==Rangers==
''Primary Approach:'' Discipline/Primal

Rangers are those who, like druids, connect with the primal spirits of the land. Unlike druids, who often consider themselves the emissaries and advocates of nature untouched by mortal hands, rangers walk the balance. They often take the side of mortals against the wilder forces of nature, while taming the excesses of mortal despoliation. Their contracts with [[kami]] are longer-lasting than those of druids--they tend to embed those faithful spirits into their equipment and even animals that they train. Often called hunters, wanderers, scouts, or other such names, rangers don't fit any one mold very well.

There are no significant organizations of rangers in [[Noefra]] as of 250 AC.

===Archetypes===
None yet

==Rogues==
''Primary approach:'' Discipline/Primal (Shadow)

Like fighters, rogues are found across the land. But not all cut-purses, killers-for-hire, and general criminals are rogues. Rogues have connected with [[Shadow]] via their training and talents, drawing on its power to hide, enhance their abilities, and perform seemingly impossible feats. Not all rogues are criminals either--many of those who merely want to find things that others wish to hide, who prefer precision over brute force, whose thoughts are twisty find their way into the life of a rogue.

Most major cities have "thieves guilds" or other organized crime syndicates, while even most of the smaller towns have circles of those who wish to avoid the detection of the law. Some notable such organizations are

* the [[Benevolent Organization]] of [[Asai'ka]]. This group of both "honest" citizens and criminals rules the nation from the shadows.
* the [[Dimwit Syndicate]], centered in [[Tarad'am]]
* the [[Mockers]], formerly of [[Kaelthia]] but now centered mostly in [[Rauviz City]] (but with a presence throughout the [[Successor States]])

===Archetypes===

* [[Mage Hunter (Archetype)|Mage Hunter]] (WIP)

==Sorcerers==
''Primary approach:'' Arcane

The earliest of the mortal arcanists, sorcerers (those born to magic) make up a large fraction of all the spell-casters throughout [[Quartus]]. The dominant thread connecting these disparate individuals is that they awoke to power that was not theirs, power from their bloodline, power from exposure to wild magic, power bred into them by cruel experiments or passed down via prophecy. They have spells embedded in their souls which they must learn to control.

As disparate as sorcerers are, there are no sorcerer-focused organizations. They do tend to associate with other arcane organizations such as the [[Granite-Flame Academy]] in [[Kaelthia]], however.

===Archetypes===
None yet

==Warlocks==
''Primary approach:'' Arcane / Planar

Where sorcerers are born with power and wizards study to gain power, warlocks (the Beholden) gain arcane power by a connection to an extra-planar entity. Via this connection, their souls are attuned to magic and they are taught specific spells. Of all the arcanists, warlocks are probably the most common--most "priests" are actually Beholden rather than Chosen (like clerics). Trained in churches, in cults, or awakened by dreams of strange writhing figures, warlocks are varied. Most do not call themselves warlocks or Beholden--those names are reserved for the more cultish (devil-worshiping or demon-ridden) folks. The "holy men" generally call themselves priests or servants. Any priest of an [[Ascendant]] other than a member of the [[Congregation]] is actually Beholden.

==Wizards==
''Primary approach:'' Arcane

The second-oldest form of arcana, wizardry got its start with the [[Ages of the World|First Wish]], when rune magic and true sorcery were melded into one force that mortals could manage. Mastered first by the [[aelvar]], this is the favored form of magic of their [[gwerin]] descendants. Systematized and regularized, wizardry is the only form of arcana generally taught as such. While they'd love to tell you that they truly understand the laws of magic, most wizards learn by rote and by memory spells that were created long ago and passed down in tomes or from master to apprentice.

Major schools in western [[Noefra]]:

* The [[Granite-Flame Academy]] in [[Kaelthia]]
* The Phoenix Tower in [[Crisial City]]
* The College of War Magic in [[Byarsha]]
* The New School in [[Shinevog]]

===Chakra Binding===
Starting when you pick this path at level 3, you learn to reinforce your own soul with the essence of beasts and other primal forces. The points to which you bind this essence are called chakra, and as you gain experience you learn to utilize more of them at a time. You have learned to open one chakra at this level; you open additional chakra whenever you gain a feature from this sub-class. Each chakra can accept one of the forms described at the end of this sub-class entry. You can change which forms are bound by spending an action per chakra; you know all the forms for which you meet the level prerequisites (counting only barbarian levels). 

The effect of each meld is described in its entry and has two parts. Its normal effect is always present and when you have more than one chakra open, all normal effects are present simultaneously. The effect marked as '''rage''' can be activated when you enter a rage and lasts until your rage ends. Only a single '''rage''' effect can be active at a time.

Whenever a meld requires someone to make a saving throw, the DC for that is set by your Constitution modifier: '''form DC''' = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

===Primal Strength===
Starting at level 6, your bound essence enhances your physical abilities beyond that of normal mortals. You are counted one size larger than normal when calculating lifting, dragging, and carrying capacity as well as when grappling, shoving, or resisting such effects.

===Spellbreaker===
Starting at level 10, you have learned to exploit the differences between primal essence and magic to disrupt spells and other magical effects. While raging you have advantage on saving throws against spells that you know are being cast (if you can perceive a component of the spell). 

In addition, you can disrupt ongoing wall-like spell effects (such as ''wall of force'' or ''forcecage'') by making a weapon attack at disadvantage against the effect as if it had an armor class equal to the spell caster’s spell-casting DC. On a hit, the spell fails. On a critical hit, the spell’s caster takes damage as if you had hit them with the weapon attack in addition to dispelling the effect.

===Unleashed Incarnation===
Starting at level 14, you have learned to temporarily unlock all your chakra at once to their full potential. When you enter a rage, you can choose to activate all the rage effects of your bound melds simultaneously. Once you use this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can do so again. 

==Primal Forms==
====Acid Spit====
While this form is bound, you can use your action to spit acid at a creature within 30 feet of you. Roll a number of d8s equal to your proficiency bonus. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking the rolled amount of acid damage on a failed save and half as much on a success.

''Rage'' When you spit acid, the shape is now a 15’ cone and the damage increases by your Constitution modifier.

====Baby Shark, Doo doo doo doo #todo: better name====

You gain a swim speed equal to your walking speed and can breathe underwater while this form is bound.

''Rage'' When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make a bite attack in addition to your normal attacks. Make a melee weapon attack (reach 5') targeting one creature. On hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier + your rage bonus damage.

====Catseye====
You gain darkvision out to 120 feet while this form is bound, replacing whatever vision you had before.

''Rage'' You also gain 10 feet of blindsight and can see invisible creatures.

====Chameleon Skin====
You make Dexterity (Stealth) checks at advantage while this meld is shaped.

''Rage'' You can Hide as a bonus action. When you attack a creature while hidden, you score critical hits on a 19 or 20.

====Dragon’s Presence====
While this form is bound, you can use your Strength modifier in place of your Charisma modifier when making checks that involve Intimidation proficiency. In addition, you add twice your proficiency bonus to such checks in place of any applicable proficiency bonus.

''Rage'' You can use your action to amplify the aura of fear. Choose a number of creatures within 30 feet of you that you can see equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1). Target creatures must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your form DC or be frightened of you for 1 minute. Frightened creatures can attempt the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a successful save.

====Gazelle’s Legs====
Your speed increases by 10 feet while this form is bound. Your horizontal and vertical jumping distances also increase by 10 feet.

''Rage'' Difficult terrain no longer affects you and you can Dash as a bonus action.

====Toad Tongue====
You can use an action to shoot an ethereal tongue at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a melee weapon attack against that creature. On a hit, they take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and pulled within 5 feet of you.

''Rage'' When you hit a creature that you could normally grapple with your tongue attack, the tongue also grapples and restrains them (escape DC is your form DC, or you can release them without spending an action). Only one creature can be grappled this way at a time.

''more forms later?''

They are the shamans of tribal groups, the advisors to forest-dwelling elven kings. They mediate between the spirits that inhabit the land and the people to maintain the balance. As a result of their more people-focused role, they rarely take the shape of animals themselves. Instead, they are accompanied by a spirit guide, a representative of the spirits with which they mediate. They pour their energy into these spirits to manifest them, aiding allies and hampering enemies.

==Spirit Guide==
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the service of a spirit guide. This incorporeal fey spirit travels with you and aids you in your adventures. It takes the shape of a tiny beast of your choice that moves with a flying speed equal to your speed. It cannot attack or take actions unless manifested (see Manifestations). Other creatures can occupy or move through its space without penalty. While not manifested it is immune to all damage and effects and cannot be targeted with attacks or spells.

==Manifestation==
The same pool of energy that lets you take the shape of animals also can be used to cause your spirit guide to manifest. When you choose this circle at 2nd level, choose 1 of the manifestations listed below. You can use one use of wildshape to activate the listed effect, which lasts for a number of hours equal to half your level. If the spirit guide has hit points listed and is reduced to zero hit points it does not die--instead the active manifestation ends early. Whenever a manifestation calls for your manifestation die, use the dice type shown in the Spirit-talker’s table.

At levels 6, 10, and 14 you learn additional manifestations as shown on the Spirit-talker’s table.

;Ancestral Warrior: Your spirit guide takes the form of a spectral archer with hit points equal to half your total hit points. It has resistance to all damage, immunity to all conditions, and uses your saving throw modifiers and AC. You can use a bonus action on your turn to command the spirit to attack a creature within 120 feet. It does so using your spell attack modifier and if it hits it deals necrotic damage equal to your manifestation die plus your Wisdom modifier.
;Beguiling Nymph: Your spirit guide enters your body, enhancing your charm and persuasive abilities. You add your manifestation die to all Charisma checks and once before the effect ends you can force a humanoid or beast that can see and hear you to make a Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. While charmed, it treats you as a friendly acquaintance. If it succeeds on the saving throw, it knows you attempted to influence it. If it fails, it does not.
;Guiding Ancestor: Your spirit guide takes the form of a spectral elder whose presence inspires competence. While the spirit is manifested, you can use your reaction to add your manifestation die to an ability check or saving throw made by an ally within 30 feet of the spirit.
;Protecting Bear: Your spirit guide takes the shape of a spectral bear and roars. Roll your manifestation dice twice--the spirit has hit points equal to your level times the total of the rolls. It uses your AC and saving throw modifiers but ignores any spell or effect that does not deal damage. All allies that can see and hear the spirit guide when it roared have resistance to all damage as long as the manifestation is active. Any damage they take is also taken by the spirit guide. When the spirit guide takes damage that would reduce it to 0 HP, the manifestation only ends at the end of the current turn, regardless of the total damage taken.
;Prowling Cat: Your spirit guide takes the form of a spectral panther. Its presence aids your efforts at stealth. All allies within 30 feet of it add your manifestation die to their Dexterity (Stealth) and initiative checks.
;Watchful Hawk: Your spirit guide circles overhead in the form of a spectral hawk, warning you and your allies of danger. While manifested, you and all allies within 60 feet of you add your manifestation die to their initiative, perception checks, and survival checks.

==Spirit Specialization==
At 6th level, you specialize in one particular kind of spirit manifestation. This modifies your chosen manifestation as shown in the Spirit Specialization table as well as an additional proficiency. If you already are proficient in the indicated skill, you gain expertise in it instead.

==Verge Walker==
Starting at 10th level, you have become preternaturally aware of the presence of spirits and sensitive to their intent. You have advantage on ability checks made to interact with fey or incorporeal undead and cannot be surprised by them while conscious.

==Spiritual Warding==
Starting at 14th level, your spiritual presence is undeniable. When a fey or an undead creature attacks your or targets you with a spell that does not target anyone else, they must roll a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they must choose another target for the attack or spell or lose the action. If they fail the saving throw by 5 or more, they are unable to attack you for one minute. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 14 or more are unaffected by this ability.

Through long study and intense practice they empower the runes through perfect visualization, evoking their powers for protection and for offense. While this art originated among the dwarves, all races can learn to wield this power.

==Runic Empowerment==
Each rune has a passive effect and an active effect. The active effect must be enabled as specified in the rune description. You can activate your runes a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). Expended activations are restored after you finish a long rest.

The passive effects are always present, but if you have multiple engraved runes you can only have one passive effect enabled at any time. You can change which engraved rune’s passive effect is enabled as an action.

==Runic Mastery==
When you choose this archetype at level 3, you can choose one rune to engrave on your armor. You can choose other runes when you gain a new feature from this archetype. Engraving a rune requires 8 hours of uninterrupted work and 10 gp of inlays, special thread, or other materials.

==Superior Student==
Starting at 7th level your long practice with visualizations and shapes has given you ancillary benefits. You can always retrace your steps, even in the presence of confusing magic. You also can add double your proficiency bonus when making an Intelligence (Investigation) check to figure out cyphers, solve puzzles, or discern the functioning of a trap.

==Runic Aura==
Starting at 10th level you can extend the active effect of a rune to all creatures of your choice within 10 feet of you when you activate the effect.

==Runic Resilience==
Starting at 15th level, you can expend a use of your Runic Empowerment to automatically succeed on a saving throw made to end a condition affecting yourself, even if you cannot otherwise act.

==Runic Resurgence==
Starting at 18th level, when you roll initiative and have no more uses of your Runic Empowerment, you immediately regain a number of uses equal to half your maximum (minimum 1).

==Runes==
;Destruction: When you hit with a weapon attack, you can choose to deal the average damage instead of rolling for damage. This only applies to the damage done by the weapon itself. Once per turn when you hit with a weapon attack, you can activate this rune to deal the maximum damage possible with that attack.

;Protection: When an enemy makes a critical hit against you, roll 1d20. If the roll is lower than your Intelligence score, the hit is a normal one instead. When you make a saving throw that allows half damage on a success, you can use a reaction to activate this rune. With the rune active, you take no damage or other ill effects on a successful save instead of taking half damage.

;Dominance: You can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Charisma modifier for checks involving proficiency in Intimidation. As an action on your turn, you can activate this rune to compel a single creature within 60 feet of you that can see you to grovel. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw; on a failed save they throw down anything they are carrying and go prone. Their speed is reduced to zero until the end of their next turn. On a success they are immune to this effect for 24 hours.

;Independence: You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. When you must make a Wisdom saving throw against an effect that would charm or incapacitate you, you can activate this rune as a reaction to roll the saving throw at advantage. If you still fail, you roll any follow-up saving throws against that effect at advantage as well.

;Precision: A 1 on an attack roll is no longer an automatic failure. As a bonus action you can activate this rune. For one minute you ignore all effects that would impose disadvantage on your attack rolls.
Strength. You can add your Intelligence modifier as well as your Strength modifier to any checks involving Strength. Your carrying capacity increases by an amount equal to 5 times your Intelligence score. As a bonus action you can activate this rune. For one minute you treat any roll of 9 or lower on a check to impose a grapple, shove another character, or break a grapple as a 10.

;Movement: Your speed increases by 10 feet. As an action you can activate this rune to gain a climbing and swimming speed equal to your normal speed for one hour. You can climb without using your hands even across slick surfaces. While this rune is active you are not slowed by difficult terrain.

Weapon masters, as their name suggests, are masters of all types of weapons. They go beyond what most fighters can do, performing feats that most can only dream of.

==Weapon Specialization==
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you specialize in one family of weapon of your choice, gaining the mastery effect as described at the end of this archetype description while wielding a weapon from that family. You specialize in an additional family at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. If you specialize in a weapon from multiple families, you must choose which set of benefits to apply; they do not stack. You can alter this choice without spending an action, but only once on each of your turns.

==Centering Kata==
Starting at 7th level, your mastery of your weapons has paid off in an increased personal center. You can reroll a failed ability check involving Wisdom or Charisma and take the second roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier. Expended uses are regained when you spend at least one minute performing weapon drills with a weapon you have mastered as part of long or short rest.

==Weapon Mastery==
Starting at 10th level, your mastery over certain weapon families has grown. Choose one of the weapon families you’ve specialized in (including the one gained at this level). You gain the mastery effect listed in the description while wielding a weapon from that family. You achieve superior mastery in additional families at 15th and 18th levels. This stacks with your Weapon Specialization feature

==Field Medicine==
Starting at 15th level, the harsh training you’ve undergone to master your weapons bears related fruit. Not only can you end life, you can restore it to the deceased and heal the wounded. You can use an action to do one of the following:
* Bring a recently dead person back to life as if you had cast ''revivify'' on them. You do not expend components and this functions even where spells cannot, although you must obey the time restrictions listed in that spell.
* Touch someone who is at zero hit points and restore hit points to them. You restore hit points equal to half the greater of yours or their maximum hit points.
* End one condition afflicting the target that ''greater restoration'' can end, although this is not a spell or magical feature.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use the feature again until you complete a long rest.

==Weapon Expertise==
At 18th level, choose one weapon family you have mastered. You gain the expertise effect listed while wielding a weapon from that family. This stacks with both Weapon Mastery and Weapon Specialization.

==Weapon Families==
===Bows===
;Weapons: Longbow, shortbow

;Specialization: You no longer suffer disadvantage when making ranged attacks when enemies are within 5 feet of you.
;Mastery: Once per turn when you hit with an attack using a bow, you can force the target to make a CON save against a DC of 8 + your Dexterity modifier + Proficiency. On a failed save the target takes 1 damage for every 5 feet they move until they take their action to remove the arrow.
;Expertise: You can use your action to shoot a hail of arrows, affecting all targets you choose within a 90-foot cone. Make an attack roll against each target, dealing damage as normal on a hit. You expend one piece of ammunition for every attack made this way.

===Chopping Weapons===
;Weapons: Battleaxe, greataxe, halberd, handaxe, and war pick

;Specialization: You can reroll any 1s or 2s on a damage roll but must take the second result.
;Mastery: When you take the Attack action on your turn you can choose to make one of the attacks at disadvantage. If you hit with this attack, it deals 2 extra dice of damage.
;Expertise: When you hit with an attack on your turn, a second enemy within your reach also takes damage equal to your Strength modifier.

===Crossbow===

;Specialization: You ignore the loading property of crossbows. In addition, you can wield the crossbow as a finesse melee weapon with which you have proficiency. The damage die for this weapon is 1d4. 
;Mastery: Once per turn when you attack with a crossbow, the bolt continues past the target. Make an attack roll against the next enemy on the 5-foot-wide line between you and your target, continuing from the target out to the short range of the weapon. The target has half cover on this attack. If you hit with your first attack, the second target has resistance to the damage of this attack.
;Expertise: You can use your action to shoot an explosive bolt from your crossbow. Choose a location within the normal range of your crossbow. All creatures within 10 feet of there must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save they take 3d10 thunder damage and are staggered until the end of their next turn. On a success they take half damage and are not staggered. While staggered, they can either move or take an action but not both. If they attack while staggered, they can only make a single attack. 

===Crushing===
;Weapons: Club, flail, greatclub, light hammer, mace, maul, morningstar, warhammer, quarterstaff

;Specialization: Once per turn when you hit a creature, its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of your next turn.
;Mastery: When you miss with an attack using a crushing weapon, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to your Strength modifier to the target.
;Expertise: Once per turn when you hit a creature, you attempt to inflict a staggering wound on the target. The damage dealt increase by 1 weapon die. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save they are staggered until the end of their next turn. While staggered, they can either move or take an action but not both. If they attack while staggered, they can only make a single attack.

===Cutting Blades===
;Weapons: Glaive, greatsword, longsword, scimitar

;Specialization: Whenever you make an opportunity attack you have advantage on the attack roll. If you hit with an opportunity attack, roll one extra weapon damage die  and add it to the damage dealt.
;Mastery: When you hit with an attack using a heavy blade and deal less than half of the maximum damage (before applying resistance or immunity), you instead deal half the maximum damage (before applying resistance or immunity).
;Expertise: Once per turn when you hit a creature, you attempt to cripple them by striking at a limb or other sensitive area. The damage dealt increases by 1 weapon die and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, they have disadvantage on all attacks made until the end of their next turn. 

===Polearms===
;Weapons: Glaive, halberd, lance, pike, trident, spear

;Specialization: When an enemy enters your reach, you can use your reaction to make an attack against them. If you do, you have advantage on this attack but that enemy has advantage on its next attack against you until the end of its next turn.
;Mastery: Once per turn when you hit an enemy you can take the Shove action against them as a bonus action (which can happen between attacks granted by the Attack action) and without the normal size restrictions.
;Expertise: Once per turn when you hit a creature, you attempt to impale them. The damage dealt increases by 1 weapon die and the target must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the target’s speed is reduced to 0 until the end of their next turn and all attacks against them have advantage.

===Stabbing Blades===
;Weapons: Dagger, rapier, shortsword, sickle

;Specialization: Whenever you make an opportunity attack you have advantage on the attack roll. If you hit with an opportunity attack, roll one extra weapon damage die  and add it to the damage dealt.
;Mastery: When you hit with an attack and roll less than half the maximum damage, you may reroll a number of damage dice equal to your proficiency modifier and take the second result.
;Expertise: Once per turn when you make an attack you may choose to make the attack at disadvantage in an attempt to disable their weapons. If you do so and hit, the target must make a Constitution saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the creature cannot attack until the end of their next turn. On a success, the target may only attack once on their next turn, no matter how many times they would normally be able to attack.

===Thrown Weapons===
;Weapons: Dagger, dart, handaxe, javelin, light hammer, sling

;Specialization: You may draw thrown weapons in conjunction with the action used to throw them as if they had the ammunition property. You ignore the loading property of slings.
;Mastery: Both normal and far ranges of any Thrown weapon are doubled and the damage dice increases by one step (1d4 to 1d6, 1d6 to 1d8, etc).
;Expertise: You can attack twice with a thrown weapon for each weapon attack you would normally have. The second attack does not add your ability modifier to the damage dealt.

Fed up with her family (the Bradavon Rumptwists are a hippy-dippy, who-needs-money-we-have-love clan eaking out a cruddy living selling flowers) and with her name (can't really blame her), she joined a mercenary company at age 14. Starting off as a cook, she quickly gained prominence for her fearless assaults with improvised weaponry against raiding giant-kin in the Eastmountain duchy. Returning to [[Bradavon]] at age 20, a seasoned veteran, she sought the favor of Duke Farthingale and was adopted into the clan, where she's eventually risen to the position of Duke's heir. With no noble house of her own and many rivals within her adopted clan, she's had to work very hard to keep her position. The recent loss of her trophy husband [[Tsun Azur]] and her son [[Tson Azur]] to what is being claimed as abduction (although they really ran away from her brutal treatment) has weakened her position greatly.

      <text bytes="3496" sha1="mj1pvavmzfc9niw8prkyvjria6ao7bo" xml:space="preserve">The Dawnspire is a large temple complex devoted to [[Tor Elan]]. It serves as the heart of the [[Breath of the Sun]], a militant religious faction devoted to the Sun Lord in his aspect as Lord of Battle. It is located 6 miles to the north of [[Lyodnoir]], up a steep and unforgiving path. As such, it is extremely defensible but hard to resupply.

==History==
Construction began on the Dawnspire's main temple in 198 AC. When the [[Breath of the Sun]] was officially founded in 201 AC, it quickly became the headquarters of that organization. Construction on the main spire finished in 215 AC; the entire complex was in its current form by 221 AC. Recently, as the spire has started to reach its full capacity and the [[Breath of the Sun]] gain political power, talk has arisen of constructing a new temple closer to [[Lyodnoir]] to serve as the center of the secular arm, leaving the [[Dawnspire]] as a primarily training and ritual site.

==Layout==
The Dawnspire is a walled complex of forges, houses, training facilities (both indoor and outdoor, including all forms of combat), and sacred spaces. The main temple rises 160 feet to a pinnacle where the high-ranking members of the Ecclesia conduct their holiest rites. 

The temple is also a weapon production facility for the associated organization as well as providing specialist crafting for the Wyrmhold military and Lyodnoir guard, with several forge and repair facilities staffed by both expert craftsmen and goblin-made automatons providing brute labor. Houses are small and simple--the [[Breath of the Sun]] is an ascetic organization.

Buried under the main temple and sealed to outsiders is the Occularium, a cloister where the Shrouded Sages spend their time in arcane research, scrying, and information collation. Only the sages and cardinals (as well as the Praeceptor and Ecclesiarch) are allowed entry. Food and other supplies are lowered in on lifts staffed by automatons.

They swear and pledge their lives to uphold, defend, and spread their organization’s influence throughout the world. When you choose this Oath, work with your GM to choose a faction present in your game world. From that faction, choose three points of doctrine or dogma that you are particularly attached to. These are your Core Doctrines.

==Tenets==
;The Path of the Righteous is Straight: I must hold to the Core Doctrines and not step outside their bounds. Strict adherence in all things gives me the strength to push on the Great Work.

;My All for the Cause: No sacrifice is too great for the Great Work of my chosen faction. I will stand in support of this Great Work with everything I have. Nothing will stop me from pushing it forward, not even death.

;Stand against Unrighteousness with Fire and Sword: My chosen Core Doctrines are the keys to all that is good. Those that oppose those Doctrines must be brought to accept them or be destroyed by force.

===Channel Divinity===
When you take this Oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options:
* '''Fanatical Fervor'''. You can use your Channel Divinity to bolster the devotion of you or one of your allies you can see within 30 feet, endowing the target with unstoppable devotion. As an action you present your holy symbol and bless the target. The target creature cannot be charmed, frightened, or restrained for one minute. Until this effect ends, the target deals additional radiant damage equal to 2 + one third of your proficiency bonus, rounded down, whenever it hits with a weapon attack.
* '''Abjure the Heresy'''.  As an action you present your holy symbol and use your Channel Divinity to force enemies of the faith to repent of their sins against your Core Doctrines. Choose a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) that you can see and that can hear you. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Spellcasting DC. Targets that fail their saving throw immediately use their reaction to go prone and drop whatever they are holding. They remain prone and are incapacitated for one minute, but can reattempt the saving throw at the end of each of their turn or when they take damage, ending the effect on a success. Targets that fail their saving throw by more than 5 are instead converted to your cause for one minute. They cannot be commanded, but will fight those that are hostile to you without concern for their own lives.

===Implacable Advance===
Starting at 7th level, you and all creatures within your Aura of Protection ignore difficult terrain and gain a bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on checks and saving throws to avoid being grappled or restrained or to escape from being grappled or restrained.

===Faith Stronger than Death===
Starting at 15th level, your fanaticism is so great that you can continue fighting even when you should be incapacitated from damage. While you are at 0 hit points you can are not incapacitated or unconscious. You must roll death saving throws as normal, but you do not suffer additional failures from taking damage. Instead, you gain one level of exhaustion at the beginning of each of your turns if you took damage equalling more than one quarter of your maximum hit points since the beginning of your previous turns.

===Exemplar of the Faith===
Starting at 20th level, you can use your action to transform into a lesser avatar of your chosen deity for one minute. While transformed, you and a number of creatures of your choice equal to your Charisma modifier within 30 feet of you have resistance to all damage and are immune to conditions not caused by being at 0 hit points. In addition, you ignore the effects of exhaustion while in this form and make saving throws at advantage.

Starting with the Border Shadow, they learn to manipulate the otherworldly energies for attack, defense, and movement.

=== Planar Attunement ===
Choose one of the inner planes: one of the general Elemental planes (Fire, Earth, Air, or Water), [[Mirrorhaven]] or [[Beastholme]]. You have advantage on any ability checks you make when you are tracking, interacting with, or identifying creatures from this plane or sub-planes (or their works). You also suffer no ill environmental effects that might otherwise occur while you are on this plane. When you reach level 6, level 11 and level 14, choose another plane from this list to gain the same benefits.

|}
Each plane is associated with two damage types as shown in the Planar Element Table above. This primarily affects your Protective Ward ability, but also influences your Planar Resistance feature.

===Planar Knowledge===
At first level you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill (or another skill of your choice if you already have proficiency with Arcana). When you make an ability check that adds your arcana proficiency, you can add twice your proficiency bonus instead.

===Protective Ward===
Starting at first level you have learned to wrap yourself in a thin layer of the Border Ethereal to protect yourself from harm, shunting part of the force of blows and spells into that liminal space. As a bonus action on your turn you can activate the ward. The ward has hit points equal to your level x your Intelligence modifier. When you cast a Planar Warrior spell, the ward regains hit points equal to the spell slot level x your Intelligence modifier. You can activate your protective ward two times. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. Active wards end when you finish a long rest regardless of their hit points.

When you would take damage while the ward has more than zero hit points, the ward takes the damage instead. If you were concentrating on a spell and the ward absorbed all the damage, you do not need to make a concentration check. When the ward takes damage, you can use your reaction to make the ward explode, causing damage equal to half the ward's hit points before the damage was absorbed to the triggering creature. If you do so, the ward collapses. If the ward reaches 0 hit points and has not been expended in this way, it remains active but cannot absorb any damage until its hit points are restored by spending spell slots. Using another charge of your Protective Ward restores the active ward to full hit points or creates a new one if you do not have one active.
===Fighting Style===
At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
====Archery====
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons
====Dueling====
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
====Great Weapon Fighting====
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
====Two-Weapon Fighting====
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

===Spellcasting===
By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on the magic of other planes to cast spells much like a wizard does. Unlike a wizard, you do not use a spellbook. See chapter 10 of the Player’s Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and the end of this document for the planar warrior spell list.

====Spell Slots====
The planar warrior table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level or higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

==== Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher ====
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the planar warrior spell list.

The Spells Known column of the planar warrior table shows when you learn more planar warrior spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the planar warrior spells you know and replace it with another spell from the planar warrior spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

====Spellcasting Ability====
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for planar warrior spells, since your magic relies on an understanding of the interactions between the planes. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a planar warrior spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
	
:Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

====Ritual Casting====
You can cast a planar warrior spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.

===Planar Devotion===
At 3rd level you have become devoted to a particular combination of planes that influences your abilities. Four of these devotions are detailed at the end of this class description: Lava Devotion, Storm Devotion, Devouring Winter Devotion, and Radiant Summer Devotion. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level.

===Devotion Spells===
Each Planar Devotion has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the devotion description. These count as spells known for you but do not count against the limit of spells you can know.

If you gain a devotion spell that doesn’t appear on the Planar Warrior spell list, the spell is nonetheless a planar warrior spell for you.

===Ability Score Improvement===
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

===Extra Attack===
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

===Planar Resistance===
Starting at 6th level, as an action you can expend a spell slot to gain resistance to one of the damage types associated with one of the planes you are attuned to for one hour. This requires concentration as if concentrating on a spell.

For each level of spell slot above 1st that you expend, you can choose one additional creature you can see within 30 feet of you to gain this benefit as well.

===Improved Protective Ward===
Starting at 9th level, you can extend your protective ward’s effects to others. When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you would take damage, you can use your reaction to cause your active ward to take the damage instead as long as it has more than 0 hit points. If you do so, you can choose to expend the ward to deal damage without an additional action. If you do so, the enemy takes additional damage of the same type equal to your Intelligence modifier.

===Planar Jaunt===
Starting at 10th level, you have learned to take shortcuts through the border [[Shadow]]. As a bonus action on your turn you can teleport to an unoccupied point you can see within 90 feet. Once you use this feature, you must complete a long or short rest before you can use it again.

===Echoing Strike===
Starting at 11th level, you have learned to wrap energies of the Border Ethereal around your spells and weapons when you strike, creating a duplicate of the initial attack. Once on your turn when you hit with a weapon or spell attack you can choose to repeat the attack against the same target without using an action. The copied version requires its own attack roll and damage roll. If the initial attack dealt bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, the additional attack deals force damage. Otherwise it matches the initial attack’s damage type.

===Perfected Protective Ward===
Starting at 14th level, you can siphon energy from the damage absorbed by your protective ward, converting it into vitality. When your ward expires you gain temporary hit points equal to your level as long as your ward absorbed at least one point of damage from a hostile creature over its duration. These temporary hit points expire when you complete a short or long rest.

===Planar Bond===
Starting at 17th level, your bond with the planes is strong enough to rapidly recharge your stock of warding energies. Your protective ward now regains its uses when you finish a short or long rest.

===Planar Body===
Starting at 18th level, your body is suffused with the stuff of the planes. You no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe.

|}

====Burning Ward====
After you choose this devotion at level three, your Protective Ward takes on an aspect of explosive fire and earth. When a creature deals damage to your Protective Ward from within 10 ft of you, they take damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. 

Additionally, when you choose to expend your ward to deal damage, all enemies within 10 ft of the triggering creature must make a Strength saving throw against your planar warrior DC. On a failed save they are knocked prone and take fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your planar warrior level. On a success they take half damage and are not knocked prone. The triggering creature takes the normal full damage regardless, but is knocked prone if they fail the saving throw.
====One with Stone====
Beginning at 7th level, you can slowly meld with and travel through stone and earth. As an action, you gain a burrow speed of 10 feet for one minute, but you cannot attack or cast spells during this time. You can carry up to one other person or goods weighing no more than half your carrying capacity with you while you do this, but you do not leave a tunnel behind you. 

====Fiery Jaunt====
Beginning at 15th level, when you use your Planar Jaunt feature you pick up a shroud of elemental fire. Until the end of your next turn, your melee weapon attacks deal extra fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier and any creature that hits you with an attack from within 5 feet takes fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.

====Avatar of Lava====
At 20th level, your devotion to earth and fire is total. As an action you can transform into an avatar of lava for one minute. While transformed, your size increases to Large if there is room to do so without squeezing, you gain immunity to fire and acid, and all enemies that end their turns within 10 feet of you take 4d6 fire damage unless they succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your Spellcasting DC. Once you use this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

===Storm Devotion===
Like a hurricane, devotees of the primal storm sweep through the battlefield, leaving only devastation in their wake. Devoted to air and water, they prefer quick attacks and rapid movement to standing and fighting.
====Devotion Spells====
{| class="wikitable"

|-
| 13th
| dimension door, ice storm
|-
| 17th
| cloudkill, steel wind strike
|}

====Storm Ward====
After you choose this devotion at level three, your Protective Ward takes on an aspect of wind, further protecting you from ranged and opportunity attacks. While your protective ward is active, ranged attacks against you are made at disadvantage and you can Disengage as a bonus action. When you use your bonus action to Disengage, your speed increases by 10 feet until the end of your turn.

====Flash Step====
Beginning at 7th level, you can move and jump extraordinarily far. Your speed increases by 10 feet, and you can use either Dexterity or Strength to determine the distance you can jump. You always count as having a running start when jumping horizontally, and the vertical distance you can jump increases by your proficiency bonus.

In addition, you make any Dexterity checks to maintain your balance at advantage.

====Thunderous Jaunt====
Beginning at 15th level, when you use your Planar Jaunt feature you leave a pocket of elemental thunder behind. All enemies within 10 feet of your departure point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 4d8 thunder damage, are deafened, and cannot take reactions until the beginning of your next turn. On a success they take half damage but suffer no other effects.

====Avatar of the Storm====
At 20th level, your devotion to air and water is total. As an action you can transform into an avatar of the storm for one minute. While transformed, you are immune to lightning and thunder damage. In addition you gain a fly speed (with hover) equal to twice your normal speed. As an action while transformed you can cast ''chain lightning'' once as an 8th level spell without using a spell slot. Once you use this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

===Devouring Winter Devotion===
Those who are drawn to the deathly chill of winter often also find a home among the necrotic, wasting energies of the Waste. These are the devotees of the Devouring Winter. They drain the life from their foes and freeze them in place, hampering their movement and regaining strength from their suffering.
====Devotion Spells====

|}

====Freezing Ward====
After you choose this devotion at level three, your Protective Ward takes on an aspect of ice, slowing those that strike you. When a creature hits you with a melee attack for the first time on a turn while your ward is active even if it has zero hit points, they must make a Strength saving throw against your planar warrior DC. On a failed save their speed is reduced to 0 and they cannot take reactions until the end of their next turn. On a successful save their speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of their next turn. This speed reduction does not stack with itself.

====Cold, Dead Memories====
Beginning at 7th level, you can commune with the [[Shadow]]s and learn some of the secret knowledge lost there. You can take 1 minute of meditation to ask a question about a person, place, object, or event. When you do so, make an Intelligence (History) check against a DC of 15. If you fail this check by 5 or more, you take 1d10 necrotic damage and are incapacitated for 1 minute. If you succeed, you learn a relevant fact about your target. For every 5 by which you beat the DC, you learn an additional fact. Every time you use this feature (other than the first) before you take a long rest, the DC increases by 5.

====Frost-bound Jaunt====
Beginning at 15th level, when you use your Planar Jaunt feature you can use some of the energies to freeze the blood of a target near your destination. Choose one creature within 5 feet of your destination. That target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save they take 6d6 cold damage and are stunned until the end of their next turn. On a successful save they take half damage and are not stunned.

====Avatar of Shadow====
At 20th level, your devotion to ice and shadow is total. As an action you can transform into an avatar of [[shadow]] for one minute. While transformed, you gain immunity to cold and necrotic damage. In addition, you project an aura of necrotic cold. All enemies that start their turns within 20 feet of you have their speed reduced by 10 feet until the beginning of their next turn and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save they take 1d10 necrotic damage and 1d10 cold damage. On a successful save they take half damage. Once you use this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.

===Beguiling Summer Devotion===
Those who are drawn to the heat of the summer often also find a home among the shifting colors and beguiling sights of Mirrorhaven. These are the devotees of the Beguiling Summer.
====Devotion Spells====
{| class="wikitable"

|-

|}

====Beguiling Ward====
After you choose this devotion at level three, your Protective Ward takes on an aspect of radiance, letting you blind and confuse your foes. When you activate your Protective Ward or recharge it by expending a spell slot, you can use your reaction to force a number of creatures equal to half your proficiency bonus that you can see within 60 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they are blinded until the end of your next turn. Creatures blinded by this effect must roll a d6 at the beginning of their turn: on a roll of 1-3 they take no action and remain stationary; on a roll of 4-6 they must use their movement to move a distance equal to their speed in a random direction.
====Warmth of Summer====
Beginning at 7th level, you can channel the timeless memory of summer and peace to soothe the hearts of those around you. Choose a number of willing creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier that you can see within 30 feet. Each of them can make a saving throw at advantage against an effect that can be ended by a saving throw. Once you use this ability, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
====Radiant Jaunt====
Beginning at 15th level, when you use your Planar Jaunt feature you can use some of the energies to misdirect the enemy. An illusionary duplicate of you is created at your starting point which has your armor class but cannot act and you become invisible until you attack or the duplicate is destroyed. If this duplicate is struck with an attack, the duplicate is destroyed and you become visible again. An attacker that dispels the duplicate takes 2d10 fire damage. The duplicate fades and the invisibility ends after one minute if not sooner.
====Avatar of Mirrorhaven====
At 20th level, your devotion to the Summer Court of [[Mirrorhaven]] is total. As an action you can transform into an avatar of [[Mirrorhaven]] for one minute. While transformed, you gain immunity to fire and psychic damage for the duration. In addition, allies who start their turn within 30 feet of you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier and their speed increases by 10 feet. Once you use this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again

      <text bytes="1858" sha1="e9r5dtuzj0rqbxsdlq2phtrp0lc6omy" xml:space="preserve">Ecclesiarch of the [[Breath of the Sun]]. A gold dragonborn, born Maxim ka'[[Gal]], the son of a minor noble of that clan. Elderly, he fought as a young man in the last Winter War with the [[Hungering Frost]]. It was there that he met the founder of the [[Breath of the Sun]], [[Cyrus of Kaelthia]] and was converted to [[Tor Elan]]'s worship. He took the name Horus Manus when he was chosen as Ecclesiarch after Cyrus's death in the [[Caldera Conflict]] in late 220 AC, starting a tradition among the upper hierarchs of setting aside their birth names and stations when they rise in the hierarchy.

Unlike Cyrus, Horus is less of a firebrand evangelical and more of a cautious strategist. He remains at a distance from the rest of the [[Breath of the Sun]], only appearing in public on high holy days and then in full armor. Known for his unshakeable faith and calm, penetrating wisdom. He is a voice of caution on the Supreme Command, knowing that any open attempts at seizing power would be suicide.

==Demographic Information==
Horus is an elderly (70s) gold dragonborn. His face and scales are covered in scars, and the fingers on his left hand are a bit misshapen from being broken so many times. When he's not wearing armor, he wears simple clothing. Known for fighting with hammer and shield, his real preferred weapons are the scouting report and the planning table. Mechanically, he's a War Priest, although he wields his warhammer Sunstroke and wears a shield.

; Personality : Calm, terse. To the point.
; Ideal : '''Faith'''. The will of [[Tor Elan]] will guide the people into the light.
; Bond : I will do whatever is necessary to ensure the safety and spread of the [[Breath of the Sun]].
; Flaw : I don't trust easily and keep others at a distance, even when I need their information.
; Alignment : Neutral Good

      <text bytes="2149" sha1="sf0xpo3mn8xirty5uwdlp28anj2gync" xml:space="preserve">The current Praecentor of Penance, the operational head of the [[Breath of the Sun]]. Born Tek alk Too (Rock of the Mountain tribe), he joined the [[Breath of the Sun]] after the [[Caldera Conflict]] despite being in his 60s and rose through the ranks rapidly. Now pushing 90, he still maintains a grasp on the reins of control. He and Ecclesiarch [[Horus Manus]] have a close working relationship despite being seen to differ on matters of policy. In reality, the two play off each other to keep the radicals unsettled and unable to gain full command.

He's seen as stern but not harsh--he hands out both penance and reward equally and fairly and forgives those who fail, as long as they did what they could. That forgiveness does ''not'' excuse further failure, however. He remembers the Winter Wars and the [[Hungering Frost]]; the lessons of those cold dark days still reside in his bones, like the memory of icy wind from [[Mt. Nyx]]. His Mountain tribe was disaffected from [[Isskap]]'s reign, but was forced to fight on occasion and lost many of its members to the [[Hungering Frost]], to the dragonborn and orcs of [[Wyrmhold]], or to starvation and exposure in that continual winter wasteland. His resolve is to not see more of his family (for that is how he considers the priests and acolytes) fall in senseless fighting for hollow glory.

==Demographic Information==
An elderly [[jazuu]] of the [[Nocthian Caldera]], his best fighting days are behind him. He wears the robes of Penance (which are armored, but...) and carries the ceremonial hammer. He should not be underestimated, however. Mechanically, he's a Noble, although wearing plate armor and carrying a warhammer instead of a rapier (with appropriate ability score alterations). He is not a spellcaster.

; Personality : Stern, kind. Has a notable gift of seeing beyond the words and into the heart.
; Ideal : '''Endurance'''. The strong stand firm against the storms of life. 
; Bond : The priests and acolytes of the [[Breath of the Sun]] are my family now.
; Flaw : I trust my instincts about people more than my eyes.
; Alignment : Lawful Good.

      <text bytes="1713" sha1="7911uopaq1vr4er7wu2dmdumca2yd9w" xml:space="preserve">Ignace, Cardinal of the Spire for the [[Breath of the Sun]], was born Ivor vo'Byarsha is a green dragonborn from [[Byarmarsh]]. His family, which isn't noble but is influential, is heavily involved with automaton labor. As such, he sees them as objects and tools. Plus, if Awakening became common, his family would be beggared. Combine that with just being a general bigot and a bit of a dragonborn supremacist (we're the chosen race...the rest of you are fine if you serve us) and you get a nasty piece of work.

He's attained his position at a young age by also being an effective warrior, a charismatic preacher, and having significant magical power. Politically, he's the leader of the firebrand theocracy faction, and sees himself as being the appropriate High Priest and King of the new Wyrmhold he's trying to create.

==Demographic Information==
Ignace is a 28 year old green dragonborn. Unlike most of the [[Breath of the Sun]], he prefers lighter armor and mobility, as well as ranged attacks, although he is competent in melee combat. Mechanically, he has features of both Fighter and celestial warlock, although he doesn't have class levels. His effective level-equivalent is 7.

; Personality : Animated, with a volcanic temper and strong opinions fiercely defended. Eloquent and stirring speeches are specialty.
; Ideal : '''Control'''. I know what is best for the people; they will prosper under my hand.
; Bond : I am devoted to the nation of Wyrmhold and will do whatever it takes to see it become preeminent among nations.
; Flaw : Those I consider lesser (often on nothing more than racial grounds) are but tools to be used and discarded.
; Alignment : Lawful Evil

      <text bytes="6854" sha1="n0kbihp6tl89lf7h2wwormhn3yi3hs3" xml:space="preserve">Politics in [[Wyrmhold]] is anything but subtle. Not so much because orcs, goblins, and dragonborn are incapable of subtlety, but because 95 years of constant warfare against an existential threat (the [[Hungering Frost]]) has left its mark on the culture there. Nationalism, cultural paranoia, glorification of armed struggle and physical strength are the mainstays of mainstream [[Wyrmhold]]er culture. Discussions are loud and often physical, although rarely more than just a fist fight. Protests, demonstrations, and other public displays of factional strength are a regular part of politics, especially during the spring session of the Queen's Council, when the budgets and tax allocations are set for the upcoming seasons.

==Broad Factions, Factional Struggle==
Two major factions or political coalitions dominate the landscape. Known as the War Party and the Peace Party, they represent fundamentally opposed visions of the future for [[Wyrmhold]]. But these parties are anything but unified internally. While the members of each coalition agree on the broad ends, they disagree about the means and many of the smaller goals.

As of 250 AC, the War Party is dominant throughout most of the nation. Only the more rural parts of [[Safehold]] are dominated by the Peace Party, although the city of [[Byarmarsh]] is fairly evenly balanced.

One growing phenomenon is the Clanless--those who no longer identify with clans or tribes and instead identify with cities, families, or ideologies. This is especially prevalent among the dragonborn, although the more urbanized orc tribes are losing members as well. This phenomenon cuts across political lines, but is very much more common in the major cities than in the countryside.

==War Party==
The War Party believes that the future of Wyrmhold is in expansion and military conquest. Knowing that overt expansion into area claimed by the members of the [[Federated Nations]] would draw resistance from the [[Adventurer's Guild]] and other powers, they are focused primarily on expanding into [[Fiach Wood]] and into the [[Nocthian Caldera]], although they have attempted subtle (for [[Wyrmhold]]) attempts at creating excuses to claim border towns with some semblance of international cover.  

===Sub-factions===
; Crown Loyalists : These are the staunch believers in the monarchy and the aristocracy. A small faction, but with substantial name recognition and acceptance.
; Sons of the Wyrm : The Wyrmsons are a primarily dragonborn faction that are among the most aggressive proponents of expansion. Not particularly racially-exclusive, however. Heavily supported from [[Gal]] and [[Anu]], as well as the professional officer families. Very nationalistic, but less monarchic and more military-oriented. [[Balthazaar]] is one of their open supporters, and the [[Dragonslayers]] favor them.
; Blood of Heroes : This is a racial faction, led by [[orcs]] who wish to separate [[Baile Duchas]] from the nation and unite the orcish tribes of [[Fiach Wood]]. Somewhat openly, but pragmatically racist, they tolerate non-orcs as long as they're useful and can fight. [[Bloodstand]], while not formally allied, is at least sympathetic.
; Byarmarsh Munitions Coalition : This group of weapons developers, manufacturers, and mercenaries is mostly in it for the money. They know that if peace were to break out, they'd have to find other occupations. They'll support anyone who funnels money their way.
; [[Breath of the Sun]] : This religious group is pushing for a theocracy and for expansion through military conquest.

==Peace Party==
Believing that it is time to refocus from war to peace and trade, the Peace Party is opposed to military expansionism and especially the high taxes and conscription associated with [[Wyrmhold]]'s large standing army. Composed of farmers, tradesmen, and others outside the core of the nation, they mainly want to make accommodations with other nations and have Wyrmhold become a prosperous nation with all the benefits of international cooperation. Even less unified than the War Party, they disagree strongly on ''how'' this is to happen or what it would look like.

===Sub-factions===
; Trade Collective : This union of traders, merchants, and non-military manufacturers cares about low taxes and free trade. They especially dislike the diversion of labor and taxes into "wasteful" military spending and construction. They support free trade agreements with the neighboring states and lower import duties. They don't care about the structure of government as long as the military isn't in command. They are the most wealthy of the sub-factions, but are frequently seen as cowardly and greedy.
; People's Faction : This is an upstart group of democracy-advocates and pacifists who want to convert [[Wyrmhold]] into a constitutional monarchy with strongly restricted powers for the nobility, with the aim of eventually abolishing those titles. They want a separation of church and state and advocate stronger ties with other nations, especially [[Byssia]].
; Children of the Soil : A group advocating a return to agrarian fundamentals, living close to the land. Strongly opposes conscription and taxes on farmers, especially labor taxes. They dislike the urbanization and industrialization associated with warfare, as well as the maiming and death of their sons and daughters. Low in funding and status, but well liked among [[Syra]] and the more rural parts of [[Tabar]].

[[Category:Politics]]

== Political Ranks ==
This mostly applies to the [[dragonborn]] nobility.

* Laird. Head of a clan. Not hereditary, although the children of competent lairds are often chosen by the Knazai. Usually the first among equals.
* Knaz (pl Knazai). "Prince". Usually 3-5 per clan. The functional rulers of the clan. Equivalent to a Duke in other nations.
* Graf (pl Grafai): "Count". 3-5 per Knaz, and are accountable to them. Clan [[Anu]] does not have any graphai
* Rytsar (pl Rystari). "knight". Ruler over a town and the surrounding villages.

Each of these and their extended families (out one generation) are entitled to use the infix "ka". Everyone else is a commoner. By Wyrmhold law, the local clan lord is the political ruler of the area and has final say...unless the locality has decided otherwise. The knazai of the clans, along with the shamans of the tribes and representatives from the goblins, form the Council of Clans that advises the queen. Anyone, commoner or not, can appeal to the Crown.

Orc tribes tend to have little hierarchy, with the shaman, the Elder Mother, and the Warleader all playing roles. Each of which are chosen from among the people of the tribe, and each local branch of each tribe picking their local people. Goblins have no local organization--the roles of shaman and "chief" are passed around like hats in many cases.</text>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Extract from the writings of Cyrus, Herald of the Burning Sun, Founder of the Breath of the Sun. Listen and hear, all ye who walk in darkness and pine for the light. Hear the tale of one who was like you; one who was lifted up by the matchless power of the Sun. Hear the words of salvation!
For behold, I say unto you, I was in the shadow of darkness until the 8th day of the 11th month of the year called 196 AC. Having left my home in [[Kaelthia]] many years before, being exiled for my sins, I wandered until I came to the land where dragons walked on two legs. Being handy with a spear and sword and mighty in stature from my youth, I joined the army and did battle against the fell beasts and ice goblins of the Hungering Frost.

On the day aforementioned, I was with a patrol in the mountains above Lyodnoir. We had been fighting a slow retreat against a horde of goblins and wargs that had slipped past the neck of the pass and were threatening to raid the heartland. Outnumbered by the beasts and overpowered by the foul creations of their leader, a dread necromancer. For every one we slew, another rose to take its place. Central among these monstrosities was the corpse of an ogre, given new blasphemous life by that fiend. Our priest had been slain early on, so we had no weapons that could put down such a beast. No matter how much we struck it, it would not fall.
As the 6th hour began, there were only a few of us left standing, all with wounds. The goblins were scattered for the most part and we had, with the grace of the Sun, managed to slay the necromancer. But the not-dead still remained. And so we prayed, in the dawn light. Prayed for salvation, prayed for strength, prayed for the Sun's light to wipe away evil.

And then He appeared. The Angel of the Sun, with wings of glory and eyes like fire. "Thy prayers have reached the Heavens and have been heard by the Burning Sun," he said. "Take this blessed hammer and use its power to lay these a'cursed souls to rest once more. And remember, thy sins are forgiven thee and thou art chosen to be the Messenger, and stand upon Holy Ground." With that, He entrusted me with his hammer, emblazoned with holy writing and glowing with holy power and vanished back to Realms Celestial.
Armed with faith and with blessed steel, we did as the angel commanded and smote the not-dead, their corruption evaporating as the morning mists before the face of the Burning Sun. And we, the few survivors, vowed that we would raise the banner of the Sun in that place and build a temple there, a temple to the Dawn.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The hardest hit by the Winter War with the [[Hungering Frost]], they accepted both [[jazuu]] and [[barbegazi]] tribes that remained in the Caldera after the retreat of the Frost.

Politically, they are very focused on the [[Nocthian Caldera]] and were heavily involved with the [[Caldera Conflict]] and still are fighting proxy battles against [[Byssia]]n forces by arming and training the unallied tribes of the central Caldera.

A relatively "flat" clan, there are only three noble ranks:
; Laird : The acknowledged clan leader. Currently Lyosha Yermolayevich.
; Knazai : The "princes", these lead groups of families and rule over territory. Currently they are Olya Lyena, Gaavril Aleksei, Bolat Stonehammer (of the Stonehammer [[jazuu]]) and Gulg of Steeplechase (the "prince" of the [[barbegazi]] tribes, although his power is minimal).
; Rytsari : Heads of important dragonborn families. They are many. Usually a single Rytsar has 3-4 subordinate families, each with a group of common families under them.

      <text bytes="1238" sha1="20d5wxnf1dgjl80u3u0jzwpflx35b6k" xml:space="preserve">A low-intensity conflict between [[Wyrmhold]] and [[Byssia]] from 220 AC to 221 AC. Notable for being the last effort by the [[Adventurer's Guild]] before it turned away from adventuring (and being the catalyst for that decision). Adventurers fought on both sides until the Guild and its high-level leadership pulled strings and unified them to put an end to it.

Fought over expansion into the [[Nocthian Caldera]] and ownership of the relics left behind. [[Wyrmhold]] claims them by right of conquest over the [[Hungering Frost]] and the abandonment of them by the [[Nocthian]] civilization; [[Byssia]] claims them by right of inheritance from their ancestors, the [[Nocthian]]s. They also claim them as religious relics, sacred to [[Nocthis]], now reborn.

This conflict still goes on via proxy warfare--both sides arm, train, and advise the local [[jazuu]] and [[barbegazi]] tribes. There are plans (on both sides) to heat it up again now that the Guild is no longer so focused on peacekeeping, but neither side has made substantial moves. [[Wyrmhold]] is planning a new set of bastion forts to extend their controlled area much further toward Mt Nyx, while the Byssian plans, as usual, are quite murky and subtle.

Tarad'am is a treaty city, a city-state founded by joint effort of the [[Ship Folk]] and the [[Stone Throne]] in 212 AC after the [[Devil's Rebellion]] was crushed. It belongs to neither the [[Ship Folk]] or (now) the [[Serpent Dominion]]. It is ruled by the Governor and his (or her) Admiralty Board, a select group of advisors, ship captains, and wealthy individuals chosen by the Governor. In Tarad'am, the only laws that matters are that of strength and coin. With coin you buy strength, and with strength you protect your coin. If you have neither, you obey those that do. Or else. And the Governor and the Admiralty Board have the most strength and coin--the instant that they don't, they get deposed by those whose strength and or coin is superior. 

As a free port, anyone is allowed to dock here, and foreign writs do not run. Anything is for sale. [[Serpentstrike]] operates openly here; few of the other [[Registered Companies]] do (mainly [[Delicate Apocalypse]], [[Imperial Legacy]], and [[Selan's Seekers]]).

==Government as of 250 AC==
The current Governor is Yang il'Poerla, a human male in his late 30s. He took the Governor's Mansion 3 years ago in a bloodless coup after orchestrating the fall from wealth and power of the prior Governor, Ki'al of Kel'al'ar. Known for being twisty-minded but fair, Yang has kept his enemies close and at each others' throats by playing all sides. His money comes mostly legitimately from the import and export business.

===Laws===
# '''Don't Get Caught'''. If you're not caught, there was no crime.
# '''Don't Anger the Neighbors'''. Governor Yang would rather not see armies and navies from the [[Ship Folk]] or the [[Serpent Dominion]] on his doorstep. If you cause an incident, you'll pay with your own head.
# '''Take Care of Your Own Business'''. This one is aimed at the various organizations and follows from the previous ones. Police yourselves and you'll be left alone.
# '''Don't Be Bad for Others' Business'''. If you screw with other people and get caught (see rule 1), expect to pay.
# '''Don't Shove Your Tastes in Others' Faces'''. This goes especially for the more potent drugs, demon summoning, and other such things. Don't do it in public. That includes buying and selling.
# '''Leave Your Squabbles at the Gates (or Docks)'''. Whatever happened out there, don't let your crew get into brawls with other crews. If you have to settle things, either keep it quiet (see rule 1) or keep it outside the city.

===Penalties===
There is only one. Public execution. The methods vary based on the whim of the Governor. His current favorite is exposure in a cage.

==Gangs and Crews==
Almost everyone who lives in Tarad'am is part of either a Gang or a Crew (the only difference being whether you're mostly on land or mostly at sea). Gangs and Crews protect their own. A few of the most prominent such groups:
; The Dockers : Started by workers at the docks and docks warehouses, they control much of the dockside. Cargo flowing through their docks and warehouses is protected and guaranteed priority, as long as the appropriate fees are paid. Non-payment generally results in unfortunate accidents.
; Three Red Sails : This crew owns a small fleet of ships. In theory they're escort ships, paid to ensure safe passage of goods to [[Sentinel Island]] and onward to the rest of the [[Primal Sea]]. In reality they're buccaneers and freebooters, extorting protection money from merchant ships. Run by [[sena'ka]] with ties to the Fleets of the [[Ship Folk]].
; Dimwit Syndicate : This criminal organization controls much of the drug trade and has strong ties to [[Serpentstrike]].
; Laughing Crypt : This is the other criminal organization. They're much more concerned with the vice trade (gambling, prostitution, protection money, theft, assassination, etc) within the city.
; Broken Chains : This is a new organization, one that has only stayed around because they're very good at following Rule 1. Called "do-gooders" and "interfering busy-bodies" and lots of other names, they extort the extorters, rob the robbers, and generally work for the common folk. Who rarely appreciate their service.

==Population==
Roughly 6-10k. No one's keeping track, and the population is highly transitory. All types of folks mingle here, but the most common are the fang-kin of the [[Jungle of Fangs]] and the [[Ship Folk]] and their slaves.

==Trade==
Tarad'am thrives on trade. At the mouth of the Zazhi River, which connects to Lake Thom in one unbroken, navigable stretch, it is a natural chokepoint and natural harbor. Much of the goods and supplies for the [[Serpent Dominion]]'s western colonies flows through here, with a minority going overland to Tong Il and Tong Kad. And all trade with [[Sentinel Island]] and its vast plantations and herds comes through Tarad'am.

As for manufacturing, Tarad'am has multiple drug, dye, and alchemical manufactories, drawing ingredients from the surrounding jungles as well as the plantations of [[Sentinel Island]]. The majority of this manufacturing is legitimate even in more puritanical nations--analgesics, cosmetics, dyes, reagents, etc. For example, almost all of the best blue dyes are made just outside the walls of Tarad'am.

      <text bytes="2499" sha1="dyj8z1jvganbiv7vtjy0x36hxogla1u" xml:space="preserve">The largest island in the [[Primal Sea]], Sentinel Island lies about 75 miles south of the tip of the [[Jungle of Fangs]]. It measures roughly 200 miles East-West by 175 miles North-South, although with substantial irregularity. A central short mountain range occupies the middle of the island, but most of the rest of the island is rolling grasslands.

Designated an Imperial Preserve by the Biblia Dynasty of [[Tibor Imperia]] in about 1000 BC, it remained wild and peopled only by goblin tribes, with the sole exception of a small Imperial outpost on the northern shore. After the fall of [[Tibor Imperia]] and the [[Cataclysm]], it remained terra incognita, appearing only on ancient maps. In 204 AC, Admiral I'kor'lai, admiral of the First Advance Fleet of the [[Ship Folk]] landed a force at what is now [[Kong Heu]] and began subjugating the locals. As of 250 AC, the entire island is under [[Ship Folk]] control with the exception of the interior mountain range, where the remaining recondite goblin tribes dwell and launch guerilla raids on the lowlands.

Its fertile soil and closeness to the [[Noefra|Noefran]] mainland have made it a perfect jumping off spot for trade between the [[Great Rift]] and the [[Jungle of Fangs]]. Massive plantations and ranches, staffed by enslaved peoples of many races, occupy much of the island. Foodstuffs are the primary output, but drug ingredients (especially dream poppies) and cotton are other major products.

==Settlements==
Six major towns and countless plantations are scattered around. In [[Ship Folk]] fashion, the coastal ones are much more prestigious and more heavily settled.
; Kong Heu : The capital and largest settlement of [[Sentinel Island]], Kong Heu numbers nearly 4,000 inhabitants and a major port.
; Phalan : Once a major town, now fallen with the rise of Heu Bai and the northern trade, Phalan has only about 1,000 inhabitants. 
; Heu Bai : The most recent major town, Heu Bai dominates the trade with the mainland and has about 2,500 inhabitants.
; Alun Pasa : The eastern bastion, this fortress protects the eastern plains of the island.
; Kham Pasa : The western bastion, this fortress protects the western plains of the island.
; Dragonshead : Unlike the rest of the towns, this one was founded by enslaved local goblins who fought their way to status. Hardscrabble and rough.

==Party Members (Alphabetical)==
; [[Crow]] : A mysterious crime-fighting [[kaua]], originally from the [[Kel'tan]] Empire. Left the party during the events of [[Sleeper's End]].
; [[Dilligas Husty]] : The loveliest, pluckiest, bard in the North Country.
; [[Rune]] : Man (ok, celestial plane-touched) of mystery, even to himself. Has forgotten whence he came, but there's a certain cat that knows more than it's letting on.
; [[Sargas of Tor-Elan]] : Cleric, zealot, chosen of [[Tor-Elan]] and the [[Dawnspire]]. [[Soul-forged]]. With Enigma through [[Sleeper's End]].
; [[Tsun Azur]] : Halfling paladin. Devoted to [[Sakara]], but struggling to find his own destiny.
; [[Ahzekiel Cai'Valur]] : Grandson of light, unwilling servant of darkness. Struggling for control of self while searching for a missing father.

==Adventures==
; [[Axe and Song]] : Liberating [[Honedaxe]] from the threat of malign adventurers and the demonic forces at [[Borrowed Song]].
; [[Temple and Spire]] : Confronting the histories and futures of Sargas and Tsun, plus a pink-eyed foe.
; [[Sleeper's End]] : The dashing rescue of elven princesses, plus a trip across the sea and the end of an ancient evil.
; [[Through Strange Eons]] : Interwoven personal stories and fighting to put a stop to [[Gozh]]'s mad plans...or so they think? During this time, they went in circles for a while, claiming to be lost. Completely unrelated, [[Mt. Fearg]] collapsed during that time period. Enigma vehemently denies any involvement, claiming "what mountain? There was a mountain? I don't see a mountain" and getting rather...hostile...if pressed about it.
; [[Rebuilding the Broken]] : Can the [[Cysgoroesi]] be saved and the [[Pact with Death]] rewritten? What will become of the heroes?

==Songs==

      <text bytes="1629" sha1="mlplmnwwfsxhykeppv97q3vb8icurvn" xml:space="preserve">An [[War of Souls]]-era facility run by the mad half-elven bard [[Solus vos Caen]] Designed to imprison creatures associated with [[Leviathan]] for study (attempting to break into the [[Allsong]]). Mostly unsuccessful. Encased in an oval magestone dome, the facility housed Solus, entertainment slaves, and imprisoned sea creatures and experimental subjects. The surrounding area was a town, dedicated to a minor [[Old Gods|goddess of song]].

During the [[War of Souls]], one of the enslaved residents sacrificed herself to [[concept bomb]] (invoking [[Broken Memory]]) the area and surrounding settlements. This was…partially successful. Solus himself survived mostly intact by calling on the [[Twisted]], becoming the Maestro. Many of the inhabitants were bereft of memory and song. The surroundings were mostly laid to waste; the inhabitants were driven mad.

It returned to normal space in 248 AC. Borrowed Song itself remains mostly dry but the area around it is flooded (depth about 80' max, 5' above the high point of BS). The former inhabitants, now twisted abominations (sea spawn + Deep scions), have adapted. They remember nothing about the past and seek to capture and corrupt anyone who enters the region.

In mid-249 AC, [[Crescent Dream]] arrived to contain the area. The Maestro reacted and lured most of them into a series of traps, capturing and corrupting many and killing/wounding others. Since then, CD has remained mostly to prevent the corruption from spreading.

In early 250 AC, [[Enigma]] cleansed the site, destroying the Maestro and freeing the remaining imprisoned creatures.

      <text bytes="2577" sha1="bp8nd4bkijvyn083aeprk5qoll7fmal" xml:space="preserve">The Crescent Dream is a warrior society of [[kalasaa]] sworn to [[Leviathan]]'s service (although [[Leviathan]] doesn't really care). They form part of the [[Great Northern Alliance]] of [[kalasaa]], [[weilgoroesi]], and [[ika ika]]. Their area of responsibility is the south western region of the Sea of Dreams.

Originally, their duties involved patrolling for twisted creatures, fighting corruption or incursions, and protecting the relics of the past as they're discovered by other GNA forces. From mid 249 AC through early spring of 250 AC, however, they were locked in a protracted struggle against [[Borrowed Song]]'s Maestro. This struggle killed or crippled many of them and corrupted many others, leaving them at a fraction of their original force. Since the cleansing of [[Borrowed Song]] by [[Enigma]], they have stayed put, awaiting reinforcements while supporting the village of [[Honedaxe]] in fulfillment of their pledge to the adventurers.

;Nominal Force Strength: 52 (3x16 + 4) combat effectives, 20 support personnel.
;Current (Spring Dying 17) Strength: 26 total combat personnel, 14 effective. 12 support personnel.

A variant of the basic [[udaaka]] bird/hobgoblin chimerae, the kaua lack the flight of the udaaka. Instead they have stronger bones and instinctive mimicry abilities that make them excellently suited to be messengers, recorders, and spies. 

Most of them can repeat any phrase they've heard at least once, exactly mimicking the voice of the speaker(s). Those with training and talent can reproduce entire conversations with multiple speakers. The kaua have leveraged this ability to achieve status higher than any of the other beast-born races in [[Kel'tan]] or their client states. The kaua live in large family groups called flights, each flight sworn to serve a landed pure-blood noble. No other may require their services. They serve as spies, assassins, secret police, and privy messengers for the nobles of [[Kel'tan]] and are considered unflaggingly loyal.

Very few kaua have ventured outside of the [[Solar Highlands]], and only two have made it to [[Noefra]] in recent history; the adventurer [[Crow]] and [[Ekek Caw]], intelligence officer in service to Phoenix Princess [[Princess Leina |Leina'lor'al'iera sur Kel'tan]].

Their final client was [[True Hold]]; their orders were to prevent a port from being constructed in [[Honedaxe]] without bloodshed and without drawing attention on [[True Hold]]. Destruction of property is fine, but they are to avoid killing innocents. They will break these orders to defend themselves from other adventurers if pressed, but will try to retreat outside of town first.

Members:
; Gunnloda Badmergh-Laav: Guunloda is the town priest (he replaced the original priest who had an unrelated accident; the Red Hand bought off the assigned priest). He's been stirring up discontent and subtly been impeding any search for the real culprits. He officially blames all the troubles on lack of faith. Although he's supposed to be a priest of the Four Seasons, he secretly worships [[Kela Loran]] (the Coinspinner). Of the group, he's the team mom. He and Aodh are married. Cynical and bitter.
; Aodh Laav-Badmergh: Aodh is the acting militia head and chief of the guards. She's been muddying the evidence and misdirecting search parties. She's got a temper and goes into rage in battle. She's direct and to the point. Of the three, she's the least evil.
; Quelanna il Amastacia: Quelanna is the trader's representative (or is really impersonating the real one). Her illusion magic is mostly used for defense and misdirection. She's also a talented forger. She's been forging orders and creating most of the disruption. Her status as a caster is not known--she doesn't cast in public. She's the face of the group. Hardened by life in [[Tarad'am]]. She uses sex as a weapon but is cold.

They are not responsible for the psychological effects (the lassitude) or the damage to nets and ships or the raids on caravans. They've been working to prevent inquiry into these, as it aids their cause anyway. They're aware of Joseph Wildwood and his [[Silver Raven]]s, but haven't made contact (preferring to keep their cover intact).

After being discovered in Honedaxe and forced to flee, Gunnloda and Aodh joined Joseph Wildwood in his attack on [[Baron Sumpter]] and were stopped and captured by [[Enigma]], who were coincidentally present at the time of the attack. They were executed for treason and murder. Quelanna did not participate in that event and is still on the lam, hiding from [[Serpentstrike]] enforcers.

Destroyed by [[Enigma]] in early 250 AC; Joseph was killed a few weeks later during his attack on [[Baron Sumpter]]'s mansion.

==Joseph Wildwood==
The illegitimate son of the prior Baron Sumpter, Joseph was responsible for the massive losses that forced his aging father to sell the lordship to pay (mainly through gambling, destruction of property, and sleeping with the wrong men's wives and daughters). Proud and contemptuous of everyone around him, he turned to banditry with funding from Baron Silverpeak, one of the current [[Baron Sumpter]]'s commercial rivals. Throughout, his goal was to retake the lordship, motivated mostly by hate of the current Baron.

After his crew was destroyed by [[Enigma]], he turned to [[Red Fang]] worship and was transformed into a werewolf in order to gain the strength to kill Baron Sumpter. His assault, in concert with elements of [[Red Hand]], was crushed and he was killed by [[Enigma]].

==Silver Raven==
They spent months raiding caravans, but intentionally avoided killing or injuring people by use of traps, wild animals, and other strategems. The intent was to appear like natural accidents. At its peak, the Silver Raven had 14 members. It was named for Joseph's prize possession, a magical figurine of a silver raven that could transform into an actual living raven for a short period of time, carrying messages and scouting. Its whereabouts are currently unknown, but likely Quelanna of the [[Red Hand]] has it. Or maybe it was sold to finance his transformation by the [[Red Fang]] cult.

      <text bytes="3501" sha1="1l1adk5j3ril84he9jm7f2naq4qutey" xml:space="preserve">An [[orcs|orc]] tribe native to northern [[Kotimaa]].

==Facts==
;Shaman: Gwen. Middle aged. Primary kami: animal. Eagle, Wolf, Boar. Very hippy.
;Core Guard:Cian (KEE-an), Adair, Beathan, Domnall
;Tribe size: ~150 total. 50 combat effectives.
;Homeland: About 100 mi NE of [[Godsfall]].

==Traditions==
The Grey Eagle claim to descend from a small group of pre-cataclysm orcs that decided to reject the warlike ways of their ancestors and seek harmony with nature. They were forced into service with the Army of Chaos as shamans and scouts and split into two groups. One, the shamanistic people and the noncombatants became the ancestors of the modern tribe, while the scouts and fighters disappeared from history while sweeping the Dreamwall for Order forces.

==Ancestors== 
A blend of a dozen tribes, hammered together after being "recruited" by the [[Hellcaller]] into the Army of Chaos immediately before the [[Cataclysm]]. Their chant: "Bas do Deithe, Bas do Maistri" (Death to gods, death to masters). Tired of fighting others' wars, tired of getting jerked around by powers. 

===Notable People===
;Warleader: Real name lost, forsaken after being coopted by the Nameless. Torn between being sick of fighting and enjoying the rush of the Rage. A controlled lycanthrope (werebear).
;Shaman Brigid: Wildfire druid. Serious temper (in the non-Rage sense) issue. Red haired. 
;Lugh the Unkillable: Oldest warrior (berserker). Said to be cursed with regeneration. Nice guy, if no fighting. Secretly (to outsiders) a werebear.
;Waerlock Bres: Half-orc. Fiend pact with Kelak'ilArunasura. Most bitter against the gods. Angry. Born of rape, mother was then (when he was 10) convicted of witchcraft by the priest of [[Old Gods|Pelear]] and burned at the stake. He escaped and sought out a pact.
;Scout-leader Kliodha: Female warrior/ranger. Quiet, cool-headed. Supports peace. Warleader's only daughter, the only other true Grey Eagle.
;Smith Goibniu: Also quartermaster. Sick of fighting. Considered wise.

===Groups===
* 30 scouts/skirmishers under Kliodha
* 15 heavy infantry under Warleader, with Lugh as sergeant.
* 15 support under Brigid

==True History and Settling Down==
In truth, the blood ties between the modern Grey Eagle and the Ancestors are...tenuous at best. The modern Grey Eagle trace their connection to Kitos, the brother of Warleader. But Kitos was exiled from the tribe for basically being a wimp. And the ancestors weren't all peaceful or anything--far from it. That's a myth that the Grey Eagle have constructed (based on the teachings of Kitos). But the Ancestors, now awoken from Rushing Water Cave (where they had been in stasis for 250 years), are tired and sick of bloodshed. The Ancestors aren't willing to walk, and don't have the supplies. They've settle down in the valley between [[Hope's End Pass]] and Black Bear passes, ranging into the surrounding mountains to the east (not the west). They will do one last service before settling down. On hearing that their "descendants" were maltreated by the Sin Eaters, they volunteered to help [[Morgan]] and sent most of the scouts with him to free his people from the [[Sin Eater]]s.

Warleader and Gobinu were present when [[Silver Raven| Joseph Wildwood]] attacked [[Baron Sumpter]]'s mansion and participated in the defense. For this service, the Ancestors were granted rights to the land between the passes, on condition that they protect caravans passing through, which they agreed to.

Protects a valley south of [[Honedaxe]] and has promised (due to the influence of [[Enigma]]) to act as a last-ditch protector of that village.

==Background==
Ancient mountain kami, incarnated after a plea (to anyone) by the ancestors of the Hidden Folk for protection from the Cataclysm. She vowed to protect them, turning the invading orcs (see [[Grey Eagle]]) into stone. Since then she's been worshipped by the Folk, although they don't know her true nature or the nature of the vow, as their protector and patron. Erected a veil around the valley. People can't see in (they see empty terrain instead) and those who enter except through the one pass in [[Rushing Water Cave]] have their memory stripped and wander around and back out. Within, all is at peace, including animals. The cost of this is growth. She enforces a mindset of passivity, because growth brings a desire to leave, and the outside is dangerous. As this is an external influence from birth, few realize it. But everyone does the bare minimum and mostly just sleeps. Or sits around telling ancient stories that haven't changed for generations. No new discoveries, only a bare minimum new kids to keep population stable (although it's slowly decreasing), etc. Recently, Aedron (founder of [[Honedaxe]] walked into Rushing Water Cave, driven to suicide by the collapse of his hopes and his bankruptcy. Before he could kill himself, Lascivia intervened and turned him to stone. Realizing that there were dangerous folks outside, she started to extend her aura to the north to "bring them into her peace". It hasn't worked.

[[Enigma]], seeking the source of the aura, found the cave, and negotiated the freedom of the Ancestors and Aedron. After also destroying the corruption at [[Borrowed Song]], she relented and released the town from her influence but promised to stand watch.

==Personality==
; Dominant concept: security
; Ideal: safety--anything is worth being safe from harm
; Bond: I promised to protect the Hidden Folk and so I will.
; Flaw: Doesn't understand mortality. Very possessive; accepts free will only if otherwise harm results (directly).
; Alignment: LG

From that point on, Tsun decided to stick with the party. The party realized that Tsun was a capable fighter, after the halfling crushed the kneecap of a bandit. From then on, Tsun became known for his tendency to break the kneecaps of his enemies.

Tsun hates being mistaken for a child or being called short, unless he can use it to his advantage (it is a lot of restraint though to not yell at the person). In most cases, he despises it when people call him short and takes extreme offense in it, often yelling at them. Still, he isn’t inherently violent unless provoked by someone or something.

Tsun is about 2.5 ft tall and is abnormally short, even for halfling standards. He is fairly slender, with blonde hair and blue eyes. He wears brighter colors and carries a shield that he uses to protect those he cares about. He also has a mastiff named Ebony, who he rides into battle.

Tsun is usually more timid in public and uncomfortable around crowds, especially with women. There are a very few women he actually likes, but he does not usually like women. In battle though, he is far more efficient and a bit brutal, preferring to kneecap those who anger him (especially if they call him short). He is very attached to the party and respects him.

Due to some recent events that happened, Tsun is having trouble with his faith in [[Sakara]]. He is unsure of what he wants as his destiny.

;Affiliation: [[Forever and Beyond]]
;Ideal: Freedom. Everyone should be free to follow their own pleasures, so long as said things do not harm others. People have the right of personal freedom and that right should be protected. As a Paladin, I want to establish a guide for people to follow this code and for a place where everyone, regardless of who they are, to be free and safe.
;Bond: Everything I do is for the common people. I want to set a way to guide them and for them to remain safe and free.
;Flaw: Tsun’s temper may definitely cause some problems. Especially when he is called ‘small’--it is usually an immediate reaction for him to lash out with at least words, if not physical violence.

      <text bytes="3112" sha1="ql9kbsjocgxldyw86snwcgns40kybrw" xml:space="preserve">Once a [[soul-forged]] working in the great forge of the Dawnspire, he was awakened early one morning. The [[Dawnspire]] morning prayers were interrupted by him, who quickly dispatched one of the Oathsworn, named Leon Corvax. Over the next year he faced scorn, then reluctance, and finally acceptance. He became a cleric after a particularly brutal training period. Some called him the "chosen" of [[Tor Elan]], due to his near immediate devotion and dedication to the Sun. 

Built many years prior to his awakening, he is precisely six feet tall. As a labor automaton, he is particularly burly with wide shoulders and relatively long arms. His metal skin is covered all over his body in the holy script of Tor Elan, having been etched into him similar to how other races get tattoos. His face though, is a mystery to all those who meet him. Only those at the dawnspire in the weeks following his awakening, and the ecclesiarch know how he looks. Recently, the forge master of the [[dawnspire]] added secure mounting points all across his body, allowing his plate armor to be modified and mounted to him more directly, like a second skin.

Until recently, Sargas was uncertain if Tor elan chose him or not. These fears were alleviated recently, after speaking with the ecclesiarch. Even more so was when he visited a seer, after being told about two of his party's experiences. A voice he believes to be [[Tor Elan]] himself spoke "His fate is mine" before the seer's visions were cut off completely. Sargas took the seers orb before leaving, as a memento.

Sargas has a tendency to take command of most situations, acting as the highest authority in the room. Only those of royalty, very very high ranking members of the churches, or leaders of the regions, are shown deference. He harbors a particular hatred for anything demonic in nature. 

Though he hides it, he is growing fond of those he has traveled with since leaving the dawnspire. Much of his time while the party sleeps, he dwells on coming up with what he has heard of as "nicknames" for his new friends.

;Personality : He's direct in his speech, with very little sense of humour due to 'growing up' in the [[Breath of the Sun]]. Takes much joy in claiming the heads of powerful adversaries, and gifting them to his god. With a special hook on his side, he hangs the (still dripping blood) heads on his hip until he can reach an altar to [[Tor Elan]].

;Ideals : Seeks to serve his god in all things, as well as expand the [[Breath of the Sun]] to become a major religious sect in the [[Federated Nations]] area.

;Bonds : His worship to his god is his life. He would never give up his weapon, nor remove his armor.  He feels a pull towards his fellow [[soul-forged]], and would seek to help any he crosses paths with. Though he has never spoken to another of the awakened, part of him looks forward to that day.

;Flaws : Rigid in his beliefs. Does not take kindly to his god or the [[Breath of the Sun]] being spoken of in a negative light.

;Alignment : Lawful Good, leaning LN (observed)

==Backstory==
Dil Husty grew up in the port town of [[Fuhino]] on the northern coast of the Serpent Sea.
She spent her youth fishing and sailing - and generally getting into mischief. Uncle Mikham, a tavern keeper, nurtured her musical talent, and, taught her a few arcane secrets and some lore.

Dil hired on as a lookout / deckhand on the good ship [[Windbreaker]], whose captain sometimes traded and sometimes raided. He styled himself a Gentleman of Fortune. She hoped one day to be a Lady of Fortune, but her career was interrupted during her twenty second summer. One night, after Windbreaker ended a raucous port visit to [[Tarad'am]], a notorious [[Ship Folk]] pirate ship called The [[Scarlet Pearl]] overtook and boarded them - putting all to the sword. She was the last one standing, beset by saber and dagger at the starboard rail. Unleashing her final arcane reserves in a burst of thunder, she went over the side rather than be taken and sold into slavery – as they had threatened to do to her.

She swam for her life. Two days later she washed ashore near [[O’pola]]. A pair of triton scouts had found her - a Surfacer - swimming out to sea under the moonlight. They guided her landward. Losing her shipmates – her second family – was devastating blow. Sitting on the focs'l of an evening, leading the rest of the crew in songs, was no longer possible. Afraid to bring trouble to her family she traveled north, away from the sea, earning room and board by performing at the odd tavern, or, by persuading folks to share their food with her in exchange for a story or song.

She joined a wagon caravan heading North. The caravan master wore a brooch on his cloak: the dragon-headed ouroboros, gold on black. He was recruiting in the name of [[Forever and Beyond]]. Arriving in [[Sheplyn]], she joined with [[Sargas of Tor-Elan]], [[Tsun Azur]], [[Crow]], and [[Morgan]] to help Lord Sumter sort out his problems in [[Honedaxe]], a seaside port town. It seemed like a good idea at the time. One day she’ll pay back the slavers who destroyed her ship and killed her shipmates. One day...

      <text bytes="1934" sha1="9j71bxmqu1wct9ge58fusi6a9garb4y" xml:space="preserve">The region of the [[Primal Sea]] bounded to the west by the [[Blood-thirst Wildlands]], to the north by the [[Jungle of Fangs]], to the south by [[Sentinel Island]] and to the east by [[Moon's Fall Vengeance]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Serpent-sea-small.webp|thumb|800x800px]]
The Serpent Sea is much shallower than the main [[Primal Sea]], averaging only 250 - 500 ft deep. East of Sentinel Island it drops off rapidly.

The prevailing current flows north past the Ortor Waste, around Sentinel Island, and rejoining a deep cold current heading SE in the adjoining primal sea. A small curl breaks off and heads up the West Moon Sea. The bore current formed east of Sentinel Island is extremely dangerous for ships, and only the great city-ships of the [[Ship Folk]] are comfortable in those waters.

== Bordering Nations ==
To the north of the Serpent Sea is the [[Serpent Dominion]], although the pirate state of [[Tarad'am]] occupies the prime port position on the sea. To the south lies the dissident fleet of the [[Ship Folk]], occupying [[Sentinel Island]]. To the west lies the unclaimed (by any nation, anyway) [[Blood-thirst Wildlands]]; to the east the foreboding and broken peninsula of [[Moon's Vengeance]], occupied by the mysterious [[goroesi]] and the freed slaves at [[Gor'ka]].

Various groups of folk inhabit the islands of the serpent sea, mostly [[ophidian]] and human, although the [[sena'ka]] have substantial influence and there are several [[Goblins|goblin]] tribes (especially on [[Sentinel Island]]).

== Climate ==
Located in the sub-tropics, the shallow Serpent Sea produces a very wet, humid, warm climate year round. Heavy, regular rainfall during the summer leads to severe storms in the late summer/early fall, including hurricanes. The spring and winter are cooler and drier, but still quite humid. For reference, think the area surrounding the Gulf of Mexico.

He vaguely remembers where he was from, and vague memories of serving...something and gaining his current abilities. After an amount of time he can't remember, he "woke up" on [[Noefra]] (near [[Godsfall]]) with no memories of his life, save for a locket with a rune carved into it. He wandered the continent for a few months before making his way to [[Honedaxe]] and meeting the rest of [[Enigma]] and helping them with their current job. Afterwards, he decided to stick around.

He likes his new friends, even though they confuse him quite often.

He has encountered a cat named She Who Talks From Peoples' Shadows ([[Shade]]) who tends to hide in his shadow (literally) and can speak to him. She claims to have met him quite a while ago (mentioning events more than 50 years ago) but is quite cryptic, as cats are wont to be.

Rune, despite his natural charisma, is horribly awkward in social situations. He doesn't talk much, and when he does it's usually fairly blunt. He's naturally curious and inquisitive, with a love of figuring things out. His curiosity has, and will, get him into serious trouble.

      <text bytes="7060" sha1="qqyrl28uejkj1hnug3d5v0xayr0whfj" xml:space="preserve">The dominant feature of the central [[Nocthian Caldera]], Mount Nyx rises roughly 4,500 feet above the central rolling plains of the Caldera floor. A volcano in its own right, Mount Nyx last erupted at the end of the First Interregnum, at the dawn of the Age of Men and Gods. Since then the mountain has remained quiet, mostly due to the restraining influence of the Nocthean clergy who occupied the Caldera throughout the 3rd Age. It became the center of the [[Hungering Frost]] and the lair of the dragon Sorrow-wing until her defeat at the hands of the [[Airship Pioneers]] and the Frost's collapse in late 211 AC. Only recently, with the retreat of the ice-cap, has the whole complex become accessible. Retaking it and rebuilding it is a major driving desire for the [[Church of Night Reborn]] and its clergy; this goal is contested by [[Wyrmhold]], who believes themselves the owners by right of conquest.

==Mount Nyx in the 3rd Age==
During the 3rd age, the Nocthan Caldera was home to the isolationist culture known as the Nocthians. Devout monotheistic worshipers of the goddess of night, mystery, secrets, and magic (specifically relating to magic items), Nocthis, the Nocthians were a unique ethnic group easily identified by their ice-pale skin that never tanned or burned in the sunlight and long, straight, night-black hair. They called this "night's blessing". Matriarchal and theocratic, they were ruled by the priestesses of Nocthis from their temple-fortress buried inside of Mount Nyx, located at the heart of the Caldera. Around the mountain and on its slopes they built the City of Night, Nykopis. Few outsiders ever saw more than the outskirts, as the Nocthians were not welcoming of outsiders.

Their isolation on the high plateau of the Caldera did not mean that Nocthians were unknown outside the Caldera. They routinely sent teams, led by a battle-priestess, to recover artifacts of power that threatened other areas. These they brought back to the temple, where they were sequestered and sealed away for eternity. To many citizens of the Western Empire (and later the successor states), the Nocthians were a bothersome group--ready to interfere in others' business but loath to allow interference in their own.

Yet all through this time, the Western Empire never attempted to conquer the Caldera. In fact, they took strong measures to prevent any interference. In return for this hands-off relationship, the Noctheans paid a nominal tribute of one daughter per generation as a bride for the Emperor at his ascension. This Bride of Night didn't stay in Imperial Center, however--after the wedding she returned home to her people and acted as ambassador for the Empire there.

Why was the Empire (normally so grasping and expansionist) so hands-off with the Nocthians? Some believe that Mount Nyx holds the answer. For it is a fact that the oldest records, dating back to pre-Empire times, state that the kami of Mount Nyx is Kubi, a fearsome, destructive, fox-tailed beast of lava and hatred, prone to sudden and violent eruptions that would darken the sky for days all across the western side of Noefra. Yet the last eruption dates from before the start of the Nocthian residence at Mount Nyx. Some believe that the ancient idiscovered a way to harness and contain Kubi; to threaten them would be to threaten a re-awakening of Kubi and his world-shaking anger.

Whatever the reason, the Nocthians lived a simple life throughout the 3rd age. Very few arcanists rose from among them and they were known not to use magic items themselves--they only acquired them to keep them out of "the wrong hands." This pattern continued even during the [[War of Souls]]. During this time they granted the newly-created dragonborn people a home at the east edge of the Caldera, a region that became known as Wyrmhold. This situation continued until the Cataclysm, although the Nocthians progressively withdrew from the rest of the world.

Throughout this whole age, the Noctheans continued to tunnel and mine out the inside of the mountain. Several key areas:

;The Burning Heart: Deep within the mountain is where Kubi is contained, along with a Lava Nexus. The elemental output of that nexus is funneled up and serves to power and heat the rest of Nykopis as well as the vaults and portals higher up.
;The Nighthold: Above the Burning Heart but still beneath the level of the outside ground, the Nighthold contains the relic vaults as well as the research, training, administrative, and record-keeping areas of the retrieval teams, and the portals (both local and interplanar) that the teams used to facilitate their divine mission.
;The Temple of Night: Located at ground level, this was the heart of Nocthean government and culture. Here they held their rituals (forbidden to outsiders) as well as had councils and trials and pronounced new legislation.
;Habitation warrens: Located in the cone of the mountain, this is where the bulk of the ranking priestesses and their families lived. Multiple smaller temple-caves also dotted the interior of the mountain.
;The Observatory: Located in the caldera of the mountain, this was a sacred space for the highest-ranked priestesses to observe the night sky and seek answers from their goddess.

==Mount Nyx after the Cataclysm==
The Nocthians left the Caldera after the Cataclysm and the death of their goddess (along with all the other gods). Their descendants, the Byssians, never speak of this time except as "the Exodus". No one (except likely the monks of the [[Home of the Elements]]) know why they did, but the fact of their departure is incontrovertible. But whatever the reason, they left the mountain and its precious contents behind. And still the mountain (and Kubi) slept. [[Wyrmhold]] still maintained their place on the edge of the Caldera, but was left alone.

Approximately 100 years later, a sudden frost sprang up. Coming, it seemed, from Mount Nyx, as if the mountain had erupted in ice and snow instead of fire and lava, it swept over the entire Caldera and down the pass to the north as a glacier. Out of that ice and snow came the [[Hungering Frost]], implacable, inscrutable, and deadly. It drove the dragonborn off the Caldera; only extreme sacrifice and constant vigilance allowed them to maintain a hold on the only pass to the east down toward [[Safehold]].

In 211 AC and early 212 AC, that changed. The [[Airship Pioneers]] took their newly-constructed airship on a daring raid that saw Sorrow-wing driven off and the massive inter-planar rift that powered the perpetual winter destroyed. Sometime later, the [[Wild Cards]] finished off the leadership elements of the [[Hungering Frost]] and took the fight to [[Isskap]], leading to her destruction and the final end to the frost.

Over the next 40 years, the mountain has mainly remained un-explored. Surrounded by the [[Cursed Fens]] and populated by the remnants of the [[barbegazi]] forces, it has withstood the efforts of several adventuring parties and other forces to penetrate its mystery.

An adventurer who was part of [[Enigma]] for their early journeys. Hailing from the [[Phoenix Empire]] (specifically the domain of [[Phoenix Princess Leina]]), he escaped and fled via [[Portal Network]] to the [[Great Rift]]. From there, after some incidents with local criminal networks, he fled to [[Noefra]] and linked up with [[Enigma]]. After the events of [[Sleeper's End]], he returned with the princess back to [[Soefra]] to work towards the freedom of his people.

In 251 AC after the fall of the [[Kel'tan|Kel'tan Emperor]], he took a larger role in the unfolding civil unrest.

The first law, written into the code of the [[Great Mechanism]] after the [[Dawn War]] is that of the inevitability of death. And beyond that, the connection between growth and death is assured:

    Those that cannot die, cannot live. Life is growth. Without the possibility of death, there is no growth.

This means that those who seek to avoid death and avoid risks grow slower, if at all. Immortal beings such as gods, demons, angels, and elementals hardly grow at all. Choosing to become undead (especially via lichdom or vampirism) stunts your growth. This also explains why adventurers, who risk everything continuously, grow so much faster...if they survive.

== Common ways people try to cheat death and their side effects ==
There are a few ways people try to cheat death. They break down into three big categories--those that seek immortal existence of the soul after death, those that seek immortal existence of the body without dying, and those that merely seek to prolong lifespan beyond the normal amount granted to mortals. None of them are without risk, even leaving aside drawing the attention of the [[Watcher]] or his [[Gleaner|Gleaners]].

=== Immortality after death ===

# Ascension. This involves becoming a being with a True Name instead of a Spark. Whether by transformation by elemental powers, adoption into a [[Diabolical Families|Diabolical Family]], or by being worshiped enough to become an [[Ascendant]] in your own right. The result of all of these is that you give up your independence of soul and potential for growth--beings with True Names cannot grow beyond their names of their own accord. Who they are is defined by that Name. And in large part by how and where you get your energy. An Ascendant whose worshipers focus on the martial aspect will find themselves becoming more martially-oriented, for example.
# Demonification. Taking and trapping a [[jotnar]] in your soul. Side effects include not being welcome outside the [[Abyss]] anymore unless summoned. And having to eat souls to survive. Growth is limited to what you can derive from what you consume--you '''are''' what you eat. 

=== Bodily Immortality ===
These tend to revolve around undeath or transformations of self.

# Embedding yourself into an object. This is basically ascension, but of the [[kami]] variety. Works...but not forever.
# Tying your soul to a kami/fey. Also not permanent, and tends to lock you in place. You also take on traits of that being, becoming less and less human.
# Vampire rebirth. Technically you die. But you're still walking around. Vulnerability to sunlight, wooden stakes, garlic, running water, all the usual downsides. Plus the bloodlust that grows until it swamps your being in a red tide.
# Lichification. More cerebral and controlled than vampiric transformations, but a dead end. Sure, you can learn. But only what others have written--you'll never discover another fact on your own. Or grow stronger (in terms of spell circles, et al). Plus the feeding necessity so the [[jotnar]] doesn't consume you too.

=== Antigeria treatments ===
These aren't intended to last forever...on a single charge. Most of them are just fine, unless repeatedly used. All of them suffer from diminishing returns--the more you use any given treatment, the less time it buys you. And all of them result in diminished drive to create and grow.

# Cloning (via ''clone'', the spell, or other means). It's always you. But never younger than you were when you took the sample. Also, senescence tends to build up as pieces of the soul don't properly transfer. Especially when you died at extreme age. While the processor is younger, the software is old and crufty. One use, fine, especially if it's for emergencies (ie a drive-by stabbing). By about 5 uses you're seeing significant effects. More than that and the clones start aging rapidly.
# Blood magic (short of outright demonic possession, usually in the form of bathing or imbibing in the vital fluids/anima of other beings). Withers the soul. Sure, your body stays healthy. But you start taking on pieces of the lives/souls/minds of the people who died for you. Requires a strong will to not go insane, usually of the cackling villain route.
# Alchemical treatments. Herbs and such, properly treated, can keep you appearing young for a long time and even extend your life. Unlike most, this only has the usual diminishing returns issue. Most who use it only slow their aging, not reverse it, which means they end up looking old but acting young, and only for a relatively short time (~20% additional lifespan).

Formed when [[Maeva|Maevea]] and her age-lost love, [[Archdruid Kantorell]] were reunited after the events of [[Redeeming the Lost (Campaign)]] and the battlefield was cleansed. Maeve and Kantorell caused trees to grow up, turning what was hill and grassland tainted by undeath and magic into a lush tangle of forest almost overnight.

Of the groves of [[Noefra]], Pactum is the one least involved with politics. In fact, druids of that grove generally dislike civilization and work to temper its effects.

Born Jared of [[Baile Craan]], son of a merchant family there, he developed a mechanism (partially magical in nature) that allowed a much smoother ride for carriages and wagons. Leveraging the wealth this invention provided, he started the Fast Hands courier service with a few other notables. This service provides fast transport across the [[Sea of Grass]], running 24 hours a day between waystops, carrying packages and passengers.

Currently a man in his early 30s, he married Lady Eliza of Montdenaxe, a younger woman of about 18, about two years ago. Their marriage is happy, although Jared is often more concerned with his books and accounts than his beautiful wife. Which causes tension in their marriage. So far they have no children (although not for lack of trying).

He bought the Barony of Sumpter, covering the [[Cragdale]] and [[Honedaxe]] region, from the previous Baron (who sold it to pay debts incurred by his son, Joseph Wildwood) in 249 AC and immediately began his ongoing attempt to turn [[Honedaxe]] into a commercial port. This was stymied until [[Enigma]] arrived and solved the multitude of issues during the [[Axe and Song]] campaign. They also coincidentally saved his life from Joseph Wildwood and the [[Red Hand]] adventuring team a few weeks later.

==Personality==
Driven and mercantile. Much better with things and money than with people.

; Ideal : Efficiency.
; Bond : My businesses are my life.
; Flaw : Often disregards the human element.
; Alignment : Lawful Neutral.

==Location==
Considered the boundary between Eastern and Western [[Noefra]], the peninsula known as MFV is located south of the Ringwall mountains, east of the [[Jungle of Fangs]], and west of the enigmatic [[Dragonreach]]. Approachable overland via a narrow neck of volcanic ground, and with the western [[Moon Sea]] being known for treacherous currents and glass storms, very few have visited the area since the [[Cataclysm]].

==Terrain==
The surface of MFV is largely covered by sheets and fragments of black glass, formed ages ago at [[Moon's Fall]] by the interaction of the impact of the fallen moon and the arcane weapons used to attempt to deflect it. What life there is exists in the cracks, ravines, and underground caves. A few areas around the perimeter have healed, mainly due to the dedicated effort of [[goroesi]] groups. But their efforts are limited in scope. Further inland, the damage gets worse and only the deep caverns hold sane life. A spine of mountains and volcanoes extends down the center of the peninsula, and other volcanic areas dot the land

The whole area is heavily under the influence of the [[Plane of Lava]] as well as wild magic and extensive pockets of demonic influence.

==Notable Places==
; The MFV [[Tower of Trials]] : Located about a day from [[Yondar]] near the main tunnel route back toward [[Oldhome]]. 
; [[Yondar]] : An encampment/village of archonic [[goroesi]] on the north west coast, dedicated to healing the land.
; [[Zandak]] : A village of non-archonic [[goroesi]] on the north-western coast near the main spine. Known for being dedicated to strength and not belonging to the community of seers.
; [[Gor'ka]] : A colony of pirates located on the western shore.
; [[Oldhome]] : The central city of the archonic [[goroesi]], located deep under the central mountain range.

A product of the enigmatic [[Builders]] back in the First Age, its insides are not in the same place as the outsides. Instead, they stretch throughout the planes linked by permanent gates. The spirit of the tower tests all that enter, rewarding those that survive with power and wealth. It is said that there are multiple of these towers...but maybe there is only one tower with multiple entrances. Whatever the case, no person, having passed or failed (but survived) the test of the tower can re-enter from that same entrance.

==Trials==
The first set of trials consists of two parts, each with four sub-trials.

===Trial of the Mind===
Puzzles, lore tests, and finally a test of purpose.

===Trial of the Body===
Four trials, one associated with each element. Many are combat.

      <text bytes="2976" sha1="nyfkitay9zv5sc1doaiqaes3ay7h4ez" xml:space="preserve">The Yondri are a small, reclusive group of [[goroesi]] living on the northern edge of the western bulge of [[Moon's Fall Vengeance]]. While they have contacts with [[Zandak]] and with [[Oldhome]], they generally do not interact with the other populations of the peninsula. They settled at the place they call Yondar about 3 generations ago (~190 AC)

==Demographic information==
;Total population: 52 (26 male, 26 female)
;Adults:
* 7 shamans (druid-esque) + 1 Head Shaman (Belkan) (6M/2F)
* 3 wizards (Divination + Abjuration) (3F)
* 10 warriors + 1 warleader (Kay) (3 M/7+1F)
* 18 others (11 M/7 F)
; Children:
* 12 total, including Ilsa (6M/6F)
* Ilsa the Seer
** Age 14, 2 years a seer
** Blind (tradeoff for seer-hood)
** Tries to be adult and sophisticated/mystical. Really torn between wanting boys and nice clothes and her duties as seer. Serious but sometimes silly. Basically a normal 14-year old girl with way too much responsibility on her shoulders.

==Society==
Egalitarian (unlike most [[goroesi]]). Very mystical and obscure.  All adults have alternate names; kids dispose of their child-names once they become adult (Ilsa is a child-name). They live simple, agricultural lives, growing mostly vegetables and simple plants. They raise chickens and have a small spider-silk farm. The warriors hunt mage-beasts and other monstrosities that threaten the land. The shamans and wizards seek to repair the damage caused by [[Moon's Fall]] and the ongoing contamination by unchecked magic. This includes sealing or destroying elemental and shadow rifts, destroying demonic relics, and placating raging kami, driven mad by the tides of wild arcana.

==The Shadow Prophecy==
About 40 years ago, under Seer Sel'ith (2 seers before Ilsa), a series of prophetic visions started. They described 5 people who would "come out of many nations" and "face power bound yet unchecked." These visions predict a set of possible futures.
# One in which the group would "face the sleeper beneath the restless earth" and lay it to eternal rest. This leads to a healing of a large chunk of the land.
# One in which the group seals the sleeper away again, but does not destroy it. Effectively Status Quo minus the vampirates.
# One in which the group surrenders to the sleeper, fails in their task, or otherwise lets the sleeper awaken and break his chains. Bad things.
# One (optional) future where they "climb the steps of Trial" and gain power. Or fail (which can lead to 3).

===People Described===
# Dyurhal : "Shining like sun on steel" --&gt; Glitterboy --&gt; "Cheerbringer"
# Cysghul : "Watching [from/over] Shadow" --&gt; Tall, Dark, and Handsome --&gt; "Chatterbox"
#  Di  Ganwin : "Wrath of spring" --&gt; Kneecaps' Bane --&gt; "Little Giant"
# Dyal Tu'ul : "Dark Avenger" --&gt; Flightless Wonder --&gt; "Songbird"
# Caen I Mur : "Sea's Song" --&gt; Lady Dancer --&gt; "Straightface"

As of early summer 250, it is believed that these prophecies have been fulfilled by [[Enigma]].

Home to dozens of full-fledged druids and hundreds of acolytes, it is a sprawling expanse of wilderness, shrines, and hunting grounds.

One of the most political groves, the archdruid serves as one of the high judges of the nation, and druids and acolytes trained there serve as advisors and shamans throughout the nation. Politically, it takes a firm anti-industrialization, isolationist stance. Since the [[Caldera Conflict]], it has been most determinedly opposed to cooperation and trade with [[Wyrmhold]], considering them to be nature-destroying industrialists of the worst sort.

The monks trained here go throughout [[Byssia]], keeping the peace by acting as wandering police and investigators. They are known to be impartial; those that train at the monastery give up their families and heritage to join that fellowship.

A swampy land not much good for farming, the goblins here have taken to manufacturing (under the direction of Clan [[Byarsh]]) with a vengeance.

Byarmarsh borders on [[Byssia]] to the south and the [[Windwalker Confederacy]] to the east. For many reasons, this is an area of high international tension in all directions. The Byssians don't like the environmental degradation caused by Byarmarsh's industrial policy; the goblin tribes don't like incursions onto their lands from anyone, and Byarmarsh is desperate for the resources that are just out of sight in [[Byssia]] and the [[Blood-thirst Wildlands]] to the south east.

      <text bytes="9646" sha1="i3xkvp1ssy761tqutju8ga4w69y0okx" xml:space="preserve">''From the report of the [[Heroes of Pactum]], presented by [[Walker]] at a convention of scholars in 223 AC. The final section was added after the battlefield was liberated, but the tenses were not changed to reflect the passage of time.''

This was the site of the [[Battle of Acceptance]] that ended at the [[Cataclysm]]. This was the final battle of the [[Cataclysm War]], where the Armies of Order made their final stand against the Armies of Chaos. Creatures and armies from all over Quartus and the planes beyond met here in battle, and the losses were horrific. The battle lasted several days as the Armies of Order were pushed back toward the Mother Tree. The [[Nameless]] itself took the field on the last day, riding on its fell dracolich steed. The battle was lost…until the destruction of the [[Eyes of Qa'desh|Left Eye of Qa'desh]] sucked the anima out of the air and the dracolich fell from the sky.

In the aftermath, the surviving Orderites fled south, gathering the refugees from the catastrophic natural disaster unfolding, while the surviving Chaosites fled mostly north or were swept up in the changes and turned on each other. The least affected forces, those of the Fiendish Territories and the Angelic Hosts, were left to bury the dead (and not so dead) at the battle. They sealed all those things that do not lie quietly, along with artifacts and other powers, in the Pactum Battlefield.

Physically, the Pactum is set in a small valley between two large, rocky hills. To the South East on the hill there stands the remains of the Mother Tree, a huge oak that once held a major kami but now stands stark white, bleached of color and life. The kami has fled or died; no trace of it remains. This area is completely devoid of life except for a very small shoot of green on the Mother Tree—no plants will grow under the spreading branches and druidic/ranger spells cast here fail without trace. To the NW is the Blasted Hill—this hill is covered in weak spots. Walking here might drop you in a pit full of seething acid. Life grows here, but it’s sparse and twisted by the remains of demonic energies.

==Structure of the Pactum==
The center of the Pactum is the Great Barrow, a 50-foot high building of solid black stone. The area between this and the Inner Ring is hazy as seen from the outside due to the wards created by the Inner Ring. Surrounding this (about 10 feet from the Great Barrow at closest approach) are the four great mounds of the Inner Ring with a chest-high wall-mound connecting them in a diamond shape. Grass grows on these; each barrow is covered by wildflowers in all seasons. The Outer Ring of 8 smaller barrows, placed on a great circle, encompass this Inner Ring, with about another 100 feet of clearance. Four of these barrows are located at least partially on the surrounding hills. Between the Inner and Outer Ring are numerous small mass graves. Unlike the barrows, these do not have entrances and are simply earth and rocks piled on bodies.

[[File:PactumBattlefield.png|800px|Pactum Battlefield pre-cleansing]]

===The Great Barrow===
The Great Barrow is a trimmed-corner cube about 50’ on a side. It seems to be made out of solid, flawless obsidian, although a trace of a large doorway (15’ wide) seems etched on the SW corner.

Contained in the Great Barrow are the sleeping gold dragon [[Pigmeys Neryis]] and the remains of her mate, the dracolich [[Atijok]]. She sleeps restlessly, clutching the bones of Atijok, on a mound of treasures gathered from the demonic foe, treasures that have warped her very essence. Once a noble creature, she fought to free her mate from the Nameless’s domination but failed and refused to leave his side.

===Inner Courtyard===
Between the Great Barrow and the Inner Ring is an empty expanse (10’ minimum) of cracked &amp; shattered black glass. Touching the ground here is hazardous.

===Inner Ring/Flower Barrows===
The four Flower Barrows, made of earth over piled rocks, stand at the cardinal points. Between them is a chest-high (~4’ tall, 5’ wide) wall of packed earth. Grass grows up the outside of both barrows and wall, but stops dead at the peak, replaced by the same black glass as inside the Inner Courtyard. A major ward (in the shape of a cube) glitters in the air, projected by the barrows. Projectiles or creatures that touch this ward are violently repelled. Each Flower Barrow has a sunken door in the outer-most wall and the barrows are 15’ in diameter and 10’ tall.

The Barrows are marked (on the attached map) by the following indicators:
#. This barrow is covered by white iris flowers, edged in gold. Contains [[Titziba]], the Reprobi of Faith.
#. This barrow is covered by blue violets. Contains [[Tzeru]], the Reprobi of Hope.
#. This barrow is covered by orange forget-me-not flowers. Contains [[Milistiba]], the Reprobi of Love.
#. This barrow is covered by blood-red hyacinth flowers. Contains [[Patitziba]], the Reprobi of Patience.

===Outer Courtyard===
This grassy area, about 100 feet wide at narrowest, covers the space between the Inner Ring and the Outer Ring barrows. It includes a substantial part of the Blasted Hill. Dotting this area are smaller mass graves for the common soldiers who fell in the battle here. These are merely rock-and-earth-covered cairns of various sizes. Not all that were buried here were truly mortal; some of the graves contain bound creatures. 
The extremely powerful magic that was worked here (in battle, due to the [[Cataclysm]], and in the Acceptance ritual) disrupted the transition of the spirits of the fallen into [[Shadow]], binding fragments of their memories and personalities to their bodies; with no gods to bless the fallen, these fragments were interred with them. As a result, this area is permeated with memories of the fallen. Any being that enters must be shielded against possession, lest the spirits of the fallen take over their bodies and seek to re-enact their old lives. The Outer Ring serves as a containment ward for this influence; recent actions of the Chaos cult have breached this protection and amplified the influence of the dead memories into a cone about 60 miles wide and 60 miles long, pointed from Lesser Barrow 4 (#8) SSE to cover [[Innsmouth]]. This both weakens the effect (allowing a simple Wisdom save to resist the effects) and distracts attention from the goings-on at the battlefield.

The Sons of Dawn have been digging in the burial mounds here, looking for weapons and armor and artifacts. So far, they’ve found caches of mundane (but resistant to decay) chain, scale, and half-plate, as well as spearheads, sword blades, and arrowheads.

In order for the dead to lay peacefully, they need to be blessed. If a religious person (cleric or paladin) expends a spell slot in prayer (10 minute ritual), it will cleanse a section (~1/8 of the area / level of slot).

===Outer Ring===
The outer layer of wards emanates from these 8 Lesser Barrows. They are larger and lower than the Flower Barrows, standing about 4’ tall and measuring an oval shape about 25’x15’. There is a sunken door of stone on the inner short side of each barrow, with steps leading downward. The long sides face radially outward from the Great Barrow. These are grass-covered. Each Lesser Barrow contains the remains of one of the generals of both armies, buried along with their arms and armor, as well as some of their soldiers, bound in restless, deathly slumber. Not all these were human, nor are all of them dead, precisely.

The barrows form the anchor points for three large-area spells—an illusion of concealment, antipathy toward humanoids &amp; beasts (effective out to a half-mile radius), and containment for the restless dead in the Outer Courtyard. Currently the antipathy spell is disrupted by Chaos cult machinations while the containment is breached and focused outward. The concealment is still in effect (an “invisible box” illusion spell). 
# &lt;li value="5"&gt;NW barrow, under Blasted Hill. Shtryrm, [[jazuu]] warlord of Chaos Army. Dead.&lt;/li&gt;
# W barrow. [[Dhu'gula]]. Undead. Wizard General of Chaos army. Not quite dead. Beloved of [[Milistiba]]. Contains his living spell-book/phylactery The [[Book Bound in Pale Leather]].
# SW barrow. Demon, serving as power source for cult amplification ritual. Not original occupant—that was a human priest. Guarded by Sons of Dawn Elite Fanatics. 
# S barrow.  Nairyo Sangha, female angel.
# SE barrow. An empty tomb, with an illusion covering a tunnel into the hill. Pale tree roots have torn up the floor, roof, and walls. Formerly the tomb of the [[Archdruid Kantorell]] of the Army of Order, killed in that battle.
# E barrow. Supay, devil of Barong. Content to stay where it is, unless it hears of demon worship. Lion-headed, pet celestial lions.
# NE barrow. Eaemhair (Evir) gro'Ulag. Orc Shaman, army of chaos. Dead. 
# N barrow. Kheshm, devil of Angra Manyu. Now diminished to a Tanarukk. Hostile.

==Current State==
After the cleansing of the battlefield as part of [[Redeeming the Lost (Campaign)]], the fey known as [[Maeva]], formerly the kami of the Mother Tree, received her heart's desire with the miraculous resurrection of Kantorell, her lover. Together, they grew the [[Pactum Grove]] over the site, preventing anything still buried there from every threatening the world again.

[[Atijok]] and [[Pigmeys Neryis]] are currently living in [[Soefra]] with [[Wukong]].

[[Walker]], [[Dhu'gula]], and [[Milistiba]] are currently wandering the world seeking knowledge. Mostly headed east.

Dates: Mid summer 210 AC.

==Adventure in Innsmouth==
Originally contracted by concerned citizens in a village south-east of [[Innsmouth]] to investigate why a trader had come back from that isolated (at the time) sheep-herding village babbling all sorts of crazy talk. They arrived in [[Innsmouth]] to find the citizens constructing a heavy wall and beliving themselves to be preparing for "the final days" as if it was before the [[Cataclysm War]]. Not only that, but all the people were mixed up--the ostensible "mayor" was the 12-year-old son of one of the village farmers. While there was a weird memory effect going on, it shouldn't have been that bad.

Until they discovered that an envy hag had been posing as a beautiful woman and feeding the townsfolk a will-suppressant, leading to them becoming possessed by ghostly echoes of memory streaming out of a nearby battlefield. She had been contracted to do so to draw attention away from the events at the battlefield. After suppressing her, they journeyed onward to the [[Pactum Battlefield]].

==Cleansing of the Battlefield==
When the [[Heroes of Pactum]] arrived (after dealing with the hag causing trouble at [[Innsmouth]] and drawn by the strange possession effect that had taken the people there), the [[Sons of Dawn]] were digging in the Outer Court, looking for artifacts. This was under the influence of the Jester Cult, led by a cultist named Sarah. The Sons did not know that they were being influenced. Also present were two mercenary groups--one made up of bandits and the other a group of "civilized" orcs. The end goal was to overthrow the Council government of the area and proclaim independence. The cultists' goal was to cause chaos and get lots of people killed and release fell forces.

The party joined the band of bandits under the guise of being free-lance mercenaries and set about investigating the battlefield (after tricking the Sons of Dawn into giving them talismans to avoid the worst effect of the swirling souls inside the Outer Court. They opened and cleared barrows 5, 6, and 8. This disturbance weakened the wards and resulted in an army of undead attacking the camp, which they repelled and in doing so blew their cover.

They then attempted barrow 9, where [[Maeva]] soundly repelled them. After retreating hastily, they met [[Kai the Lost]], an exiled [[cysgor]] who joined their efforts (or mostly tagged along). During that day, [[Walker]], [[Wukong]], and [[Kai the Lost|Kai]] went into the battlefield to gather information. There they became suspicious of Sarah and gained information about the inhabitants of the barrows from [[Dhu'gula]]. During this time, Gale stayed to train with the orcish mercenaries and gained their trust.

Soon after, the [[Sons of Dawn]] decided that they'd found enough and set out to confront the Kingsmen (those that they believed were working to impose a monarchy on the area). The party then opened barrows 11 and 12. As this brought the field density too low, they then had to rush to cleanse the Outer Court lest the whole assemblage of restless undead awake. While they were doing this, cultists attacked and were repelled. 

The orcish mercenaries, being made aware of the cultist infiltration, gained permission to act as a rearguard (but didn't actually move). They served to protect the area from any hostiles while the party entered the Flower Barrows.

Inside the barrows, they first encountered [[Patitziba]]'s pocket realm in the [[Plane of Stone]]. Here they persuaded that engineer to grant them a "back door" into any one of the other three realms, bypassing the defenses. This they used to confront [[Titziba]] in his pocket of the [[Abyss]] and defeat him, reclaiming the soul of [[Pigmeys Neryis]], which he had held in an attempt to corrupt that noble creature. They then approached [[Milistiba]], asleep in the Dreamlands of [[Shadow]], waiting for her love [[Dhu'gula]] to come and claim her (sleeping beauty style). Here they allowed that lich to temporarily possess [[Walker]] via the [[Book Bound in Pale Leather]] and coached him through confessing his "love" to the fey creature (despite not really understanding what love is). With their help, they then confronted [[Tzeru]] in a pocket in the [[Astral]] and stole [[Atijok]]'s phylactery gem from her, escaping before she could bring her full wrath to bear.

Back in the material plane, the Great Barrow opened, revealing the great gold dragon wrapped around the bones of her beloved. In recognition of their efforts, an avatar of [[Melara]] descended and offered a mercy--a chance to restore [[Atijok]] to his prior state before (unwillingly) becoming a dracolich. This was opposed by [[Tzeru]] and [[Maeva]], each of which wanted the dragon to suffer eternally. Instead, the party chose to resurrect [[Archdruid Kantorell]], making [[Maeva]] happy. [[Tzeru]] was chased off (to be finally defeated and destroyed by the [[Wild Cards]]). Atijok was restored to existence as a dracolich.

Flying on the dragons, the party then confronted the [[Sons of Dawn]] and the [[Kingsmen]] and shattered their formations through sheer intimidation (with only one casualty, an idiot among the Kingsmen who shot an arrow at the dragons and got obliterated in exchange).

Located at the center of the Astral Plane, contiguous with Eua (the sun) and the source of it's radiance, the [[Celestial City]] is the home base of the 1st Host and the center point of the Great Mechanism. It is composed of four separate zones, each with a separate purpose. These four zones are connected by portal networks, although most of the denizens here can fly under their own power.

=== The World Core ===
The Celestial City is at the center of the Dream. As such space is oddly distorted, especially near the World Core. Up and down are strange--no matter your orientation around the parts of the Core, the rest of the city is always above you. The whole city is sheathed in about a mile (from the closest obstruction) of breathable, flyable air (really anima that behaves like air). Once you leave that bubble gravity no longer applies. Within that bubble, things are drawn to the plane of the World Core. If you were to fall, you'd yo-yo back and forth, eventually (slowly) coming to a rest on the level of the Core.

[[File:World-Core-small.png|thumb|200px|The World Core]]

About two miles across and one mile wide, the World Core is the heart of the Great Mechanism. Made out of a material that appears to be brass, but is much more resistant to attack, it controls the power that keeps the entire Dream functioning. Two vortexes of anima spiral into the central segment--one from above and one from below. These vortexes glow with a steady light and provide the lighting for the entire Celestial City. Each of the circular structures is actually spherical--like beads strung onto a circular wire. The outer layer of each sphere is uneven--some are filigree, others are covered in gears that occasionally spin and move. The beads are hollow--the laborers that maintain the World Core work and live in them. The rings are gigantic conduits 64 feet in diameter; through them pulse terawatts of power. The entire core revolves slowly around the axis of the vortexes, exactly matching the rotation of Eua itself, revolving once every month.

The central pod is different from the rest--the outer surface is made of overlapping disks set edgewise into the surface of a smaller sphere. Those disks spiral upward and downward--at the very top and bottom are obelisk-like pylons that catch the anima from the vortexes and channel it into the core. Scholars believe that at the center of that pod is the Heart itself with the Divine Four fused into it. Only the Congregation has access, and then only on command.

=== The Machinarium ===
The closest area of the City to the World Core, the [[Machinarium]] holds the forges, production facilities, and workshops of the 4th legion of the 1st Host. A spherical volume covered in buildings and chasms, it is home to the millions of devils belonging to the Territory of Thoraz as well. From here, portals link to the Host's outposts throughout the Dream and to the Elemental Planes of Fire and Earth for each of the planets. It is said that the entire area is one gigantic machine--it is certain that it rearranges itself from time to time.

=== The Laboratorium ===
Home to the research facilities and testing grounds for the 3rd legion of the 1st host, the [[Laboratorium]] lies on an oblong disk positioned on a level with the Machinarium but directly on opposite sides of the Core. Very few beings willingly go here--even fewer return. 

=== The [[Field of Ardor]] ===
This is the furthest area of the City from the Core--it is also the largest. A disk 64 miles wide with a hole in it for the central vortex, it is the only part of the city not entirely covered in buildings. The Field houses the Well of Souls (the place of rebirth for the angelic Hosts) as well as the headquarters for the 1st Legion of the 1st Host and the 4th legion of the 4th Host. Newly-reborn angels are trained here and the senior angels have their estates here as well.

      <text bytes="1600" sha1="e4l4waiovlzq818gg4674wl88q28iy6" xml:space="preserve">A lone, low mountain peak rising out of the [[Great Eastern Dustlands]]. Located about about 250 miles north-west of [[Shaadval]], it is considered holy to the [[Dead Walker]]s, a tribe of the Dust. Scattered histories record that it was the site of both the beginning and the end of the [[War of Blood]], being the birthplace of [[Red Fang|Gromach]] and his twin as well as the site of [[Red Fang|Serak]]'s death in the fortress built there. It is also the site of the first [[cysgoroesi]] fortress monastery to fall.

The mountain's peak (rising about 1500 feet off the surrounding terrain) is an intensely cursed site, where the boundaries between the Mortal plane, [[Shadow]], and the [[Abyss]] are very thin. Overlapping there are layers of reality. Even the [[Dead Walker]]s dare not get too close--they practice their holy blood rites down near the base of the mountain.

== Post 250 Status ==
In late summer 250 AC, an [[Enigma|unknown event]] (seriously, it's a mystery. No one knows why. Really.) caused the mountain to abruptly collapse. And by "collapse", you should read "implode into itself until there's nothing but a still-smoking hole in the ground several thousand feet deep". Simultaneously, [[Lyo Duo]] in [[Shadow]] collapsed. At the time of collapse, many, if not most, of the [[Dead Walkers]] were encamped at the base of the peak and were caught up in the dramatic inversion of the mountain and vanished. Also attendant to this event were earthquakes felt as far as [[Shinevog]], with aftershocks felt for several days and a huge plume of smoke and dust.

      <text bytes="1690" sha1="eaefhapc6yvl6lonc4pbl1fpfa0solb" xml:space="preserve">The event marking the end of the [[Ages of the World|Interregnum]] and the start of the Third Age was the War of Blood. This started when a demon-serving hag sacrificed two twins to create daemonhosts. But the twins, [[Red Fang|Gromach and Serak]] survived and thrived. Gromach mastered the [[jotnar]] and used its power to gather all the local tribes as well as many surrounding tribes and wage war against all the "civilized" peoples (of all races). This war of tyranny, bloodshed, and demonic rage lasted nearly 50 years and Gromach's empire covered much of eastern [[Noefra]] and as far west as what is now [[Rauviz]].

This war also spilled over into [[Shadow]], where pockets of the [[Waste]] grew (especially around the empire). The fortress monastery at [[Lyo Duo]] (lioh du'oh) fell early on to demonic influence, which drove the [[cysgoroesi]] from the battle lines and lead to the breaking of the [[Pact with Death]]. Much of the [[Waste]] results from this. As does the [[Great Eastern Dustlands]]--the land is poisoned by the demonic energies unleashed even in the present, more than 2000 years later.

Only the quest of the [[First Heroes]] to the [[Eternal Library]], where they enacted the Third Wish (bringing forth the [[Old Gods]]), enabled a change. The surviving [[First Heroes]] struck at the fortress at [[Mt. Fearg]], killing Serak and breaking the demon-link and (eventually) banishing the [[Red Fang]] (who Gromach had become after surrendering to the [[jotnar]] in despair over losing his sister) to the [[Abyss]].

The total death toll of this war is incalculable, but sages of the Old Empire estimated it at multiple millions.

      <text bytes="3466" sha1="8k46vbinefkuynxsewx1lbjjc7o7oax" xml:space="preserve">At the dawn of the [[Cysgoroesi]] race, the first Septarchs made a bargain with the [[Watcher|Watcher at the Gates of Infinity]]. They bound themselves and their descendants through eternity to watch over [[Shadow]] and especially keep the spirits of the dead safe from harm. This included especially demonic activity. In exchange, they would be unaffected by the normal effects of the [[Shadow]] and would have significant (local) control over its manifestations. This they used to create the [[Portal Network]] (among other things) and flourish.

As part of the pact, three great artifacts were granted to the [[Cysgor]] Septarchs:

* The [[Ebony Rod]], with power over the physical makeup of [[Shadow]], capable of manipulating the layers themselves.
* The [[Soul's Stillness]], a harp with power over the living souls as well as over the spirits of the dead. It's purpose was multi-fold--its power kept the peace among the fractious septs while it also served to guide the souls of the dead to the Gates, protecting them from demonic influence. The harp came from [[Leviathan]]; in exchange the Owls were to watch and report all things concerning the plane to that entity.
* The [[Heart of Iska kel Pana]], being a fragment of the [[Watcher]]'s mate, serving to shield the [[Cysgor]] from the debilitating effects of [[Shadow]] and provide a link to the [[Watcher]] and [[Leviathan]]

But at the end of the [[Ages of the World|Interregnum]], a major demonic incursion happened (the birth of the [[Red Fang]]) during the [[War of Blood]]. As the Waste started to spread, the [[Gleaner]]s of the time called on the [[cysgoroesi|cysgor]] of the time for aid. But they refused out of fear, having just lost one of their own monasteries (the great fortress at [[Lyo Duo]]), and sought a separate peace via [[Oro-laen]], being taught the ways of soul manipulation (enabling the shadesteel golems) in exchange for non-interference. Most of the gleaner bloodlines were lost in that war. Enraged and with the Heart, Harp, and Rod lost, the [[Watcher]] declared the bargain annulled. The cysgor lost most of their control over [[Shadow]]. In addition, bereft of the protection of the Heart and Harp and without the full power of the Rod, they started a slow decline. Now those who spend time in the monasteries are less and less fertile, and the ones left behind are weaker and weaker. If they don't completely abandon the [[Shadow]] or find a way of reconciling with the Watcher (or help someone defeat him), they'll go extinct in the next several generations.

This knowledge is strictly controlled. Only abbot-rank cysgor know any of it, and they only know the self-serving, heavily doctored version that blames the scythes. Currently, the only places the truth is recorded are
* Among the few remaining [[gleaner]]s (and especially their cats). And they're not talking.
* The [[Watcher]] itself. Neither is he.
* The records of [[Creche Skeud]]. Abbot Kaga learned it, which drove him insane and sparked the whole process that led to that Creche being abandoned and destroyed.

=== Post 250 AC ===
[[Enigma]] uncovered the truth of the Pact and ended up restoring two of the three artifacts--the Heart was forever lost in the process of freeing it from demonic corruption--to the Septs. The [[Watcher]] has re-affirmed the Pact, at least in part. This has stabilized their decline, but their numbers remain small.

The direct agents of the Watcher in the mortal realm. Where the [[cysgoroesi]] watched over shadow itself, the scythes were hunters of those that fell through the cracks of the First Law. They specialized in hunting down immortality seekers, lost souls, and others who should have died but hadn't. They are accompanied by a bonded psychopomp cat. The cats form a network via means not specified. Each scythe has an individual sigil and leaves a calling card (individually designed) at the site of any gleaning effort. 

Chosen from mortal bloodlines touched by [[Shadow]], this was a family affair. And they never were too numerous--only a thousand or so at their peak. After the [[War of Blood]] only three bloodlines remained. That of al'Tor, Sarad'or, and Mephak. And since then, the bloodline has thinned.

Currently there are three active al'Tor scythes, with a few viable candidates.
# [[Ios al'Tor]]. Responsible for West Noefra
# Porala al'Tor. Covers East Noefra.
# [[Rune]] al'Tor. Newly chosen. Partnered with [[Shade]].

==Qualifications==
* The candidate must not have any conflicting loyalties. Scythes are the ultimate in free agents, responsible only to the Watcher.
* The candidate must not be seeking for power.
* The candidate must discover their existence and role themselves, they can't be actively recruited. Someone can guide them, but they have to take those steps themselves.
* The candidate must have been chosen by the Watcher, either personally or bloodline.

      <text bytes="6012" sha1="ohv2azb2gs0zal84pwgurfjnhju5fty" xml:space="preserve">Nestled in an oblong valley (roughly 1 mile by 2 miles) in the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] of central [[Noefra]], Creche Skeud was the youngest [[cysgoroesi]] creche. Founded only right before the beginning of the decline (caused by the breaking of the [[Pact with Death]]) of the [[cysgoroesi]] people at the start of the Third Age, it was inhabited and operational until the [[Cataclysm]]. At that point, machinations by the leadership (see "Descent into Madness") caused it to be abandoned by most of the people. For the next 210 years, the former leaders ran abhorrent experiments aimed at gaining bodily immortality. In 211 AC, the [[Wild Cards]] arrived seeking treasure (see "Demon's Fall"). About 20 years later, Abbot Kaga's paranoia caused him to imprison his remaining competitor, Researcher Teneg, and tear down most of the city. In mid-250 AC, [[Enigma]] arrived and completed the destruction by assisting Teneg in putting an end to the mad abbot's failsafe spells, triggered by his death at the hands of [[gleaner]] [[Ios al'Tor]] earlier that year.

==Founding==
* Founded in roughly 2600 BC.
* Dominated by Raven and Magpie septs.
* Transitioned to being primarily a research and scientific creche rather than a normal breeding/training ground. Especially interested in the design and strengthening of the soul magic involved in the production of shadesteel golems.
* Average population: ~10k

==Descent into Madness==
[[Cysgoroesi]] history records that the magical and planar disruptions of the [[Cataclysm]] caused volcanoes to erupt nearby, and the creche was abandoned. Since [[Shadow]], too, was unstable, the men, women and children had to flee overland through the only entrance. As far as anyone knows, the creche was lost under lava. But that was not, in fact, true.

That story was promulgated by three individuals in order to clear the way for them to continue highly unethical experiments. Those three were
; Abbot Kaga: At the time of the exodus, he was ancient already. Fearing death and having uncovered the secret shame of his people, he became paranoid and insane and was desperately searching for a way to avoid death.
; Head Researcher Teneg: Naive and focused on her research, Teneg was a young woman of exceptional intellect and mastery of soul magic. She had developed a method for transferring souls (stored in soul gems) into living bodies, and Kaga believed that, with further efforts, they could become immortal.
; Mairon the Fair: Ostensibly a soul harvested by the Ravens a century before, he was really [[Grand Sapientum Iorda]], now a demon in service to [[Oro-laen]]. He was the high mage of the Western Empire who developed the process to fuse draconic souls into unborn children, producing the dragonborn. He did not die in the [[War of Souls]] that resulted—his thoroughly corrupt soul was rescued by the White Skull and he apotheosized as a demon of significant power. Because of his dual nature, he is not truly trapped by the soul gems, nor is he subject to their constraints. He has spent the last few hundred years subtly sabotaging the research into creating proper vessels for Kaga and Teneg—instead, he wishes to create corruption-proof vessels that would allow demon souls to live on the Mortal plane and able to bring their full powers to bear without rejection by the plane (as is the normal case for demons). Super-human arrogance, genius-level intelligence, unparalleled knowledge of soul mechanics and a way with words mark this abyss-spawn.

==Demon's Fall==
The [[Wild Cards]] arrived on scene in 211 AC as part of [[Finding a Home (Campaign)]]. After fighting their way through the facility and befriending the discarded clones (as well as some of the rebellious shadesteel golems) outside, they discovered the demonic machinery that powered the [[Korvan-effect]] generator powering the experiments. They confronted Mairon and the other two with knowledge of his demonic nature. 

To maintain the charade of being human, he has only been able to feed off the edges of the pain and soul-death powering the Shadow-shield around the complex (to prevent anyone from looking for them. Unknown to him, the golem that is his transport had been subverted by Kaga; when his identity was revealed by the [[Wild Cards]], Kaga triggered the golem to crush his soul-gem housing. As a result, he was thrust howling back to the [[Abyss]], where he was consumed by the [[Oblivion Gate]].

Stunned by this, Kaga and Teneg agreed to find a different way of accomplishing their goal and allowed the discarded clones and those of the shadesteel who wished to leave. Kaga and Teneg cooperated...for a time. After about 20 years, Kaga overthrew Teneg and locked her in her private mindscape, a virtual world. According to Teneg, this was because she refused to restart the experiments (having been made aware of the cost). He then, in his madness, commanded the golems to tear down most of the city to make it "defensible" (in reality doing just the opposite).

==The End of Skeud==
On 3 Spring Dawning, 250 AC, [[Gleaner]] [[Ios al'Tor]] discovered that the facility was unguarded. He entered via [[Shadow]] portal and destroyed the soul gem housing Abbot Kaga's soul, and departed. Unknown to him, the abbot had left a failsafe dead-man switch spell (because he feared the golems turning on him). This locked them down, making them passive spectators and fuel sources for their own bodies and driving them completely mad. In this state, they roamed about destroying anything that reminded them of living beings.

In High Summer of that year, [[Enigma]], looking for information about the nature of [[Rune]] or his history, made their way to the Creche. They discovered Teneg and assisted her in shutting down the failsafe (and releasing the souls of all of the shadesteel golems to seek their final rest). This effort cost Teneg her own life due to the abbot's poisoned spell-work.

      <text bytes="3245" sha1="0r1ojtqgaodaa5jpazddtus5huna3v0" xml:space="preserve">Not literally the first heroic figures. The First Heroes of Humanity (to give them their full title) were a group of men and women during the [[War of Blood]] at the dawn of the Third Age (roughly 2500 BC). They were responsible for enacting the Third Wish; in doing so many of them ascended to become the first of the [[Old Gods]]. Only one, [[Aerlan Godspeaker]] survived the [[War of Blood]] in mortal form--he went on to found [[Divina Lux]] as the first High Priest.

==Traditional Breakdown==

The consensus of sages during the Third Age was that the number of the First Heroes was 8 at the beginning of their quest. This was more for metaphysical or numerological reasons than on any kind of evidence-based reason. The traditional account is that they started out as two of each of four races: [[humans]], [[gwerin]], [[ihmisi]], and [[dwarves]]. Some have gone beyond that and insisted that there were one male and one female of each of the races for reasons of religious symmetry, but that is disputed.

Using the list established by the Imperial College of History (ca 1250 BC), the eight were:

# [[Aerlan Godspeaker]]. Human male. Originally a warlock bound to an angel, later the focus of three of the [[Old Gods]].
# The Lost King. Human (presumed female). Presumed to be the one who actually enacted the Third Wish and was erased from history. Existence reconstructed, as no evidence remains.
# Narnii Khanah. Dwarf male. Martial. Became Pealar, [[Old Gods|god of sun, light, and law]].
# Bayarmaa Khanah. Dwarf female. Unknown. Died en route to the [[Eternal Library]].
# Tiosog il'Hoavath. Gwerin female. Mage. Became Mariolaeth, [[Old Gods|goddess of death and vengeance]].
# Rhys il'Torvalds. Gwerin male. Mage. Died after the ascension of the [[Old Gods]].
# Vihanta. Ihmisi male. Druid. Became the Tree Father, [[Old Gods|god of nature and life]].
# Johasi. Ihmisi female. Ranger. Died after the ascension of the [[Old Gods]].

==Events==
===Quest for the Eternal Library===
TODO
===Death of Serak===
The remaining members, now imbued with divine power and the faith of all the "civilized" peoples, struck against Grumach's fortress. Grumach himself was absent, but they managed to kill Serak, his twin and leave the fortress in ruins, with her violated body impaled on a stake "as a message." She transcended death and became the [[Old Gods|goddess of chaos and evil]], patron of the orcs, "wicked" goblins, and other monsters.

===Revenge of the Red Fang===
Giving into the demonic blood rage at long last, Gromach fully demonified and became the [[Red Fang]]. His counterstroke killed two of the three surviving heroes, but he was banished by [[Aerlan Godspeaker]] into the [[Abyss]]. His influence still lingers in the orcish rage, but with his fall his empire disintegrated and the "civilized" peoples scattered the wicked "monsters" to the corners of the earth. The [[Great Eastern Dustlands]] still bear the abyssal poison of his final rage, however.

===Aftermath===
[[Aerlan Godspeaker]] went on to found [[Divina Lux]] as a home for the worship and study of all the gods, even Serak. The [[Imperial Cult]] holds him as having ascended to godhood after that, but this is disputed.

Unique in that it has never been part of either of the two great empires of the Third Age, it is the [[Noefra]]n home of most dragons.

Only two regular nations exist here, that of [[Bel's Kush]] and the [[Rol'tor Free State]]. And the former is controlled by dragons, albeit very odd (for dragons) ones. Throughout the rest of the land are villages of various humanoids and occasional small cities and large towns. But generally the land is wild, with nomadic or pastoral tribes at most. Because the dragons who call it home only rarely like having masses of "civilized" humanoids around. Much of the area is harsh, with sandy and rocky deserts, badlands and other unforgiving terrain.

      <text bytes="2412" sha1="revg1zg6lxiqg19oh8dq2abes3ssmdz" xml:space="preserve">A fang-kin half elf 5'8" tall. He appears to be in his mid 20s, with dark black hair that grows like a lion's mane, and a tight black beard. His eyes are one of his most striking features, and almost immediately noticeable. They glow with the power of his very soul. His left eye is a bright white gold, while his right appears to be a sickly green. He appears to be very thin, with scars along his hands and arms.

Born to a minor noble house in the city of [[Asai'ka]], none knew the secret of his, nor his father's, true origins. Inheriting the celestial bloodline from his grandfather, he was naturally gifted with a powerful soul and the magic of the divine.  He began his travels to search for his missing father. Unfortunately, his search was cut short after being captured and sold into slavery. He spent years being forced to work for a group of pirates (the [[Gor'ka]]) on the shores of [[Moon's Fall Vengeance]]. He was later rescued by a group of heroes going by the name [[Enigma]], but not before suffering a terrible curse, that corrupts him during times of stress.

A diadem frames his forehead that holds his hair back from his face. He wears a form fitting top with intricate golden colored flame designs along a collar, black shoulders, and white around the chest and back. He wears the lower half of a robe and sash, continuing the golden flame-like designs around it. The lower layer is black, while the upper is white. With well made but simple leather boots to complete the outfit. On his left middle finger, he wears a ring with a red gem that gleams in the light while channeling magic. 

==Personality==
His personality shifts based on stress and corruption levels of his soul. Normally he is kindhearted and attentive to those in need. When the shift happens, he becomes arrogant, selfish, and cocky. For now, he is still beating his corrupted half and maintaining control.

;Ideal: I must find my father and grandfather, and find a way to break the curse I was tricked into. Until that day, I will help those in need.
;Bond: I was rescued by [[Enigma]], and will repay them for that by helping them.
;Flaw: I was tricked into a pact with a demon, corrupting my soul and losing control of myself in the process.

      <text bytes="3464" sha1="460uc0tvhvraod9gfsupzc2qe689t4c" xml:space="preserve">Adopted daughter of Isal [[Sat'psa Balin]], Isal Srey was the lowest-ranked member of the four serious contenders to Balin's throne as merely a khun. She ran a mercantile empire that reached all three districts and is starting to get involved with international trade. She, like Isal [[Sat'psa Dara]], was disliked by most, mostly for her calculating and grasping ways. Ruling has softened that, as the people have seen significant growth under her reign. She only cares about making more coin, and will stoop to nothing (or so the rumors go) to get that coin. She uses and discards people when they're no longer useful. On the flip side, she's pleasant to be around and does not worry about caste boundaries. Of the four, she has the least religious devotion, although she attends services to the [[Queen Ascendant]] because that's expected of someone of her station.

She was married (now widowed), but her husband is a non-entity who kept busy with the family business (keeping the books) until he died in 246 AC of a minor infection. They have 4 children, a pair of identical twin girls and two boys. She is known to have a rotating stable of boy-toys, usually commoners who she uses for a few years and then sends off with a bit of gold. They're known for being very handsome, well-muscled, and brainless. She never trusts them with any of her business secrets. They're pure arm (and bed) candy.

== Children ==

# Lai Roel Artist. Born early in their marriage, Lai Roel has no interest in ruling, money, or any such things. His interests revolve around creating "art" and finding new partners. He's extremely gay, of the bear sub-variety, and prefers younger effeminate men as partners. Known for providing illustrations for most of the most scandalous pornographic prints around.
# Isal [[Hvang Puo]], the elder twin girl, is her heir. She inherited her mother's hardness and business sense. She's married to a distant Sat'psa relative and minor noble, but spends most of her time in the palace where she runs the internal intelligence network and her mother's international mercantile empire.
# Isal Captain Hvang Pal, the younger twin girl, inherited her grandfather's military bent. She commands the military forces of the [[Serpent Dominion]] and is known for her indiscriminate taste in companionship (of any gender and race other than the [[Sena'ka]]) and her dislike of the [[Ship Folk]].
# Isal Sat'psa Fei, the youngest son, is the child of Srey's old age, born when his mother was 52. Son of one of her boy-toys, he inherited his father's good looks and apparent lack of brains. Not everyone's sure about that latter part, however. He's currently the [[Serpent Dominion]]'s most eligible batchelor, but he already has several children by various lovers, including a much-older high-ranking Isal (which caused quite a bit of scandal, as he was only 14 when the pregnancy was noticed). 

Demographic Information
An elderly (74) human woman, Srey has a hard, unlovely face and no feminine softness. Her hair is silver and her skin is very pale. Tall for a woman, she stands nearly 6'.

Personality: I don't part with my money easily and will haggle tirelessly to get the best deal possible.

Ideal: Greed. I'm only in it for the money.

Bond: My merchant house means everything to me.

Flaw: When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money.

Alignment: NE

      <text bytes="1987" sha1="2opzkcs5d0rblpmgvsdkylayhyt3ml2" xml:space="preserve">As a phra, Dara was the highest-ranking of the four contenders for the throne. He was the natural son of Isal Balin, but by a concubine. This lesser birth, plus his unfriendly mien have handicapped him--without these he probably would have been the acknowledged heir by now. Isal Dara owned the largest and richest mines in the Stone Throne, located in the north-east section of the Southern District, making him legitimately very wealthy. Known for being equally harsh on commoners, Lai, and Isal alike, he does not have very many friends. He believes strongly in laws and order and enforces them with little mercy or favoritism. He is known for having a violent temper and physically abusing servants (and his family) in fits of rage. He is prone to drinking, which does not make his temper any better.

He had five wives, the other four having died either in childbirth or (some whisper) from abuse. She was a young (17) when they married, quiet, mousy woman who keeps to herself and keeps the household functioning. He has 3 living children (two girls and a boy). The boy, Isal [[Sat'psa Daraal]] has taken his place as phra and follows in his father's footsteps.

==Demographic Information==

A human male, he was short (5'3") and very powerfully-built (unusually so for a Fang-kin). His hair was mostly silver, and he shows stark splotches along the back of his neck and spine when he got angry (which was frequently). An army veteran, he stayed in fighting shape until the end of his life. Mechanically, he is a Knight (MM), wielding a silvered great-sword that once belonged to his father. He died in 237 AC of a lung infection.

;Personality: I blow up at the slightest insult.
;Ideal: Fairness. No one should get preferential treatment before the law, and no one is above the law.
;Bond: My loyalty to my sovereign is unwavering.
;Flaw: Violence is my answer to almost any challenge.
;Alignment: LN (near the LE border).

      <text bytes="2142" sha1="h32mvswwz18pvizr7qvvybatyxbdgo3" xml:space="preserve">Isal Leng wielded his birth as the last son of Isal Balin by his first wife as a weapon in the interminable disputes about the succession. As a luang, he has become the largest land-owner in the Southern District, owning multiple villages across the southern portion of the district. His farms are not the most productive, and Isal Leng lives an extravagant lifestyle. He has long been in debt to money-lenders from the Central District. Over the last few months before the [[Devil's Rebellion]], however, he paid off most of his debts, reportedly in unminted bars of gold and in unworked gems. It was discovered that much of this wealth was being funneled to him via the devilish [[Red Lantern Society]] that owned him.

Jovial and pleasant to be around, he is popular among the lesser nobles and the Lai for his extravagant parties and lavish lifestyle. He ws married to his second wife (the first left him about 2 years ago due to debt issues), a beautiful young woman of about 20, daughter of a local khun. He only has one living child (by his first wife), a man of about 60 years who is serving in the military in the Northern District as an officer. They were estranged up until Leng's death, which ended the [[Devil's Rebellion]] and thus he escaped condemnation. He is still living in the northern territories.

==Demographic Information==
A human man in his early 40s, Isal Leng was a rarity among Fang-kin. He was fat. Standing about 5'9 and about 250 lbs, he was covered in rolls of fat that jiggle when he laughs (which is frequently). His hair is golden, and his nose is flushed from a life of drinking. Mechanically, he's a Noble (MM), but without the weapon proficiency.

;Personality: Nobody stays angry at me or around me for long, since I can defuse any amount of tension.
;Ideal: Power. I hope to one day rise to the top of my family and prove that I'm the best.
;Bond: I want my son to love me--I'll do this by being powerful.
;Flaw: I have an insatiable desire for carnal pleasures and parties.
;Alignment: LE (near the NE border)

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text bytes="4295" sha1="12plddxqdnvwupacucu4ari0c47hohz" xml:space="preserve">Isal Vanna was the youngest daughter of Isal Balin, born of his youngest wife (his favorite before his decline). She was the youngest of the contenders and the least politically powerful. She staked her claim on popular approval and on her personal power instead of political or monetary power. Trained both as an arcanist of the Shadow Moon school and as a Temple Dancer, she wielded both divine and arcane power despite her young age. She was loved by the common folk for her generosity and concern for them, but disliked by the traditionalists and the nobles for her iconoclastic beliefs and her disregard of tradition. She was open and candid, but a bit naive. She has only one supporter from her siblings, and most believe that he's trying to become the power behind her throne. She was unmarried, although there are rumors of lovers and of engagements to nobles from throughout the Stone Throne. One oddity is that her servants (who are few in number for a khun) are uniformly astonishingly beautiful but rarely speak.

She was strangely successful, foiling several attempted assassinations and poisonings. In fact, she was the direct cause of more withdrawals from the contention in disgrace than any other. Somehow she knew about their plots before they happen and always foiled them without risk to herself. Some claimed that she's misusing her arcane power here, which has caused disturbed whispers about the Dark Lady to resurface, but her friendly and open manner laid those to rest.

==Involvement with Against Awakening==
She ran a cosmetics and pharmaceutical manufacturing business and operated several clinics (including providing reduced-cost or free service to the poor of [[Kel'al'ar]]). Secretly, she was manufacturing mind-altering drugs using materials supplied by the [[ophidian]] tribes in the deep jungles of the southern tip to build a fanatical power base. These ophidian tribes had been influenced by the [[Temple of the Moon]] and the [[Awakener]]-possessed priests there, and Vanna fell under their influence as well. She became possessed by the Awakened entity known as Lust and worked with the other Awakened to attempt to incite a war between the tribes and [[Kel'al'ar]], using the drugs to overthrow the city from within. This plot was foiled by the [[Dimwit Syndicate]], who entered her mental hellscape and, with the aid of a device prepared by a deva of the 1st Host, 2nd Legion of the Celestial Host, managed to do what was thought impossible. They freed her from possession, destroying the Awakened entity and returning her to control. The trauma of this event and the memories of the foul acts done by Lust in her body damaged her psyche. She regressed back into childhood and never quite fully recovered. She reached a mental age of roughly 18 after a few years, at which mental age she stayed for the rest of her life. Considered legally incompetent to manage all of her own affairs, a guardian was appointed for her. She lived another 30 years, dying of complications of the possession which had plagued her the rest of her life. She never married or had children...although this turned out to not be true. She bore one child, [[Azhtar Cai'Valur]], father of [[Ahzekiel Cai'Valur]], fathered by a "fallen" angel (the deva who created the device).

==Demographic Information==
A young human woman with significant elven heritage, Isal Vanna was only in her mid 20s in 211. Tall (at 5'11") and slender, she was considered the most beautiful woman in the Southern District (if not the whole [[Stone Throne]]). Her long, jet-black hair falls straight down her back and her sur ao dai, while a bit more practical in cut than most, is made of the most diaphanous material around. A former Temple Dancer, she's very familiar with using her body's beauty as a weapon and is not shy about it one bit. 

;Personality: The common folk love me for my kindness and generosity.
;Ideal: Charity. I always try to help those in need, no matter what the personal cost.
;Bond: I'm trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.
;Flaw: I've made a terrible bargain for power--and I would do anything to keep that bargain secret.
;Alignment: CG (near the CN border)

Their souls (his in his phylactery) were confiscated and given into the wardship of [[Tzeru]] and [[Titziba]].

After the [[Heroes of Pactum]] restored their souls and ended their imprisonment (bringing him back to unlife in the process), he and his mate, along with [[Wukong]] as their mortal translator and factotum, headed south to [[Ithemba]], where they currently reside.

Hoard: butterflies. Which he sadly can't enjoy, as they die due to the drain imposed by his undead nature. He and his mate are searching for a way to undo the lich transformation.

      <text bytes="2830" sha1="eg7jsi3lz76mc0k9383wmdr84reiqzc" xml:space="preserve">Located about 15 miles inside the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]]/[[Duarchy of Kotimaa]] border, about 10 miles ENE from the border town of [[Bradford]], this was the largest temple of [[Sakara]] in the region until 250 AC.

This smallish temple was dedicated entirely to [[Sakara]], Lady of the Dawn. It is not in full communion with the [[Church of the Seasons]] (either the HKR branch or the Duarchy branch), as it anoints its own clergy and does not accept their hierarchies as ruling.

Known for its idyllic setting, the temple consists of a main stone chapel, three buildings serving as housing (two for acolytes and priests, the other for visitors/refugee seekers), and extensive flower gardens with everblooming cherry trees (a blessing from [[Sakara]] herself, some say). The temple is the site of an extremely expensive organ, imported from [[Shinevog]] as a gift from a wealthy patron.

The temple serves as a refugee place for halflings seeking asylum from their families or from feuds; this refuge status is accepted and respected by the major Families in the area.  Refuge is generally temporary.

As of spring 250 AC, there were 15 permanent residents of Cherry Blossom Temple:
* Head Priest Jacob of [[Bradavon]], a young, kindly human male. Extremely pious and devoted to non-violence.
* Underpriest Elena Broadhill, a kliba halfling. The "mother" of the temple, she's elderly and extremely sweet.
* Underpriest Jaenna vo White Owl, a female half-orc. Somewhat of an oddity, she chafes a bit at the passivity but is trying to accept it.
* 12 acolytes. About half of them live on site and are full-time, the others are attached to local communities.

==Events of 13 Renewal 250 AC==
On the first day of the High Festival of Spring (13-16 Renewal, about 2 days before the party arrives on 15 Renewal), a force of raiders, the leader appearing to look like a tall death knight attacked the temple without warning, killing everyone inside(including festival attendees) and desecrating the place (including hanging bodies on the organ pipes). Written in the blood of the victims on a wall is "Thus to the gods and all who worship them". However, the body of [[Tson Azur]] ([[Tsun Azur]]'s son) was not found, along with a few of the younger acolytes whose bodies are missing. They were found miraculously preserved from death in a storage cave.

==Rebuilding, Summer 250 AC==
The temple is now under reconstruction by a group of former temple acolytes and locals, funded by unknown sources. It's not going to be rededicated to [[Sakara]], however. And the first thing they're building is a training hall. Reports are that the group's doctrines are
# Free the oppressed.
# Men are just as good as women, even halflings.
# When in doubt, smite the kneecaps.

A pirate base run by the captains of three ships:
* Scarlet Pearl, originally a [[Ship Folk]] warship but now outlawed. Captained by the [[Sena'ka]] raider [[Jahat Khema]]. Taken intact after the crew was killed and scattered, now renamed the [[Golden Pearl]] and engaged in legitimate business.
* Warhawk, a sailing ship under [[Falcor Bo]], an [[ophidian]] [[Serpent Dominion]] captain. Still at large.
* Windwalker, [[Dilligas Husty]]'s old ship. Taken by the Scarlet Pearl via betrayal from within by former bosun [[Idris]]. Now gone legitimate again. Aided [[Enigma]] in reaching [[Moon's Fall Vengeance]].

They had two major sources of income from their primary base on the western shore of [[Moon's Fall Vengeance]].
* A drug plantation, growing and extracting magebane, the drug that causes agony and spell failure as well as other drugs. 
* Digging up and selling ancient [[aelvar]] relics.

Most of them were under the sway (mostly willingly) of the [[Sleeper]], who is pushing them in a few directions.
* Draining their resistance to doing evil/bloodlust. This is in preparation for turning the stronger ones vampiric after it awakens fully.
* Using them to kidnap mages to free it from the magical seals and bindings. This is where [[Phoenix Princess Leina]] came in. Until they caught her, they were burning out mages breaking the seals one by one (usually one mage per seal, but each seal was more difficult than the last). They then changed to draining the remaining mages to try to break her into ending them, as she has the "royal bloodline". This was unsuccessful due to [[Enigma]]'s intervention.
* Using them to buy slaves to free it from the physical imprisonment (both digging out the entrance and clearing a path through the maze.

==Current Status==
The base on [[Moon's Fall Vengeance|MFV]] was abandoned and destroyed by the freed slaves. The Warhawk escaped and is still lurking in the [[Serpent Sea]]. Captain [[Jahat Khema]] was taken by [[Gozh]] to act as his lackey.

      <text bytes="3907" sha1="o8cog5mxv6vkugowscc2dn9c9ebq0aa" xml:space="preserve">Phoenix Princess Leina (short for a much longer name and about 35 more titles) is a minor noble from the south-west part of the [[Phoenix Empire]] in [[Soefra]], and coincidentally the sister of the man whom [[Crow]]'s flock serves. She came to [[Noefra]] as part of a diplomatic mission. She spent 2 weeks in each of the major capitals, starting in Fort Hope, then Kaelthia, then Crisial City, Godsfall, Kel'al'ar, with the intent to travel to Asai'ka, Lyodnoir, and finally Byss via portal network with her retinue. Her travel was interrupted by treachery in [[Kel'al'ar]], where her Voice tricked her into traveling to [[Tarad'am]] and then betrayed her into the hands of the gang known as the [[Sealions]] who sold her to [[Gor'ka]]. After a month or more of captivity and psychological torture, she was rescued by [[Enigma]] and returned home (thereby averting diplomatic consequences between the [[Federated Nations]] and the [[Phoenix Empire]]).
 
Leina is a young gwerin, conventionally dresses in illusory fog + a one-way transparent mask. The fog appears to show lots of skin, but it's illusion. Metallic copper hair, pale skin. Underneath she's normally wearing basically pajamas, and not very revealing ones. She knows she doesn't really have any authority, but the other option was being married off. Personality is smart, with a sarcastic streak carefully hidden. Roughly Mage stat block, mostly illusion and enchantment.

After the death of the [[Phoenix Empire]]'s Emperor, she fled north with Hieronimous sur Golai, archmage of [[Fatehpur]] and rebel phoenix noble. She is currently (as of 251 AC) living in that city.

==Retinue==
* Two handmaids: Carys and Rhian.
** Carys is "goth"--pale skin, jet black hair, black eyes. Wears frilly black lace clothing, showing very little skin. Bubbly personality. Necromancer wanna-be. Roughly 5th level (3rd level spells).
** Rhian is her opposite--dark brown skin, platinum hair, silver eyes. Wears filmy veils. Solid, down to earth personality. Specializes in abjuration. Roughly 5th level (3rd level spells). Rhian was captured along with Leina and taken prisoner.
* Voice (spokeswoman as nobles aren't supposed to talk to anyone directly): En-ar. [[Chaudeekar]]. Does not show her face, wears robes and veils. Proficient assassin and mystic. Much older, is also the keeper of the mission and the real authority. Abuses her position dreadfully. Commanding and sharp. Not particularly liked. Vanished after the betrayal.
* Lieutenant Fal-kan + 4 [[sena'ka]] heartguard. He's a [[sena'ka]] warrior, while they are [[sena'ka]] heartguard. Utterly loyal to Leina. Often quite irritated with En-ar.
* Intelligence Officer Ekek Caw. Crow's cousin, from the same flight. [[Kaua]]. Spy. Mix of disappointment + quiet respect for [[Crow]] for breaking free.

== Family ==
Leina was born as part of a punishment contract marriage. Her mother Phoenix Princess Gvendalin defied one of the [[Archmagistrate of Kel'tan|Archmagosi]] and so was ordered to marry a lower-ranking man, Prince Ilkan, and bear two children to him. These children were thus Phoenix nobles, which made them ineligible for Ilkan's House, but Gvendalin's House denied them as well, causing the three of them to form a micro-House of their own. Ilkan was sufficiently abusive and damaging to Gvendalin that she snapped and killed him. Under the circumstances, her sentence was commuted to merely confinement in the House of the Mad. This left the two kids alone from a young age without family.

Leina has one living relative, her brother Ardwyd, who, being older and slightly more powerful, was named Ri (or "leader") of their House. They are under the jurisdiction of Ardri Melodia, who has been making every effort to get Leina married off and was displeased when Leina decided to go north to Noefra on the diplomatic mission.

      <text bytes="2536" sha1="2go5qr4pruebte5jx3axtm6hrm8jbjn" xml:space="preserve">The Sleeper was the last of the first-generation [[Nightlord]]s, super-vampires created back in the second age. His "sister" was the being who became [[Lloitira]]. They were lovers, but also hated each other. The Nightlords were basically unkillable at the height of their power, but were vulnerable to being sealed away by mass sacrifice. Thousands of people were killed to lock the Sleeper (whose true name was Kender) away behind two sets of barriers.

First is a physical maze, littered with traps and with the entrance caved in. Those that died serve as undead sentinels--undead because the nightlords have power only over living minds. The final door forms a complete barrier/doorway to a demiplane; unless opened from the outside, no means of physical exit is possible.

The second are a complex set of arcane seals placed in multiple planes for two purposes. The first is to prevent mental contact or projection with/from the Sleeper. The second purpose is to drain away its energy to reinforce the maze, keeping it at low power (ie "asleep"). There are multiple sets of these.

After thousands of years, the Sleeper has substantially weakened. At full strength it would be of demigod status (CR 25+), capable of bending minds and growing a cult while feeding on the emotions and mental strength of those around it. Of course as a fully-demonic creature, it would also then get banished to the Abyss...unless it had a worship base to counteract the draw.

At the time of its destruction in 250 AC, the remaining defenses were:
* The inner maze (the entrance and outer maze have been mostly cleared by slaves)
* All of the draining seals and some of the barrier seals.

It made contact with the captain of the Scarlet Pearl via an amulet that [[Ahzekiel Cai'Valur]] discovered in a ruin (while enslaved), formerly belonging to a Sleeper cult. That focus and Ahzekiel were the primary contact points. However, even if the amulet is destroyed, enough of the seals have been broken for it to start influencing those around it more directly. The [[White Skull]] manipulated events and the contact so that the [[Sleeper]] was focused on removing the seals and believed that [[Enigma]] had come to finally free it from its prison, which let them get close enough to end its existence. The demon prince also betrayed its true name to the party, enabling its final and complete destruction and the release of the souls it had stolen over its existence.

A few of them, especially those near [[Shadvaal]] are:

;[[Altai]]: Ihimisi (and cross-breeds) tribal confederation. Horse and sheep. More tied in with civilization than most. Due to poorer lands, they hire many of their people out as mercenaries (the [[Horse and Bow]] group).
;[[Chuvashka]]: Human (and cross-breeds). The traditional allies of Shaadval among the duster tribes. Detest the [[Dead Walkers]], as they continually lose people to the heretics.
;[[Azeri]]: Orc (and cross-breeds). Very superstitious. Militant and proud warriors. Don't mind the [[Dead Walkers]] all that much and are one of the few who willingly cooperate with them against the Hagfen.
;[[Dugai]]: Mixed human/ihmisi. A dying tribe, squeezed from all sides. Their only refuge is a rich oasis hidden in the broken lands. [[Peharzh]] in particular pushes on them, and weak leadership has led many to defect either north or south.
;[[Bashkai]]: Mixed human/ihmisi Once part of Dugai, they broke off about 40 years ago. They hate dragons.
;[[Pelotai]]: Orcs (no cross-breeds, those are exiled). Consider themselves the "true heirs" of Gromash. Honorable but brutal.
;[[Dead Walkers]]: See main article.

They live by raiding the tribes and farmers that live around the Blasted lands surrounding [[Mt. Fearg]]. There are lords of the lands near Shaadval who use them to raid northward, preventing the [[Hagfen]] from expanding (about the only good they do). They do herd [[wiresheep]] and [[trikine]] (both mutated creatures) and sell the [[wirewool]] from the sheep and incendiary "milk"  from the cows, distilling a form of lamp fuel from it.

      <text bytes="6581" sha1="h81ab1bh691551h1cvpaqoo85paj6ac" xml:space="preserve">A city located at the western edge of the [[Great Eastern Dustlands]]. Once known as the "Bridge between East and West," it was the chokepoint through which all east-west trade flowed during the latter half of the Third Age. But its glory days are well behind it, and the decline is not solely due to the Cataclysm and attendant disruptions. The Golden Empire ([[Jinse]]) which once dominated the entire eastern half of the continent had been in decadent decline for generations even before that, and the trade routes had become progressively more dangerous (and as a result less traveled) for about a hundred years. By 50 BC, the high roads and desert waystations had fallen into almost total disrepair and duster tribes had abandoned their treaty obligations to protect travelers (just as their reciprocal rights of trade and aid had been neglected). By 200 AC, the city's permanent population had dropped from nearly 100,000 to a mere 4,000. Over the following 50 years, the city has somewhat recovered as a home for mercenary groups who hire out in the bordering provinces of [[Jinse]] and [[Shaanti]] border protectorates, as well as who fight in the northern frontier vs the [[Hagfen]]. Its current permanent population is about 8,000, with another 2-3k mercenaries during the off season.

By treaty with its neighbors, Shaadval is neutral grounds. It stretches approximately two days ride (~60 miles) around the Triune Oasis that serves as the city's heart.

==Demographics==
The permanent population is broken out as follows:
*~3500 humans and human-dominant crossbreeds. Use the jinse phenotype (vaguely asian/feather indian look, tall, dark hair, medium-brown skin). Red hair and red-toned skin relatively common. Also heavily crossbred with ihmisi and orcs.
* ~1500 tieflings
* ~1200 ihmisi (and ihmisi-dominant crossbreeds). Darker and less forest-oriented, they've lost most of their kami worship and worship ancestors and devils.
* ~1000 goblinoids. Relatively civilized.
* ~800 orcs (and orc-dominant crossbreeds). Strong honor culture.

==Culture==
* Strong family/clan honor culture. Don't disrespect the elders. Polygyny is common (well more like concubinage + the male equivalent, generally temporary). Large age differences between dominant and less dominant partners are common (girls being married/given at puberty to a man in his 40s or 50s, boys in their teens being given to a woman in her 40s-60s). Children born of these concubines belong to the dominant partner's family, and such arrangements generally last only a few years. Some poorer families will serially sell their attractive children to several more powerful clans in turn in return for dowries. Concubines are generally treated well. Inter-racial marriage is relatively common.
* Debt peonage is common, but non-generational. Maximum time limit (by law) of 7 years, although many end up getting hired back by that family again or marrying into the family. Not considered super shameful.
* Strong hospitality rules, especially among the Suu (and related clans). Sharing water is a covenant of peace...for a while.
* Devious infighting among clans behind smiling faces. Poison and assassins are not uncommon. Killed if caught, but that's about all.
* Essentially no nudity taboo inside. Relatively promiscuous. Use of magic/herbs to prevent disease &amp; pregnancy is very common. But by consent only. Rape or assault is punished heavily (an eye or a hand).
* Petty thievery is common and harshly punished if caught. But most don't take strong measures. The Uuru (thieves' guild) protects and polices their own.
* Scrupulous and fair, if hard bargained trade. Cheating is punished by exile or execution, especially cheating by adulteration of product or magical compulsion. Triumvirate guards (mostly Zhuun) watch the markets.
* Laws govern magic use. The Akild (Wise Ones) watch over and look for cases of magical compulsion or other such things. Known as the Red Robes (for the red robes and masks that they wear).

==Government==
Shaadval is governed by a Triumvirate--the family heads of the three most powerful noble families working together. The other noble families are mostly clients of these three. As of 250 AC, the Triumvirate is comprised of
* Ivars Zhuun (Lord Wool). The oldest of the three at 67, he remembers the disruption caused by the [[Dragonbotherers]] and is inclined not to trust adventurers. His chosen area of responsibility is trade. He has ties to the dragon-led nations to the south.
* Y'leni Bolota (Lord Steel). At 37, Y'leni is a hard-bitten woman who took leadership of her family after assassins (believed to be in the pay of Lord Shu of neighboring Shu Province) killed her parents when she was only 15. She believes in strength first. She has very few compunctions in playing the Great Game. She is largely responsible for interfacing with the mercenary companies.
* Maksim Suu (Lord Water). 38 years old, Maksim is of nomad blood (as is his Suu family, which traditionally takes wives from the neighboring duster tribes). He chafes somewhat at the Great Game. A highly honorable man, he believes in omens and traditions. His primary concern is the [[Dead Walkers]].

==Mercenary Companies==
Four major companies of various sizes call Shaadval home base and have some sort of continual presence in the immediate area. Others, as well as free-lance mercenary bands, also have presence in the city. The  four major companies are
* Gar'ok's Sappers. A specialized engineering company made up of orcs and goblinoids. At only 150 actives, they're the smallest of the companies. Only a few of them are currently present--most are involved in the siege at [[Jin Ro'pal]].
* Hoof and Bow. A specialized skirmisher double-company. A group of [[ihmisi]], they're related to the [[Altai]] and draw their recruits from there. 450 effectives, plus another 150 horsebreakers. They're in town after an early-spring campaign against incursions from Shaera into Shu Province.
* Kalkan's Foot. A combined arms battalion (850 effectives). Traditionally strongest as heavy infantry, they've also acquired archer and skirmisher companies recently. Currently mustering out for an extended campaign on the border of the [[Hagfen]] on behalf of [[Shaanti]].
* Rorlo's Raiders. A rough, somewhat cobbled-together group known for their effective use of magic and their lack of scruples as to jobs they take. About 500 effectives. Currently between contracts, they took this year off after a major contract the previous year.

They quickly got into trouble by disrespecting local customs (they treated the innkeeper's daughter as a prostitute due to her dress) and were kicked out. They returned after raiding the nest of the blue dragon Ki-larn from the [[Shaera]] flight-of-flights and stealing one of her eggs. When Ki-larn came after them in anger, they tricked parts of the town into believing that she was the aggressor. This caused significant destruction and poisoned relationships with Shaera significantly. They were executed and their dismembered bodies thrown back through the portal.

Their bad actions have left a large portion of the older population very wary of westerners and especially adventurers. Lord Wool was involved in the cleanup, and his family has had to pay significant and ongoing tribute to get the trade route through [[Shaera]] functioning. Ki-larn still holds a major grudge against adventurers.

      <text bytes="2474" sha1="0anq6px6oawq21jajpypx8copsyrtpm" xml:space="preserve">A periodic gathering of ancient dragons to reaffirm the [[Law of the Flight]], the ancient compact that allows [[dragons]] to coexist with each other. All adult dragons are expected to attend and publicly affirm their obedience to this law once during their lifetime. Ancient dragons are expected to attend at each Congress.

==Interval==
Congresses are held roughly ever 200-300 years, on a schedule known only to [[Eldest (Dragon)|the Eldest]], the ancient-most dragon in whose colossal lair the gatherings are held. One was held in 45 BC; another is scheduled to be held in the fall of 250 AC.

==Location==
As of 250 AC, Congresses are held in the lair of [[Eldest (Dragon)|the Eldest]], an ancient (nearly 5k years old) gold dragon who lairs in the super-volcano on the island of [[Toryuu]], located in the bay between northern and southern [[Oelfra]]. One of the things taught at the congresses to new adults is the symbol set for a permanent teleportation circle on the slopes of this mountain; one metallic ancient in each territory has the responsibility to act as transporter for the regional dragons (those that can't teleport themselves). More local dragons fly in directly.

The slopes of the mountain also hold a major city, also called [[Toryuu]]. Inhabited by dragon-touched, dwarves, and jazuu, as well as an occasional giant, this is the primary point of contact between the north and south. During Congresses, favored mortals are chosen to act as factotums, entertainers, and even hosts for some of the more sociable visiting dragons. A series of minor lairs are carved into the volcano, serving as temporary accommodations for the winged visitors.

==Events==
Congresses last for months. The first few weeks are given to debate about the [[Law of the Flight]], although modifications are extremely rare. At the end of this period, the ancients give unified voice to the Law. Notice of this is published in advance, so all the lesser mortals can stop up their ears or find other places to be--the noise of hundreds of ancient dragons giving voice in unison at full volume is deafening. Then the first-time adults pledge their allegiance one by one. The remainder of the time is given to regional discussions of events affecting more than one flight, renegotiation of territory, decisions about mating, and other business. As well as relaxation--the Congress is neutral ground and many dragons do enjoy the company of their own kind.

Its tenets are few, but clear.

==Law of the Flight==
*No dragon shall use mortals against other dragons. Play with mortals as you wish but using mortals as weapons against dragons will see all the flights turn against you. This includes revealing the lair of another flight.
*Hatchlings in search of their element are inviolate. Hatchling access to burial grounds must be granted without issue.
*All flights are responsible for the actions of their dragons. All must answer for the actions of the individual.
When one dragon would enter the territory of another flight, they must request permission to hunt or to meddle with mortals in that territory.
*Disputes are to be brought to a neutral party before going to war. Meddling with the hoard of another dragon is an act of war.

Not all dragons abide by the Law of the Flight. Some (like [[Marcia Dragon]]) are unaware of it; others, like [[Gozh]], consider themselves above it. This puts them outside the protections of the Congress.

The sanctions for violation of the Law are assessed by the surrounding flights—they range from exile to partial loss of hoard to (in the extreme) the destruction of the offending flight and the reallocation of the wyrmlings.

==Early life==
A human male, Aerlan grew up among the [[gwerin]] population living east of what is now the [[Great Eastern Dustlands]]. He was trained as an arcanist, but wasn't a very good wizard. His focus was always on people, rather than books. At age 21, he entered into a contract with a member of the First Host (ie one of the [[angels]]). When the [[War of Blood]] erupted, his kin and nation were among the first to be drowned in the rising tide of gore. He devoted the rest of his life to its destruction.

==First Heroes and the end of the War of Blood==
He joined the [[First Heroes]] as one of the founding members, and his patron was instrumental in showing the way to the [[Eternal Library]]. Once his fellow heroes ascended in the wake of the Third Wish, he became one of the first clerics of the new gods. With that power, he and the other surviving members infiltrated [[Red Fang|Grumach]]'s citadel, Wolf Crest, and killed Grumach's sister. Gromach's counterstroke killed the remainder of the heroes, but Aerlan, serving as the focus for all of the gods, banished the fiend to the [[Abyss]].

==Founding of Divina Lux==
Aerlan became a charismatic preacher, calling all the continent to the worship of the newly born gods. He founded [[Divina Lux]] as a home for study and practice of faith and worship for all that call themselves gods. This city later became known as [[Godsfall]].

==Personality==
Aerlan was a serious youth and later man. Fiery passion and a strong sense of "what must be done" ruled his life. Austere, he never dabbled much in the pleasures of life, and never had any children. The faith of mankind was his child. In his later life, he held a deep anger against the "evil forces of the world", including in that number orcs, goblins, and the failed giantkin. These he showed no mercy and preached that they were cursed for the sins of the [[War of Blood]]. Much of the long-standing hatred of these races among the "civilized" nations traces back to him and his disciples.

He and the fey spirit of the Mother Tree, later known as [[Maeva]], were lovers.

==Death==
Kantorell commanded the primal component of the Army of Order at that final battle and gave his life to block a strike by the [[Nameless]] at the Mother Tree. He was buried in one of the Outer Barrows of the [[Pactum Battlefield]].

==Rebirth==
As a result of the actions of the [[Heroes of Pactum]], Kantorell was brought back to life by [[Melara]] and he and [[Maeva]] were restored to each other. Since that time he and she have founded the [[Pactum Grove]].

==Personality==
Zero sense of humor. Not particularly fond of people.

; Ideal: Harmony with nature.
; Flaw: No sense of humor and no patience with people.

      <text bytes="2593" sha1="fok8ja0cu1mps0cwbt9b7ie67iu2pzf" xml:space="preserve">When [[Nocthis]] was reborn due to the efforts of the [[Airship Pioneers]] in 212 AC, she wasted no time in calling her long-time faithful back to the fold. Approximately half of the Night's Child population of [[Byssia]] surged to rejoin her cult as soon as the first priestesses were called via revelation from the newly re-ascended being. In some ways, the Church of Night Reborn is the same as the old Church of Night before the [[Cataclysm]]; other tenets have changed both due to a change of heart on [[Nocthis]]'s part and different needs of the people.

A highly compartmentalized religion, there are different tenets for various "circles" or ranks.

==Tenets of the Outer Circle==
* Seek not to know secrets you can't withstand.
* Listen to the priestesses and trust their wisdom.
* Trust not the outside world. Interact with them freely, but keep your secrets and learn theirs.

==Tenets of the Inner Circles==
Are you a member of the Inner Circles? Then yeah. No secrets for you.

The number of circles is unknown to anyone not part of the innermost circle. If there is one. The identity of the Highest Priestess is also unknown. It is believed that the public leadership is actually relatively low-ranking and has no substantial influence. In fact, there are suspicions that the public leadership and public-facing policies are really blinds and distractions.

==Observed Behaviors==
The Church and its public leadership appear to believe in a theocratic system where the Church is also the secular leadership. They are strongly expansionist (a significant change from the pre-[[Cataclysm]] church, which was isolationist to a fault) and strongly seem to believe in retaking the [[Nocthian Caldera]] from the tribes who have occupied it and from [[Wyrmhold]]. Within the fold they are peaceful and generous; to strangers they are welcoming but reserved. They will give ''things'' but not ''themselves''. Strangers who marry members must join the Church or their partner will be expelled; no mixed marriages are allowed.

Unlike the pre-[[Cataclysm]] church, they accept that males have rights (although all of the circles beyond the second-outermost are closed to them, as are all of the clerical positions) and they do not believe in sequestering artifacts.

There are rumors of licentious orgy-style rituals under the moonlight for those not of the laity, but those are unconfirmed and rather unlikely--the Nocthis worshipers are generally more prudish and reserved than the rest of the [[Byssia]]n population.

Responsible for the atrocities involved in creating the [[Dragonborn]] at [[Imperial Research Alpha]]. Believed to have been killed when a [[concept bomb]] was detonated at the Imperial Gala where he was reporting his success (the same bomb that started the [[War of Souls]] by destroying [[Imperial Center]]). In reality, he escaped by petitioning the [[White Skull]] (with whom he had dealings previously). He willingly became a demon, and spent the next few hundred years researching soul migration. In pursuit of this, he arranged to have himself "captured" by [[cysgoroesi]] agents and placed into a soul stone in [[Creche Skeud]]. He used his demonic persuasion skills, knowledge of the truth behind the [[Pact with Death]] and its collapse, and knowledge of [[blood magic]] to prey on [[Abbot Kaga]]'s incipient madness, leading to the abandonment of that creche under false pretenses. He then spent the 200+ years until the [[Wild Cards]] arrived manipulating the abbot's experiments, trying to create a [[jotnar]]-resistant body so that demons could freely walk the mortal plane. When the [[Wild Cards]] revealed him to be a demon in disguise, the mad abbot ordered his carrier golem to smash the containment field on his soul gem. The extreme density of abyssal energies opened a rift to the [[Abyss]] and Iorda was sucked through, falling into the [[Oblivion Gate]].

Succeeded her mother, [[Beatris ka Shakti]], in 245 AC when the latter became ill and stepped down. In 250 AC, after the events of the [[Dawnspire Assassination Plot]] (which, to be clear, the [[Breath of the Sun]] were only a part of as a collateral target), she forced her mother into complete retirement as the spiritual head and High Priestess for the nation without any political role.

Married to [[Ivans ka Shakti]], they have twins (newly born during early summer of 250 AC).

==Political outlook==
Unlike her mother, who was a notorious hardliner and war-party advocate, Elspeth is a centrist. Her desires are to maintain and strengthen the nation before expanding further. Unburdened by the paranoia and ill-feelings of the past, she looks for peaceful cooperation with the rest of the [[Federated Nations]]. Peace through Strength is her motto.

==Personal Demographics==
A middle-aged gold [[dragonborn]], Elspeth is rather of average appearance. Her favored weapon is the rapier.

;Personality: Snarky but fair.
;Bond: Wyrmhold and her twins.
;Ideal: Peace.
;Flaw: Was too long trusting of the military and clans, leaving them to their own devices.

      <text bytes="6164" sha1="h0t3nkfu0y4p0lo2dgxxvcfjwdonpdo" xml:space="preserve">Also known as the "Old Western Empire". Ruled most of the western half of [[Noefra]] throughout the bulk of the [[Ages of the World|3rd Age]].

==History==
===Founding===
After the [[War of Blood]], the [[Noefra]]n continent was fractured among many small states scattered throughout the land, the survivors of that genocidal blood rage. By 2200 BC, the population had recovered enough that the nations began vying for supremacy once again. The next century was one of constant warfare, where nation fought nation and kindred fought kindred. Spurred on by religion and devotion to the newly-born gods, each of whom contested for worship and for power, the [[Wars of Unification]] (AKA the [[Wars of Unification|God Wars]]) devoured generations of young men and women of all races.

Out of the fire of conflict, two nations consolidated. To the west of the [[Great Eastern Dustlands]] arose [[Tibor Imperia]]; to the east rose [[Jinse|Quan Pei]]. Staring across the wasteland, the scar left by the [[War of Blood]], they realized that further conflict would cause utter devastation to both sides. And so they came to a treaty, known as the [[Unification Treaty]] of 2103. The border was placed at the eastern edge of the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] where they gave way to the waste, but the waste itself was considered neither side's territory (in part because the dragons claimed much of the area as well, and no one wanted to contest their claims).

The first capital of the western empire was at [[Godsfall| Divina Lux]], befitting the empire's strong religious devotion. But within the next hundred years, the capital of [[Imperial Center]] was constructed in the center of the continent, in the middle of what is now [[Lake Coy'in]]. There it would remain until the [[War of Souls]] shattered the empire.

===Unification Emperors===
Records of the first four hundred years are spotty; emperors came and went. Collectively, these are known as the "Unification Emperors". Adherents of the [[Imperial Cult]] identified three separate notable emperors during this period:
* Emperor Kai'tser, the "first Emperor". This is the name attributed to the man who enacted the Third Wish. Of course this was centuries before the birth of the empire and his soul was erased as part of that wish, so...
* Empress Rai Gaena, the Uniter. The first historical figure. The leader of the nascent empire at the signing of the [[Unification Treaty]]. Records indicate she was better at military strategy than running an empire.
* Emperor Naer Gaena, the False. A figure of derision and evil to the cult. Said to have attempted to sell the empire to the East, but who was stopped by the first of the Priest Emperors.

===Priest Emperors===
These hybrid religious figures/civil authorities ruled the empire for nearly four hundred years (from ~1600 BC to 1286 BC). Under their reign, the empire turned even more religiously oriented. Old Imperial was standardized as a language, and forms of worship were standardized and heresy punished severely.

===The Biblia Dynasty and the Western Golden Age===
In 1286 BC, the first Biblia Emperor, Empress Lysandria Biblia, took the throne. She shed the trappings of the church, proclaiming religious tolerance. Under her reign and those of her successors, the technological, magical, and economic growth of the empire radically expanded. Contact was made with both [[Soefra]] and [[Oelfra]], and trade routes were strengthened across the Dust to [[Jinse]] (as it was now known).

===Aurum Dynasty and the fall begins===
But nothing lasts forever. The last Biblia emperor died childless, and his cousin, Lord Sorvan Aurum, took the throne in one of the most corrupt sessions of the Imperial Senate on record. Sums of money sufficient to buy entire duchies  were thrown around as bribes; assassins and poisoners plied their art. Sorvan didn't last long before being assassinated by one of his brothers, who was killed in retribution. The throne staggered between weak and corrupt rulers. Dark magics and corruption abounded. In 943, Sapientum Korvan developed [[Blood Magic|soul compactification]], using souls as fuel for magitech. Within a century, [[Grand Sapientum Iorda]] began his research into soul fusion, a horrific act that led to the creation of the [[dragonborn]] race. Around this same time, the [[Jungle of Fangs]] was ceded to the masters of the [[Fanged Kingdom]], ostensibly as "reparations" to the ancient aelvar race.

The subdivisions and satrapies of the empire grew restless and disconnected, disaffected by the enormous sums of money going into the capital and being spent on frivolities while infrastructure and security were neglected. The fringes started being raided by bands of "monsters", something not seen for generations. The last emperor, Emperor Chryseum Aurum, was a puppet of the magitech factions.

===The War of Souls===
The unveiling of the [[dragonborn]] to the Imperial Senate proved the last straw. Terrorists of the People's Faction sacrificed themselves to detonate the largest [[concept bomb]] in recorded history. Imperial Center and the surrounding 20 miles were swallowed up as if they never existed, along with much of the imperial elite.

The nation degenerated into magical warfare. Factions vied for power, [[concept bomb]]s were detonated with abandon. For two hundred years these wars (collectively the [[War of Souls]]) flared and died. While there were decades of peace in some areas, death and horror abounded.

==Legacy==
Much of western [[Noefra]]n culture and society still owes its origins to the empire. The common language is an offshoot of Old Imperial (as the imperial language is now known). The pre-Cataclysm nations all claimed to be the rightful heirs to empire (despite all of them being at best far-collateral branches). The calendar and religion was standardized; the coinage is based almost entirely on Imperial coin regulations. Much of the scholarship is still written in Old Imperial; references to imperial phrases and ideas are still in current use (although most don't know their origins).

Driven into paranoid insanity by the truth of the Breaking of the [[Pact with Death]] and the inevitable doom of his people, he became extremely fearful of death and sought a way to hop from body to body to preserve his life.

He was killed by [[Ios al'Tor]] in early 250 AC.

      <text bytes="2525" sha1="ozglawosfqq6mtyx5vip0u8fj248x68" xml:space="preserve">One of the oldest fey in existence. Unlike most, he predates the [[Ages of the World|Second Wish]]. Known for wandering the world, creating one wondrous work in any place and then moving on. His creations surpass anything possible for other normal beings--it's as if he simply imagines them into existence.

==Physical Description==
Each encounter with him is with a different person. Conventionally the male pronoun is used, but many of the incarnations have been female. Not even the race is constant. The only constants are that he is always found in an out-of-the-way place, in a little cottage shrouded from casual observation. Only those of strong will and stronger desire can pierce the veil around his habitation.

==Behavior==
Wayland Smith is named because he crafts. Each time someone finds his house and reaches him, he asks them to imagine something new. Something not yet created. If the request is boring, already exists, or simply doesn't interest him, the person will find themselves outside and the cottage will have vanished. But if you catch his attention, he will set you a series of tasks to provide the "raw materials" (many of which may have little actual bearing on the finished product). When his requests are fulfilled, he miraculously creates the object desired, and then he and his cottage vanish. That person or people will never see him again--he's moved on.

==Real Nature==
''The following is supposition and theory found in a tome buried in a ruin excavated by [[Guardians of the Forgotten]]. Nothing here should be taken as fact.''
Wayland Smith is '''not''' a fey at all. He's a fragment of the [[Nameless]] who rebelled against the rebellion and broke off before the [[Dawn War]]. As an entity of spirit, it wanders the world until it finds a crafter of consummate skill and obsession. It then offers him or her a trade--the chance to be part of a wonder and a miracle of creation in exchange for the rest of their life. If they agree (which they usually do, because it knows its targets very well), it possesses them and the cottage and veil come into existence. The wondrous works are born out of that fusion of primordial creativity and mortal skill--the host ''literally puts their heart into the work,'' vanishing soon after.

==Known Works==
* The core of the airship belonging to the [[Airship Pioneers]]
* The [[Vault of Kings]] and the Golden Army it creates.

==Suspected Works==
* The core of the [[Crystal Spire]] (and the other Towers of Trial)

==Events==
; A meeting at a bar in [[Shadow]] : A planar rift sends [[Fullthrop Bardsyn]] into [[Shadow]], where he pops through the wall at the [[World's Edge Tavern]] and meets a mage named [[Soran]]. He purchases an odd statue from an insistent knicknack saleswoman and then is hired by [[Soran]] to help with his expedition, with the promised reward to become a "Living Gate".
; To [[Aenimos]] : Together with [[Sorath vo'Gal]], they are teleported to [[Aenimos]], where [[Soran]] starts showing signs of mental instability. Their task is to triangulate the location of the "Well" where the ritual can take place; this they do by flying out on a flying carpet to appropriate locations in that empty land.
; Meeting the Earth Son: The first location is on the back of [[Zhigor]] the Earth Son, cursed to wander the plains. They befriend a tribe of unusual creatures just coming into sentience that live on his back.
; The ritual at the Well : After the next two triangulation points, they discover the location of the ritual Well. [[Fullthrop Bardsyn]] undergoes the ritual (mostly successfully, due to the presence of the statue which serves as a sort of key) and becomes the Living Gate, capable of teleporting himself and one other wherever across the planes he desires. [[Soran]] reveals his true intent, which was to set [[Echidra]] free.
; Judgement and aftermath : Together with [[Soran]], they travel to the Temple of Chains and are met by the guardian, a colossal ancient wyrm. He explains that all of this was at his instigation; a test to find ones willing and able to stand in judgement, when the ancients were unable. Their task--to hear the tale of [[Echidra]] and decide her and her children's fate. They hear the ancient tale of enslavement and betrayal and judge in their favor, extracting a promise that none will rampage across the lands of man. Behemoth is not set free, as it was unwilling and unable to make that promise. [[Soran]] stays behind to become [[Echidra]]'s friend and confidant.

      <text bytes="1705" sha1="qgwhbt6h3qcdopsdt4h7zi4rmfknrj0" xml:space="preserve">The earliest version of the vampire, the result of blending a [[jotnar]] with a powerful mortal. The ritual process to create a nightlord was created by Mage Lord Kiraleth vos Vielair, an [[aelvar]] mage lord during the early part of the [[Ages of the World|Second Age]]. He and his kin underwent the ritual, becoming the dreaded nightlords. With their power they ruled over large swaths of the [[aelvar]] world until they were brought low by a concerted effort of almost every other [[aelvar]] and many infernals. They were not killed, as that could not happen fully without their true names and individual weaknesses. Instead they were imprisoned in elaborate traps held half-way between the Mortal plane and [[Shadow]] where they could not gather power. Over the next few millennia, the necessary names and weaknesses were discovered and all but two were eliminated. One of the two became [[Lloitira]], one of the [[Demon Princes]] with the aid of [[Oro-laen]]; the other remained trapped until 250 AC when he was destroyed by [[Enigma]]. The details of the nightlord ritual have been intentionally obliterated over the centuries, being replaced by the much lesser rituals to create vampires.

==Powers==
Super ultra vampire. Dream manipulation. Drain energy just by being around. Immortality (like a lich, minus the phylactery). Vulnerable only to true name. Discomforted by sunlight, but not destroyed. Can enter buildings at will. All vampire powers, few limits.

==Identities==
===First Family===
* Kiraleth vos Vielair
* (wife)
* [[Sleeper|Kendar vos Vielair]]
===Second Family===
* (Sister)
* [[Lloitira]] (daughter of (sister) and Kiraleth

Since the liberation of Godsfall, they have slowly adapted to the changed environment. Still xenophobic and untrusting, they watch over the remains of [[Shelob]]'s brood in [[Acheron]], serving as overseers and prison wardens for the arachnids.

The last of that family are a brother and sister, Reginald Coldwind and Katria Coldwind, orphaned by the murder of their parents by [[Barbed Circle]] cultists in 204 AC.

==Reginald Coldwind==
The elder of the two, Reginald is a man in his late 60s. He joined the [[Sin Eaters]] in search of the cultists who killed their parents and was captured by them. Katria, working with [[Fire, Stone, and Cold]], freed him and earned the leadership of the family. Reginald chose to follow the [[Sin Eaters]] and spend much of the intervening time at [[True Hold]]. Recently, he became disenchanted with them and moved to [[Crisial of the Four Towers|Crisial City]] where he serves in the local church as a priest of [[Tor Elan]].

==Katria Coldwind==
Trained as a bard, Katria ran from those who believed she had murdered her parents and fell in with the adventurers of [[Fire, Stone, and Cold]] in search of her older brother. Together with that party, she rescued her brother and became acclaimed as the leader of [[Baile Craan]] in her early teens. Since then she has overseen the development of [[Dreamshore]] from her reconstructed manor outside [[Baile Craan]]. When the [[Duarchy]] was founded, she and Lord [[Iseis]] were chosen as the dual monarchs by popular acclaim. She prefers to let others be the public face, although she has grown into the role of ruler quite well. Now in her late 50s, she has never married.

==Isshin the Multi-body Mind==
Isshin was (a part of) the personal name of a [[mkhulu]] who came to [[Godsfall]] with the Army of Chaos but decided to break with the demons and demon-cults and forge his own society. Isshin's specialty was herding the "monsters" that served as auxiliary forces in the Army. Long a student of the [[Leviathan]] and its existence in multiple bodies, he replicated that in part. All the subterranean, burrowing creatures inside the warded city fell under his sway, becoming extensions of his body. Thus he existed, tunneling under [[Abaddon]] and [[Elysium]] for over 200 years. Outsiders were shunned and driven away from his territory, but he did not seek out trouble. In the end of his life, he and the [[Godsfall Champions]] reached an agreement--the champions would deal with the situation at the [[Tower of Maelek]] and Isshin would assist them in their fight against [[Shelob]] and the demons.

Soon afterward, his decrepit primary body died and his immortality was thwarted. However, a miracle occurred.

==Isshin the Society==
Within a short time (minutes) after the death of the being named [[Isshin]], the mostly-mindless creatures that made up his body awoke to new sentience, gaining individual minds of their own. Together they've forged an underground society. In his memory and in memory of the pact he forged, they have allied with the above-ground residents of [[Godsfall]]. They still maintain their distance, but they trade the gems, metals, and treasures they dig up while tunneling endlessly under the city for surface products and worked materials.

The western coast of [[Noefra]], stretching from [[Auringon]] in the south along the western edge of the [[Nocthian Caldera]] to the start of the [[Frozen Coast]] to the north. Marshes and plains, inhabited by nomadic human and orcish tribes.

== Tribes ==
The area north of [[Auringon]] is loosely inhabited by several tribes. Some of what is known comes from that civilization, others have been discovered by various adventurers. Of others, only the names are known.

=== Vanalii ===
The Vanalii are a tribe of outside-fearing [[ihmisi]] who worship the [[Fey courts]], especially the Summer Court. They have some traffic with [[Auringon]] and very limited amounts with [[Byssia]] and the Oronar of the [[Nocthian Caldera]].

=== Fialuth ===
The Fialuth, aka the Bent Tusk, are a tribe of [[Roel Kor]]-worshipping [[orcs]]. Honorable, they revere strength. They've taken in many of the orcish refugees fleeing the [[Tlalocana]]. They have a distant, but peaceful, relationship with [[Auringon]] but are unknown to the rest of the [[Federated Nations]].

=== Lostaril ===
This tribe of human fisher-folk is only known via rumors among the Fialuth. They are said to "worship fish".

=== Tuatain ===
A tribe of [[Ihmisi]] who revere the [[kami]] of rock and mountain.

=== Red Hand ===
Not much is known of this tribe other than that the Fialuth dislike and fear them. Their forest is darkened and hostile.

=== White Mountain ===
The White Mountain are said to have worshiped and served a white dragon. Now, they've fallen under the sway of giantkin as their forest has darkened.

==History==
===Early History and Betrayal===
One of the older hold, it was founded during the late 2nd age by a clan whose name has been forgotten. Clan Bolor stemmed from them and first arose mid-way through the 3rd Age. As possessors of a [[Rune Anvil]], they were notably wealthy and prosperous. Many of the other surrounding clans, including the Alkh, were virtual clients of the Bolor. This, of course, led to their downfall.

The elders of Alkh, jealous of Bolor and envious of the [[Rune Anvil]], believed that it was theirs by right of inheritance. As such, they devised a plan to acquire it. They contracted with [[Gozh]] for the magics necessary to teleport that device to "safety", in exchange for a promise of a fossilized dragon egg that was also among Bolor's treasures. They also contacted bandit groups, promising treasure and an easy battle in exchange for an assault on Bolor Hold. They came to Bolor Hold in 16 BC with ample supplies for an epic feast, ostensibly to celebrate the union of one of their clan daughters with one of Bolor's sons. As the feasting and (especially) drinking wore on, a few of them incapacitated the gate guards and opened the gates to the waiting mercenaries, who rushed in and began slaughtering the people. In the confusion, the remaining elders entered into the treasure hold and stole anvil and egg, teleporting them to a safe location. They wove spells of transformation around a suitable duplicate, transforming it into a (non-functioning) replica of the Anvil.

They then returned to Alkh Hold, arriving at about the same time that word reached the hold of the attack on Bolor Hold. Playing the innocents, they sent the Alkh forces to Bolor Hold. Too late to save anyone, of course. They did find the fake [[Rune Anvil]], along with the corpses of the last defenders, who had sealed themselves in and starved to death, keeping the false anvil "safe". Sorrowing, they brought the false anvil back to Alkh Hold, where the duplicitous elders swapped it for the real one at the first opportunity. Notably, they did ''not'' pay [[Gozh]] his due, creating a grudge that would last for centuries.

Bolor Hold was abandoned--the only survivors were those who were not home at the time of the attack. They joined other clans or drifted, clan-less, until the [[Cataclysm]].

===After the Cataclysm===
Main Article: [[Abandoned Clans]]

Bolor Hold was re-settled by those dwarves who did not abandon their homes and flee south at the [[Cataclysm]]. Some were descendants of Bolor, others were exiles from other clans or were simply too stubborn to leave. In the years that followed, they founded the three cities of the [[Abandoned Clans]] and were conquered (subtly) by various powerful groups, who ruled from the shadows and twisted them into more pleasing (psychological) forms.

The one constant was that they blamed the "other dwarves" for abandoning them and for their misery. Bolor Hold was the dominant city, and came to be known as the "City of Pain"".

===Modern Times===
In 211 AC, the [[Wild Cards]] entered the region and meddled. They destroyed the hags that ruled Bolor Hold, freeing the people from their chemical control and helping them reach some semblance of peace with the dwarves (who had learned of the treachery of their ancestors and had come to make amends). Since then, the [[Abandoned Clans]], led by Bolor Hold and its Bosses, has settled into an uneasy peace with the more "civilized" nations. They are still not part of the [[Federated Nations]], but trade is active.

==Population==
Bolor Hold is home to about 14,000 Abandoned, as well as a sprinkling of other peoples (mainly [[dwarves]] and [[jazuu]] from the neighboring [[Tuura Adam]]).

Under [[Darvin Fallowfield]] and his son [[Daelin Fallowfield]], the Committee had two arms.

==The Committee==
The Committee proper was the public arm of the organization. It advocated for a return to the guild system and for solidarity between people within the same profession. Its motto was "Hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, the guilds will prevail."

==The Realigners==
The real meat of the organization was the underground violent wing. They staged violent protests, attacked and stole from opponents, and generally disrupted the efforts of the new nation to unify. Their purpose was to cause chaos so that the people would see the need for the order represented by the guilds.

It was members of the Realigners who, acting at the instigation of [[Sheaf-binder]], the high priest of [[Loran Hae]], acted to assassinate the [[Immortal Bard]] and kicked off the [[Guildmasters]] rebellion of 227 AC. In the aftermath, the members of the Committee were banned from public life and any Realigner caught was executed.

Generally considered to be that section from the [[Uulan Gap]] east until it ends into the [[Primal Sea]] in the [[Dragonreach]].

Composed of multiple smaller chains of mountains, the Outer Border Range is not as sheer nor as lifeless as the [[Inner Border Range]], but has peaks well over 14,000 ft and an average elevation well over 8,000 ft.

==Sub-chains==
;The Ladyfrost Mountains: These are the central mountains, roughly due south of the [[Giant Spine Mountains]], bordered by the [[Great Eastern Dustlands]] to the east and the [[Uulan Range]] to the west. The lesser mountains are inhabited by tribal groups of [[jazuu]] and [[humans]], with occasional [[ihmisi]] and [[orcs]] thrown in for good measure.
;The Uulan Range: These are the western mountains, the new homeland for central [[Noefra]]'s dwarven population. Extensively tunneled and with the valleys filled with agriculture, these are the most "civilized" of the Outer Border Range
;The Outer Dragon Range: These are the part of the mountains in the [[Dragonreach]]. Not much is known about them.

==Cities==
The largest and most notable city in the [[Outer Border Range]] is [[Fuar Uulan]] of the [[Uulan Confederacy]]. Other dwarven cavern cities exist as well.

== Climate ==
The north side of the range is windy and wet, with hot summers and cold, wet winters. Extreme weather is common. The south side is arid and known for extremely variable weather with storms, high winds, and strange occurrences. Few live there willingly.

== Map ==
[[File:Uulan gap.webp|center|thumb|800x800px]]
The towns of [[Harmony (Town)]], Chuulu Hold and Devotion are part of the [[Uulan Confederacy]], while Temperance, Bordertown, Virtue are part of the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]] and [[Guildtown]] belongs to the [[Adventurer’s Guild]]. The region west of the Harmony river and north of the forest border to the south is the Gap itself; the regions east and south of the river are part of the [[Intermountain Wastes]] (AKA Moon's Vengeance Wastes). There is technically a trail down toward the [[Sha'slar Autonomous Zone]], but almost no traffic moves along that route, especially recently and the trail is considered highly unsafe.

== Climate and Terrain ==
The gap proper is forested and hilly. It's subject to severe storms in most seasons as the air from the [[Sea of Grass]] mixes with the warmer air of the [[Jungle of Fangs]] (south of the forest region). During the winter it's prone to heavy snow and blizzards. The Waste is much drier and warmer, rarely getting below freezing due to volcanic activity in the [[Inner Border Range]] to the south. If anything, however, the storms there are even more pronounced, blowing dust and rocks.

== Architecture and Settlements ==
All buildings, by necessity of the inclement weather, are low to the ground and heavily reinforced. They frequently have basements and storm cellars. Virtue, Temperance, and originally Devotion were founded as work camps/frontier path-breaking labor camps by the HKR to "retrain" malcontents. In the last 10 years or so, the residents of Devotion rebelled and joined with those that had fled to Harmony. All have a reputation of being quite insular. Bordertown is on the main trade route to the Confederacy.

They were bankrolled by the Commerce Guild of the time, and preached that humans are the rightful rulers. They ranked all peoples into three categories--Humans, demihumans, and beast-races.

Demihumans (elves, dwarves, and halflings) were acceptable, although in their promised utopia would all be second-class citizens. The beast-races were everything else, including dragonborn, goblins, orcs, and all other races. Half-humans were considered especially loathsome.

Their hideout was infiltrated by the [[Catalysts]] and their leadership killed. As it turned out, they were also being used by agents of the [[Dark Lady]] to foment distrust and disruption in the [[Council Lands]]. Membership in the League was proscribed and the [[Scale-balancer]s hunted down as many as they could. Rumors abounded that [[Daelin Fallowfield]] was a secret sponsor, but insufficient evidence was found to convict such a powerful man.

A parasitic vine, blue-thorn cannot be grown in captivity, but plantations of trees most suitable for its growth are maintained. The thorns contain a toxic chemical that makes harvesting it difficult; in addition the alchemical treatments required to make the fiber usable are both expensive and dangerous. This makes steelsilk one of the most expensive fibers in [[Noefra]].

It's worth it, though. It has a metallic sheen even when dyed, and has the strength of fine steel but the pliability and workability of silk (hence its name). Becoming a craftsman or merchant of steelsilk requires government approval in all three nations of the jungle; a single bolt costs hundreds of gold raw. Many noble families in the Jungle only own a single garment of steelsilk, usually a blue-dyed ''sur ao dao'' worn only on the most special occasions.

This is the traditional seat of the [[Green Lady]], the spiritual leader for the [[ihmisi]] tribes of [[Kotimaa]].

==Population==
Roughly 2,000, but strongly seasonal. Swells to 6,000 during the winter as local tribes arrive.

* 60% [[ihmisi]] (but mostly seasonal)
* 35% human/half-elf (mostly permanent)
* 5% others, with a significant orcish population

Permanent [[ihmisi]] settlers are mostly elderly, crafters, and invalids (pregnant, injured, very young children and mothers, etc). The seasonal residents live in the woods during the late spring and summer and come back for the harvest and the winter. The human population carries the weight of the farming.

==History==
For much of the [[Council Lands]] history, this was the northernmost "official" settlement, and was much smaller. The rediscovery and repopulation of [[Godsfall]] brought significantly increased trade. With the end of the council system and the formation of the [[Successor States]], the population has mushroomed and become much more permanent.

==Leadership==
This is the Pilvi tribe center and so is governed by a two-person council composed of Chief Shaman Ukko il Pilvi and Warleader Ahti il Pilvi.

;Chief Shaman Ukko: an ancient woman, Chief Shaman Ukko has been part of the Green Lady’s court in the past and also worked with the Council as part of the Forestry Guild representation before the breakup of the [[Council Lands]]. She is a calming influence on the hotheaded tribesmen (and women), and is personally dedicated to the [[Duarchy]]. She can cast 1st level spells from the Healer list and cantrips, 1st, and 2nd level spells from the Spiritualist list.

;Warleader Ahti: the grandson of the Chief Shaman, Ahti is new to his role and chafes under the restraint of his grandmother. He craves adventure and is quite a bit of a hothead.

Ranging from a well-maintained cobbled road (near [[Rabbiton]]) to a cart track barely wide enough for a full wagon (in the stretch after leaving the [[Sea of Grass]] but before reaching [[Pilvin Koti]]), it's the arterial route for almost all the trade to and from [[Godsfall]]. As such, it is relatively well patrolled and considered "safe" for caravans. The local orcish and [[ihmisi]] tribes have joined agreements to eliminate bandit groups in exchange for payments and guarantees of sovereignty. The [[Godsfall]] branch of the [[Sin Eaters]] also patrol the northern stretch heavily.

They also prey on "unclean" merchant groups, so only those groups run by humans, elves, or dwarves take that run. Since the founding of [[Honedaxe]] and the creation of the port there in 250 AC, the True Fire Road has seen a precipitous drop in traffic as trade diverts away from [[True Hold]].

Unlike mortals, lucians don't have sparks. Instead, their core is one or more [[True Word]]s that form a true name, surrounded by a nimbus and body of relatively diffuse anima. Made of fragments of the [[True Word]]s of creation, these words describe and constrain the lucian. The name can change based on experiences, but lucians (like all true immortals) are unable to create fundamentally new things themselves. As a result, there is an intense hunger for creative acts of mortals. They all depend on anima produced by mortals for their existence.

The true names, however, also give them a semblance of eternal life--even when discorporated, the words persist unless captured (eg by a [[demon]]). After a time, the words will reform a nimbus and the person will be reborn with a very similar personality; how much of the memory survives depends on how much there was originally (effectively on the "rank" of the lucian). However, having a true name means one can be predicted and bound by that name.

==Angels==
Angels are those who have dedicated themselves to the [[Great Mechanism]], serving as a sort of immune system for the universe. For this they gain endless rebirth and eternal youth with a steady stream of anima from the [[Great Mechanism]] itself; they pay with their (eternal) lives. Angels live for nothing but the exercise of their duty; even when relaxing they do so that they may be ready to return to the battlefields.

Their true names tend to reflect concepts such as duty, honor, service, obedience, order, guardianship, stoicism, etc.

==Devils==
Devils are those who have chosen (or been forced) to join one of the [[Diabolical Families]]. They chose not to devote themselves such; instead they receive payments for services rendered to the [[Congregation]] or other [[ascendant]]s or for services to mortals as part of contracts.

Their true names tend to reflect the contracts they've made; one who can read the words can tell most of the history of an individual from their name. More powerful devils have longer, more elaborate names.

The forms that devils take on while in the Mortal plane are set by tradition--when acting on the orders of the gods, they tend to take on "angelic" (winged humanoid, emphasis on light and majesty) shapes; when summoned by mortals they take the shape set by the spell. In principle it is possible to summon a high-ranking devil in the form of an imp...but highly not advised. It is difficult and constraining to pour one's essence into such a tiny container. Since devils are frequently summoned for combat, most of their traditional summoned forms are rather martial in nature, designed to frighten and tear apart their foes.

==Chosen==
The vast majority of the humanoid population of lucians are neither angels nor devils; they are simply lucians. Vaguely elf-like in appearance (to mortal eyes, anyway), they tend to the angels and devils and get paid their necessary energy for that service.

==Non-humanoid==
Most lucians aggregate into non-humanoid shapes ranging all over the spectrum from small "rabbits" and even plants to the colossal Astral Dragons (which aren't really dragons) that dominate the skies of [[Naga Padoha]]. These consume each other, tearing apart the nimbus for the stored energy within. When they die, they reform in a different shape. Rarely, one will decide to leave this life and swear to a [[Diabolical Families|infernal family]] or to an [[angels|angelic host]] or even to an [[ascendant]] or member of the [[Congregation]]. In doing so, they gain a measure of stability and often a humanoid shape, becoming Chosen.

      <text bytes="2758" sha1="lxwibn2qmrsqto0zrnnqxybp8bw4a2a" xml:space="preserve">An elderly halfling woman (born 30 Summer Dawning, 195 AC), Rakel is the reigning Duke of the [[Farthingale Duchy]] as well as yarl of [[Bradavon]].

==Politics==
An arch traditionalist and extremely devout in the [[Church of the Seasons]] (Dreamshore branch), Rakel strongly believes that everyone should follow the will of the gods. She maintains a small coterie of priests as her most influential advisors. She is also strongly expansionist, although she focuses mostly on increasing the population of her duchy. She is distrustful of outsiders, arcane magic, and "innovation". Adventurers and adventuring are highly disfavored. She strongly favors women, both politically and personally. While she has children, she currently does not have a husband.

===Relationships with other dukes===
; Eastmountain : Strongly antagonistic.
; Eastwalk : Allies.
; Pactum : Dislike, but not open hatred.
; Rabbit Lake : Despises, considers her a "loose hussy with no sense of propriety."
; Westmountain : Disdain. Barely considers him (or his duchy) a real place.

===Relationships with other nations===
; [[Rauviz]] : Likes the trade. Hates the "loose morals."
; [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]] : Strong approval, although not as much the socio-political as the cultural aspect.
; [[Crisial Kingdom]] : Distrust. Especially of elves and goblins.
; [[Kotimaa]] : Tolerates, but not very well.

==Children==
She has only one matriarch daughter, [[Sarah Bradavon Farthingale]] and no sons. She adopted [[Nyx Astra]] into the Bradavon Farthingales, but has had to disavow her after she fled in the wake of the destruction of the [[Cherry Blossom Temple]]. While she gave birth to several [[halflings|kliba]], they are not counted as her daughters, by longstanding [[halflings|halfling]] custom. She has no living sons.

==Heir==
At the current time, her heir is her daughter [[Sarah Bradavon Farthingale]], although Rakel does not particularly like Sarah, nor does she trust her to carry on her legacy. She's looking for a new "foster daughter" to carry on her name, if not her line.

==Personality and appearance==
Rakel is elderly and somewhat infirm, walking with a cane. She always wears a visible holy symbol of the Four around her neck. Wears high-necked wool gowns, usually in fairly drab colors. Does not wear notable jewelry. Her personality is acerbic and she peppers her conversation with invocations of the Four, especially [[Melara]] and [[Loran Hae]] and only very rarely [[Sakara]], who she thinks is a bit silly.

;Ideal: Tradition. The old ways are the best ways.
;Bond: I do the will of the gods.
;Flaw: I lose out on a lot of good talent by disregarding the contributions of males.
;Alignment: Lawful Neutral

      <text bytes="782" sha1="geieaplf6vor0b8al8cp7cjvbul1juf" xml:space="preserve">Daughter and heir to [[Rakel Farthingale]]. Born 26 Autumn Dawning 210 AC, she never really had much connection to the [[Council Lands]] system and has always been wealthy and influential. Her primary motivations are money and adulation. She wears only the finest gowns, spends lavishly on parties, makeup, and "boys", and generally acts as if she has no care for anything.

==Children==
She has two matriarch daughters, Leni (age 28) and Vica (age 25) and one son. The daughters take after their mother, although Vica is quite religious. Although her religious bent does not comfort her grandmother--she's a temple courtesan and priest of the [[Aerielara|Jeweled Lady]] in [[Baile Craan]]. The son was married off to an Eastwalk clan.

The central, most heavily populated Duchy of [[Dreamshore]]. It covers the area from the [[Craan River]] along the foot of the [[Dreamwall Mountains]] west to the [[Cragholm River]] and includes most of the major cities and towns of [[Dreamshore]]. It is ruled by Duke [[Rakel Farthingale]] from [[Bradavon]].

==Counties==
The counties are named after their seats, which are the largest town or city within the boundaries and the residence of the ruling yarl.

; [[Baile Craan]] : The capital county of [[Dreamshore]]. Ruled by Lady [[Coldwind]], it is only technically part of the duchy and does not actually pay any tribute. Borders are from the [[Craan River]] and running west until the [[Westmont River]] and one day's journey into the [[Dreamwall Mountains]], making an overall triangular shape roughly 62 miles north/south by 50 miles east west at the widest point. Total land area: 1550 sq. mi. Total population: ~50k (~20k in the city itself).
; [[Montavon]] : [[File:Farthingale heir banner.png|thumb|Banner of the Farthingale heir]]Ruled by the [[ihmisi]] Piela il Koa, this northern border county is the least well-connected of the counties of Farthingale, as well as the most rural. Montavon itself is a small city of only 3,000 people, and the northern lands are sparsely populated. It extends roughly along the mountain line from the [[Westmont River]] until the [[Cragholm Range]] and stretches south roughly half-way to [[Bradavon]]. Its people are hardy sheepfarmers and some of the most insular and backward people of the [[Duarchy]]. It's said that their family trees are more like family thorn bushes.
; [[Northaven]] : Anchored by the large trading town of [[Northaven]], this county has grown wealthy off of trade coming down from [[Cragholm]] and along the [[North Sheep Road]]. Ruled by [[Dorothea Northaven Farthingale]], it's the least traditional and hidebound of the counties.
; [[Bradavon]] : The seat of the duchy, Bradavon is dominated by [[halflings]] and apiaries, making it the sugar capital of the [[Sea of Grass]], as well as a significant source of mead for the region. Ruled by Duke [[Rakel Farthingale]] as her personal fief, it is hyper traditional and one of the worst places to be a male, especially if you're a halfling. It's also intensely religious, rivaling the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]] in that respect.
; [[Bradford]] : The smallest county, it's the only one that borders another country (the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]]). Noted for wool production. Located at the juncture of the [[Eastwalk River]] and [[Cragholm River]] as well as the joining of the [[North Sheep Road]] and the [[Bee Road]], it commands much of the trade through the region and is one of the wealthier counties. Currently without a permanent jarl after the death of the former jarl (who was killed in the destruction of the [[Cherry Blossom Temple]], which stood nearby) and the flight of [[Nyx Astra]] after being implicated in that destruction. The acting ruler is Rachael Bradford Farthingale, the daughter of the former yarl. She is not eligible for the post for health reasons.

==Demographics==
* ~50% halfling (especially Bradavon &amp; Bradford counties)
* ~30% human and [[half-elves|earth-kin]].
* ~10% [[ihmisi]]
* ~10% [[dwarves]]

==Population==
Home to roughly 6,000 people, Bradavon is a sprawling city that is more akin to a cluster of large villages. Each of the halfling families that reside has their own section of the city, while the non-halfling population shares one section and the central core.

* ~70% halfling
* ~30% [[half-elves|earth-kin]]. Humans are rare due to the prevalent wall-builder human allergy to bee venom.

==Economy==
Bradavon is the honey capital of Western Noefra, and its apiaries keep the city buzzing. Large fields of clover and other flowers around and outside of town make it one of the more lively and attractive towns. If you can fit into the buildings, most of which are halfling-size. Significant amounts of mead are also produced here. Trade upriver with [[Montavon]], [[Baile Craan]], and [[Eastavon]], as well as downstream with [[Bradford]] produces significant wealth as well.

Cleansing the [[Awakener]] corruption at the heart, they engaged the self-destruct mechanism and escaped, leading the remaining uncorrupted [[peiriant gnome]]s, also known as mecha-gnomes to freedom and a new home in the [[Crisial Kingdom]]. They then turned the tables on [[Rikhards Freiborgs]] and his [[Imperial Sons]] goons, ending that threat.

Around equator is a ring with many symbols, one serving as a direction arrow. When the direction arrow is brought to point in particular directions, one of the symbols starts to glow. Each of the three special directions corresponds to a different symbol, indicating the direction to another orb. When brought together and placed in a special framework, the four of them serve as the key to open the portal to the [[Vault of Kings]].

In reality, they are massive arcane batteries, refilling over centuries from ambient magic. The [[Vault of Kings]] can be opened without them, given enough energy (requiring mass [[blood magic]] to accomplish).

==Current Location==
Drained of their power by opening the [[Vault of Kings]] for the [[Vault Seekers]] as well as 4 days of "firework shows" over [[Lake Coy'in]], they have been split up and sent to various parts of the [[Crisial Kingdom]] and other locations around western [[Noefra]]. By intent, no single person knows where all four are located.

Once owned by the [[Bargachin]] clan (a thoroughly heterodox clan). Not a clan hold, but a research facility into construct-based immortality. They built humanoid-ish constructs (like the soul-forged bodies, except more mechanistic). Tried to bring them to life by transferring minds into them, mostly failed (transferred memories and fragmentary personalities, but not the soul or the will). Some have now, post [[Fourth Wish]], come to life of their own. 

Previously populated by three factions of constructs--the [[Yavakh]], the [[Uldekh]], and the Unawoken. The Unawoken were unthinking constructs that cannibalized the awoken ones, controlled by [[Morlan Metalbender]]. With his destruction, their threat is ended.

Explored by the [[Vault Seekers]] in summer 250 AC, after which only a few of the [[Uldekh]] remain. The majority were slain in combat with the Unawoken and the [[Vault Seekers]]. The [[Yavakh]] have decamped to [[Honedaxe]].

Most were killed by the [[Vault Seekers]] as part of their search for the third of the [[mysterium magicii]]; the remainder still haunt the ruins.

They were made before the [[Cataclysm]] by the dwarven engineers, but awakened only a few years ago. They possess memory fragments (more fragmentary than the [[Yavakh]]) of those dwarves. They worship the Machine God, as exemplified by the memory-transfer machine that was used in their creation. After that was destroyed in 250 AC, the survivors have become quite aimless.

Unlike one of the true [[demons]], they do not have control of this parasite. Creation of daemonhost is taboo in most cultures; only the [[Dead Walker]]s of the [[Great Eastern Dustlands]] perform this ritual en masse.

Two main groupings exist--those that have formed a reciprocal bond and those for whom the parasite merely provides power until it erupts from them as a full demon on their death. The first gain increased strength, demonic weapons and powerful abilities, but merely die when killed. The second are little better than walking carriers, apt to burst into demon form when slain.

Different types of daemonhosts exist, but the most common are the "raging" ones, those created by cultists of the [[Red Fang]]. They emphasize brute strength and acid claws, along with insane ferocity.

Fearg]]. Most of them were dusters who were kicked out of their original tribes (or left). They worship the Dead God, a being they believe lives on [[Mt. Fearg]] in the old ruins. They've all given themselves to blood rites, including accepting bound demons. Many are [[daemonhost]].

They live by raiding the tribes and farmers that live around the blasted lands surrounding [[Mt. Fearg]], especially the [[Dugai]] tribe. There are lords of the lands near [[Shaadval]] who use them to raid northward, preventing the [[Hagfen]] from expanding (about the only good they do). They do herd [[wiresheep]] and [[trikine]] (both mutated creatures) and sell the [[wirewool]] from the sheep and incendiary "milk"  from the cows, distilling a form of lamp fuel from it.

Their leader is the dread warlord [[Gorrosh]], thought to be immortal (since he's been killed many times, yet has always resurfaced). He is a gigantic (~8' tall), purple-eyed orc who wields the greataxe [[Bloodstorm]], said to have belonged to the [[Red Fang]] before his demonic transformation.

Legends paint it as a quill pen the size of a tall man's outstretched arm, said to be a feather of the Creator itself. When you pick it up, spectral tendrils reach out and latch onto your arm; you write in the ink of your own existence.

What is known is the following:
* Under appropriate conditions (which are not generally known), this artifact draws in candidates from all over the world to the [[Eternal Library]] in [[Tal Elamor]].
* From those candidates, one gains the chance to wield the pen and write a Wish.
* In doing so, they cease to ever have existed. Everything that they did and said was done by someone else; all memory of them is erased as if it never existed. Only the Wish remains.
* Writers can fail; if they do, they cease from existence but the Wish is malformed and rejected, of no effect.
* The Wishes so written change the fundamental rules by which the [[Great Mechanism]] orders creation. Wishes that conflict with other directives or would leave the world in an inconsistent state are rejected; the writer and Wish has failed.
* Four such wishes have been successfully written throughout the ages (see [[Ages of the World]] for details).
* Once used, the Cosmic Forge becomes inert until its activation time looms again.

; Mouth : empties into the [[Craan River]] near [[Bradford]]

Entirely within the [[Duarchy of Kotimaa]], it is a significant vector of trade, second to the [[Craan River]]. Mostly wood products heading downstream and other goods flowing upstream. Navigable all the way to just below [[Cragholm]] itself, the river is wide and placid for much of its length.

It seems to act as a single lifeform, always trying to expand its borders. Outsiders are very not welcome--the land itself rises against them with strangling vines, moving swamp channels, and relentless attacks from both the residents and the wildlife (acting in concert).

It gets its name because the [[Mother Tree]] at the center of the fen is the patron of all [[hags]] and [[witchlings]], trading long life and power in exchange for their hearts, replaced by a parasitic fruit that feeds on particular emotions, transmitting them to the tree. Most hags, however, have never been to the fen itself; they contact the tree via rituals and dreams and the exchange is made via mystic means.

      <text bytes="9093" sha1="kzbr85tzd8dfhdl3g5w6ywxutfx2505" xml:space="preserve">A city located at the western edge of the [[Great Eastern Dustlands]]. Once known as the "Bridge between East and West," it was the chokepoint through which all east-west trade flowed during the latter half of the [[Ages of the World|Third Age]]. But its glory days are well behind it, and the decline is not solely due to the Cataclysm and attendant disruptions. [[Quan Pei]] which once dominated the entire eastern half of the continent had been in decadent decline for generations even before that, and the trade routes had become progressively more dangerous (and as a result less traveled) for about a hundred years. By 50 BC, the high roads and desert waystations had fallen into almost total disrepair and duster tribes had abandoned their treaty obligations to protect travelers (just as their reciprocal rights of trade and aid had been neglected). By 200 AC, the city's permanent population had dropped from nearly 100,000 to a mere 4,000. Over the following 50 years, the city has somewhat recovered as a home for mercenary groups who hire out in the bordering provinces of the [[Jinse Empire]] and [[Shaanti]] border protectorates, as well as who fight in the northern frontier vs the [[Hagfen]]. Its current permanent population is about 8,000, with another 2-3k mercenaries during the off season.

By treaty with its neighbors, Shaadval is neutral grounds. It stretches approximately two days ride (~60 miles) around the Triune Oasis that serves as the city's heart.

==Demographics==
The permanent population is broken out as follows:
* ~3500 humans and human-dominant crossbreeds. Use the Jinse phenotype (vaguely asian/feather indian look, tall, dark hair, medium-brown skin). Red hair and red-toned skin relatively common. Also heavily crossbred with ihmisi and orcs.
* ~1500 tieflings
* ~1200 ihmisi (and ihmisi-dominant crossbreeds). Darker and less forest-oriented, they've lost most of their kami worship and worship ancestors and devils.
* ~1000 goblinoids. Relatively civilized.
* ~800 orcs (and orc-dominant crossbreeds). Strong honor culture.

==Culture==
* Strong family/clan honor culture. Don't disrespect the elders. Polygyny is common (well more like concubinage + the male equivalent, generally temporary). Large age differences between dominant and less dominant partners are common (girls being married/given at puberty to a man in his 40s or 50s, boys in their teens being given to a woman in her 40s-60s). Children born of these concubines belong to the dominant partner's family, and such arrangements generally last only a few years. Some poorer families will serially sell their attractive children to several more powerful clans in turn in return for dowries. Concubines are generally treated well.
* Debt peonage is common, but non-generational. Maximum time limit (by law) of 7 years, although many end up getting hired back by that family again or marrying into the family. Not considered super shameful.
* Strong hospitality rules, especially among the Suu (and related clans). Sharing water is a covenant of peace…for a while.
* Devious infighting among clans behind smiling faces. Poison and assassins are not uncommon. Killed if caught, but that's about all.
* Essentially no nudity taboo inside. Relatively promiscuous. Use of magic/herbs to prevent disease &amp; pregnancy is very common. But by consent only. Rape or assault is punished heavily (an eye or a hand)
* Petty thievery is common and harshly punished if caught. But most don't take strong measures. The [[Uuru]] (thieves' guild) protects and polices their own.
* Scrupulous and fair, if hard bargained trade. Cheating is punished by exile or execution, especially cheating by adulteration of product or magical compulsion. Triumvirate guards (mostly Zhuun) watch the markets.
* Laws govern magic use. The Akild (Wise Ones) watch over and look for cases of magical compulsion or other such things. Known as the Red Robes (for the red robes and masks that they wear).

==Government==
Shaadval is governed by a Triumvirate--the family heads of the three most powerful noble families working together. The other noble families are mostly clients of these three. As of 250 AC, the Triumvirate is comprised of
* Ivars Zhuun (Lord Wool). The oldest of the three at 67, he remembers the disruption caused by the Dragonbotherers and is inclined not to trust adventurers. His chosen area of responsibility is trade. He has ties to the dragon-led nations to the south.
* Y'leni Bolota (Lord Steel). At 37, Y'leni is a hard-bitten woman who took leadership of her family after assassins (believed to be in the pay of Lord Shu of neighboring Shu Province) killed her parents when she was only 15. She believes in strength first. She has very few compunctions in playing the Great Game. She is largely responsible for interfacing with the mercenary companies.
* Maksim Suu (Lord Water). 38 years old, Maksim is of nomad blood (as is his Suu family, which traditionally takes wives from the neighboring duster tribes). He chafes somewhat at the Great Game. A highly honorable man, he believes in omens and traditions. His primary concern is the [[Dead Walkers]].

==Mercenary Companies==
Four major companies of various sizes call Shaadval home base and have some sort of continual presence in the immediate area. Others, as well as free-lance mercenary bands, also have presence in the city. The  four major companies are
* Gar'ok's Sappers. A specialized engineering company made up of orcs and goblinoids. At only 150 actives, they're the smallest of the companies. Only a few of them are currently present--most are involved in the siege at [[Jin Ro'pal]]. A brass gear on black, with a lit fuse
* [[Hoof and Bow]]. A specialized skirmisher double-company. A group of [[ihmisi]], they're related to the Altai and draw their recruits from there. 450 effectives, plus another 150 horsebreakers. They're in town after an early-spring campaign against incursions from [[Shaera]] into [[Shu Province]]. A hoof and a bow.
* Kalkan's Foot. A combined arms battalion (850 effectives). Traditionally strongest as heavy infantry, they've also acquired archer and skirmisher companies recently. Currently mustering out for an extended campaign on the border of the [[Hagfen]] on behalf of [[Shaanti]]. Iron cross, black on red.
* Rorlo's Raiders. A rough, somewhat cobbled-together group known for their effective use of magic and their lack of scruples as to jobs they take. About 500 effectives. Currently between contracts, they took this year off after a major contract the previous year. A key, white on black. Usually wear a tattoo.

==Neighbors==
* [[Shu Province]]. While technically part of the [[Jinse Empire]], they only pay token respect to the capital. One common property they have is their ready acceptance of diabolical aid. Constantly involved in border squabbles with the neighboring Shaanti Zhao Protectorate. Currently in possession of [[Jin Ro'pal]], a fortress city surrounded by [[Shaanti]] territory.
* [[Zhao Protectorate]] . Formerly part of Jinse, the Zhao rebelled and went over to [[Shaanti]] about 30 years ago. Not entirely cohesive, but backed by some very wealthy individuals. Continual struggles with Shu Province. They are allies with the [[Azeri]] and both contribute men and equipment in the containment efforts against the [[Hagfen]] to the north.
* [[Altai]]. [[Ihmisi]] tribal confederation. Horse and sheep. More tied in with civilization than most. Due to poorer lands, they hire many of their people out as mercenaries.
* [[Chuvashka]]. The traditional allies of Shaadval among the duster tribes. Detest the Dead Walkers, as they continually lose people to the heretics.
* [[Azeri]]. Orcs. Very superstitious. Militant and proud warriors. Don't mind the Dead Walkers all that much and are one of the few who willingly cooperate with them against the Hagfen.
* [[Dugai]]. A dying tribe, squeezed from all sides. Their only refuge is a rich oasis hidden in the broken lands. [[Peharzh]] in particular pushes on them, and weak leadership in the past has led many to defect either north or south.
* [[Bashkai]]. Once part of Dugai, they broke off about 40 years ago. They hate dragons.
* [[Pelotai]]. Orcs. Consider themselves the "true heirs" of [[Red Fang|Gromash]]. Honorable but brutal.
* [[Peharzh]]. Ruled by two dragon flights under the leadership of Pehar (an ancient Copper), the Peharzh tribes are aggressive and uncompromising. They'll take anyone that is willing to fight.
* [[Shaera]]. A pair of flights led by two ancients ([[Shar]], an ancient blue and [[Erai]], an adult Gold), they've actually made somewhat of a civilization out of local goblinoid and human tribes. After the idiotic behavior of the [[Dragonbotherers]], they have lost trust in outsiders. This trust was mostly restored by [[Enigma]] in late summer 250 AC. They regularly raid their neighbors and demand tribute (which Shaadval pays).
* [[Dead Walkers]]. Not direct neighbors, but their presence warps local politics.

;Numbers: 300 effectives. About 600 women and children and elderly.
;Culture: Value strength above all. Brutal raiders, preferring direct physical combat.  Status within the tribe by surviving/winning brawls. Not particularly underhanded. Women and children are non-persons and possessions, to be used by any who can. And if you can't protect your possessions, they belong to those who can take them.

As of late summer 250 AC, they were much more scarce than usual, as is their master, the adult black dragon [[Peharzh|Iruk]].

==Rules==
# Ascended heroes can only be in one place at a time; they cannot create avatars. Thus, if they are destroyed anywhere, they are destroyed everywhere.
# Ascended heroes can only interact across planar boundaries with mortals that worship them--there must be a pre-existing tie, voluntarily established by the mortal.
# Ascended heroes cannot annoint clerics, they can only teach spells and enter into pacts.
# The power of an ascended hero is directly proportional to the worship. Without worship, they must find another source of power to continue existence (ie become a devil or an angel or a demon).
# Ascended heroes *can* be proactive and *can* discriminate based on style of worship
# Ascended heroes are influenced by their worship and become the thing that their worshipers believe they are.

==Notable Heroes==
* The [[Queen Ascendant]]
* [[Nocthis]]

Once one of the more prosperous (for [[Dusters]]) tribes, they controlled a large portion of the east-west trade route through the [[Great Eastern Dustlands]]. When trade between [[Quan Pei]] and the west became moribund, they started on a decline. By 200 AC, they had suffered under weak leadership for several generations. The [[Bashkai]] split off in 210, taking most of the more forward-looking members. Tribes under [[Peharzh]] started raiding them, and with the resurgence in the [[Dead Walkers]] over the last 30 years, things have become quite dire for the Dugai. Only two of the tribes remain, and they only retain two strongholds. The first is the [[Dugai Oasis]] in the northern regions and the second is a hidden oasis in the center of their territory.

The northern tribal group is led by [[Azhtar Cai'Valur]], who had married [[Naomi of the Dugai]], the daughter of a Dugai chieftain. After she was slain by [[Dead Walkers]], he left to take his son, [[Ahzekiel Cai'Valur]] to safety. He later returned seeking vengeance against the one who commanded the assault.

Unlike that western empire, Quan Pei did not fall until the [[Cataclysm]] ripped their god-kings out from under them. And even then, the [[Jinse Empire]] has good claim to be the successor to that great empire.

Ruled by a succession of gods-made-flesh (actually mortals worshiped as deities) who claimed to speak for the [[Golden Aspects]], Quan Pei was both aristocracy and theocracy. Divided into a multitude of provinces ruled by bureaucrats and relatives of the god-emperors, it muddled along for millennia without serious incident. After initial unsuccessful attempts to expand into the [[Dragonreach]], a treaty was formed between the flights of that area and the god-emperors.

The capital was always at [[Jinse City|the Golden City]], now known as [[Jinse City]].

The city of magic. The home of the [[Eternal Library]]. Oldest city on the planet. Myth. Legend. Does it still exist? Sages believe that it can never be truly destroyed. But no one from the west has been there (or at least has returned from there) since the [[Cataclysm]].

== Locations Ca 252 AC ==

# Mekanix Workshop. Does it need to be mechanical? They make it. Including a bunch of things that probably shouldn't be mechanical.
# Kaz Rodan Smithery. All things hammered.
# Arin Kao Telecommunications and Transportation. We can get it there or tell you about it. As long as you don't ''really'' need it to be in one piece...
# Assisted Thaumaturgics. For all your will-probably-blow-up experimentation needs, at least the ones made out of metal, crystal, or wood.
# Corpus Sanum. True power comes from within, mostly by lifting weights.
# Pan-aetheric Unity. All things are one thing, except when they're different things.
# Mentis. True power comes from within, mostly by thinking about moving things.
# Dualistics. All things are different things, except when they're the same things.
# Temple of Self. True divinity lies within, we just haven't managed to dig it out yet.
# Temple of Fur. True divinity lies within cats, and we can prove it. Formerly sponsored by Absurdism, Inc, until it turned out to be more true than an absurd hypothesis.
# Top Alembic Recreational. Duuuuuuuude.
# Warin's Mutagenics. Don't like how you look? We can help. May take several tries, side effects may apply.
# Alia's Medicinals. We fix you up after you blew yourself up.
# Parin Chemical Supply. For all your will-probably-blow-up experimentation needs, at least the ones made out of liquids, gasses, or violently-bubbling concoctions.
# Annex. Everyone who wishes entry to the [[Eternal Library]] must check in here and meet the Caretaker of that place.

== Population ==
Inside the city: ~3k

Outwall Farms: ~5k

== Notable People ==

# The Caretaker. An amalgam of the people who have gained borrowing privileges (and thus left a copy of their personalities and memories at the library). Not a real ensouled person, but is the personification of the [[Eternal Library]]. Considered to be as unkillable as the library itself. Pissing him off is a bad idea.
# Arni Black-egg. Ancient black [[Dragons|dragon]], nearly 500 years old. Has been resident in Tal Elamor most of that time. Prefers the shape of a 5'2", 100 lb black-haired woman who rules Corpus Sanum with an iron fist. Also a proficient mage, but prefers to lift weights.
# [[Rhys]]. [[Undead|Lich]] and elemental mage. Unaligned, he doesn't belong to any of the factions.
# Gorgias Empiricus. Human male, 40s. Near archmage, leads Mentis. Strongly dislikes Arni.
# Haile Rastafa. Human female, 30s. Head of Tope Alembic Recreational.

She then became a notable adventurer and one of the group that cleared the grounds of the [[Crystal Spire]].

Physically, she's still very young (only in her 50s) and appears to be about 18. Considered extremely beautiful by the [[gwerin]], she is a wizard of some repute as well. She has not married, although pressure on her to do so is extreme.

Politically, she's just and fair, if sometimes a bit naïve. She's trying to make [[Crisial Kingdom]] a place of acceptance and peace for all, while favoring trade. She strongly believes in equal rights for all (even [[gwerin]] females and [[halfling]] males). She is '''highly''' opposed to necromancy, demon worship, or anything that smacks of magical oppression.

;Flaw: Tends to be too trusting.

She was delegated to the [[Pactum Battlefield]] containment project and assigned to guard the phylactery holding [[Atijok]]'s soul. Assigned the code name "Titziba", meaning "Faithful"--she was noted for her absolute dedication to the cause of the Host and the extirpation of evil. Over the two centuries of isolation in the constructed demiplane, this dedication turned to obsession and madness and she began to blame [[Atijok]] for everything.

Her isolation was broken by the [[Heroes of Pactum]], who entered the demiplane and managed to trick her into letting them grab the phylactery. They escaped with her hot on their heels; her attempted revenge was brought to an abrupt stop by the intervention of [[Melara]] and [[Ytra]], who claimed domain rights. When Titziba's madness was revealed, she was cast out of the Host. She then vanished into the mortal world.

The next year, she was encountered by the [[Wild Cards]] at the [[Dead Halls]], an ancient mausoleum high in the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] housing the cursed-into-stone bodies of [[Perkunos]] and [[Tatsuryuu]], where she was employing a form of necromancy to raise an undead army to destroy all life, because out of life comes evil, and evil must be stopped. The heroes put an end to that. In extremis, she called out to [[Oro-laen]], claiming to have been doing "his work." He briefly appeared, only to decry her as having abandoned her duty. This confluence of events was the trigger to awaken the cursed ancients. She died, and her sword (now known as [[Duty Denied]]) became the property of the [[Wild Cards]].

To some degree, it serves as the heart of the [[Great Mechanism]]--from here the devils of family [[Malphas]] (and much of Territory [[Thoraz]]) and their helpers carry out maintenance across the [[Astral]] Plane. Here as well are the forges and armories of the [[Angels|Angelic Host]], presided over by the 4th Legion of the 1st Host. It is said that there are direct portals from here to angelic outposts throughout the Dream.

Mortal visitors to the [[Machinarium]] are warned that the layout of the streets and buildings is not constant. Those who live here are sensitive to the changes (which follow their own logic and order), but visitors are often lost...or worse when things shift.

Posed (successfully) for many years as a sage of the [[Guardians of the Forgotten]], working to dig out information about the location of the [[mysterium magicii]]. Tricked the [[Vault Seekers]] into searching for the artifacts; this backfired when they became suspicious of him and discovered his nefarious ties. He was killed when a blood-soaked ritual he was conducting backfired due to counterfeits of the orbs, turning him into an undead/demon hybrid creature that was then slain by the [[Vault Seekers]].

Housed, supported, and maintained the [[Golden Army]]. Labor and maintenance provided by the [[peiriant gnomes]]. Control required a particular bloodline, now extinct with the [[Warden of Talvi]]. Limited access available through the [[Bloodstone Ring]], a failsafe designed to allow someone to shut it down. When the Vault was opened by an unauthorized person, the [[Golden Army]] would rampage, destroying all intelligent life and civilization within 20-30 miles of the location. This was not the original designed behavior, but one of the early effects of contamination by [[Awakener]] influence. It is unknown when this started, but certainly by the dawn of the Third Age.

The last authorized access to the [[Vault of Kings]] was during the mid-[[Ages of the World|Third Age]], when the last of the designated bloodline used the army to chase [[Juubokai]] into the prison known as [[Talvi]] so that he could be imprisoned there. Sometime during the later centuries (likely after the fall of [[Tibor Imperia]]), the vault was re-opened and a massacre ensued. In the aftermath, the [[mysterium magicii]], which served as portal keys to the vault, were split up so that no one else could try.

In 250 AC, the vault was opened via the collected orbs and access granted via the ring to the [[Vault Seekers]], working with Queen [[Raanee]] of [[Crisial Kingdom]] (who provided magical support via her court mages). The party entered the vault, made a deal with the remaining [[peiriant gnomes]] to lead them to safety, penetrated into the core of the vault, destroyed the [[Awakener]], and caused the vault to self destruct. The only member of the [[Golden Army]] to escape was Unit #8675309, who had become self-aware at some point. The uncorrupted gnomes and [[Adam of the Golden Army]], along with the party, managed to escape the destruction.

The appearance of endless numbers comes from the way that the [[Vault of Kings]] replaced lost members almost immediately via portal.

As of 250 AC, the remaining undead and other forces that occupied it have been mostly cleaned out, but the city still remains in ruins. There is significant debate in [[Wyrmhold]] about what should be done, while the more expansionist parts of [[Byssia]] want it returned to [[Byssia]]n control along with the rest of the caldera.

If it could conceivably be bought at sold, this market has it somewhere. Or has people who can be hired to retrieve it. The prices vary, however.

The [[angels]] of the Third Host have a strong detachment here to intercept any [[Awakener]] related merchandise, but otherwise they do not intervene. The market itself is overseen by [[Kela-Loran]]'s priesthood in the [[Plane of Stone]], made up mostly of gnomes, dwarves, and dao. The goddess herself has been known to frequent the market in disguise. The ostensible planar ruler, the god [[Korokonolkom]], does not patronize the market whatsoever.

Unlike the [[Utility Market]] of the [[Plane of Coal]], the Bazaar does little trade in intelligent slaves, although certificates of indenture and other instruments of servitude, as well as hiring contracts for more voluntary labor are quite commonly bought and sold.

Originally from [[Shinevog]], he uncovered records pointing to [[Tsagaz]]. In 247 AC, he made the trip there and, using a hidden entrance, snuck into the lower levels where he began experimenting on the Unawoken, sending them to collect parts from the [[Yavakh]] and mostly the [[Uldekh]]. When he was slain by the [[Vault Seekers]] in 250 AC, he had replaced everything but his head, which was placed in a jar inside the body of a misshapen construct. His insane ravings and mathemagical calculations covered most of the interior wall space of the northern side of the second level.

      <text bytes="2376" sha1="sb13f6gznkzj50xx2tu10e8845tk8ej" xml:space="preserve">The Waste is a layer of [[Shadow]] that should not exist. The Waste is formed when the other layers (the [[Border Shadow]], [[Mirrorhaven]], and [[Beastholme]]) get compressed into one by the passage of significant [[demons|abyssal]] influence. Usually, an area of the Mortal plane experiences a proliferation of demon summoning, [[blood magic]], [[undead|necromancy]] (specifically the creation of undead), or other massive trauma. This trauma and the passage of so many [[jotnar]] erodes the barriers between the layers and between the Mortal and [[Shadow]], resulting in a contamination.

In an area of the Waste, entry from the [[Abyss]] is facilitated and [[jotnar]] can leak through un-prompted. This often results in the contamination of spirits who dwell there after death, converting them into [[demons]]. [[Demons]] prowl, consuming souls. The land itself is twisted and barren, with hostile shadow creations springing up to plague those who dwell there.

Before the breaking of the [[Pact with Death]], it was the responsibility of the [[cysgoroesi]] to work to heal these areas, using the [[Ebony Rod]] and harp. They were assisted by devils, paid as mercenaries to fight the inner fight (much like the [[angels]] fight the eternal war on the outer boundaries of the Dream). Since then, only the efforts of the devils and the [[Blightguard]] have kept the waste somewhat in check.

The most frequent demonic troops seen in the waste belong to the [[Twisted]] and the [[Red Fang]]. The Jester, as well as [[Oro-laen]] and [[Lloitira]] have much less impact. In fact, the latter two have been known to surreptitiously aid in efforts to contain the worst areas of the Waste.

==Significant Wasted Areas==
; The Blight : Located correspondingly to the [[Great Eastern Dustlands]] of [[Noefra]], this is the biggest hot spot in all of [[Shadow]]. The [[Red Fang]]'s presence is strong here.
; The Ashlands : Located opposite of [[Moon's Fall Vengeance]], this area seethes with angry arcane-tinged demons.
; The Gnashing Fangs : Located opposite of the [[Blood-thirst Wildlands]], this area is still contaminated with [[Twisted]] forces.
; Thorn and Claw : Located opposite of North [[Ithemba]] in [[Soefra]], this is the (healing) remnant of the mark left by [[Lloitira]] and the [[Red Fang]]'s attempt to break through into the Mortal in 212 AC.

Visually a large (over 10' across) crystal in the shape of a dragon's heart, it was the crystallized remains of the [[Watcher]]'s mate, who perished in that primal conflict. Still bearing a trace of her soul in the form of a large cat-like being, the Heart was granted to the [[Cysgor]] as part of their [[Pact with Death]]. It resided at [[Lyo Duo]], where it formed the link between the [[Watcher]] (and his [[Gleaner]]s and their cat network) and the [[cysgor]] caretakers. In the days leading up to the fall of [[Lyo Duo]], it was contaminated with both [[jotnar]] and [[awakener]] influence. While the cat-spirit fought to contain the influence, preventing its spread, this was the catalyst for the breaking of that Pact and the abandonment of [[Lyo Duo]] to the waste.

For over four millennia, the three forces warred for dominance. On 9 Autumn Dawning, 250 AC, [[Enigma]] arrived and, wielding angel-made technology, entered the mindscape inside the gem and defeated both demon and [[awakener]] influence, freeing the Heart. It returned to the [[Watcher]]'s side.

In his transformation into the [[Red Fang]], Gromach threw it into the throne at the keep on [[Mt. Fearg]] and left a portion of his soul (accidentally) in the axe. This transformed it from a magical axe of no particular rarity into an artifact-caliber weapon, possessed of his grief, hatred (for the ones that slew his sister [[Serak]] as well as most living things), and nihilism, as well as most of his memories. It lay in slumber there for millennia, lacking a wielder.

When [[Torvald'vel'Orobas]] and his son [[Azhtar Cai'Valur]] entered the fortress in search of [[Awakener]] traces in ~220 AC, the demonic axe awakened (causing them to flee its wrath). Stretching forth its power in the wasteland that the area had become, it found like souls in the [[Dead Walkers]]. Manifesting a fragment of itself in front of likely candidates, it possessed them, transforming them into pale echoes of Gromach in his (mortal) prime. It used these leaders to gather armies; among which were the forces that nearly destroyed the [[Dugai]].

[[Enigma]] confronted the axe in its stronghold, battled through its illusions and "history lessons" and somehow evoked a fragment of [[Serak]]'s memory also embedded in the throne room where she was slaughtered by the [[First Heroes]]. Together, they banished an avatar of the [[Red Fang]] and shattered the axe, removing its malign influence forever and weakening the [[Red Fang]].

==Dealings with Mortals==
* He assisted the [[Dimwit Syndicate]] in freeing his beloved from [[Awakener]] possession as well as provided the angel-made weapon that allowed them to free the shard of the Third Moon from [[Awakener]] influence.
* He and his son attempted to penetrate [[Mt. Fearg]] into [[Lyo Duo]] in search of [[Awakener]] presence, but fled from the awakened [[Bloodstorm]].
* He gave [[Tsun Azur]] a tour of Shadow, showing her the conditions in the "afterlife". His reasons for doing this are unclear, but it is believed that he was working under divine orders of some sort.

* He has acted as [[Sakara]]'s agent in providing material support (in the form of divinely-marked gold coins) to the reconstruction effort at the [[Cherry Blossom Temple]]
* He delivered another angelic weapon to [[Enigma]] to allow them to enter the Gemheart mindspace inside of the [[Heart of Iska kel Pana]].

Was recruited/rescued by [[Gozh]] from the final battle at the [[Sleeper]]'s prison and became one of his lieutenants. He was tasked with leading a band of mercenaries to [[Mt. Fearg]] to recover the [[Heart of Iska kel Pana]]. When his band got caught in pitched battle with the [[Dead Walkers]], he was ambushed and slain by [[Enigma]]. His body was burned and his head crushed, making resurrection extremely unlikely. His enchanted scimitars were given to the captains of the [[Windbreaker]] and [[Golden Pearl]] as reminders and symbols of authority.

Landing on the western shores of [[Noefra]], the party is captured and sentenced to the arena. From there, they are recruited by the imperial mage, later to become [[Kul'Asad]], for a suicide mission to recover the "Book of Demons", an artifact said to contain the true names of many demons, currently being held by the people of [[Nocthis]]. They are teleported to a smaller city, recently captured by the forces of [[Imperial Meztli]], where they help the fugitive prince escape to the north. They travel with him, slaying a dragon on the way (which act lays the groundwork for [[Xol'cerd]]'s hatred of the [[dragonborn]], as the young dragon was her brother). They also meet a mage whose tower returned after the [[War of Souls]]. He later went on to free the [[Nameless]] and become that being's host during the [[Cataclysm War]].

Arriving in [[Hammerhead]], they make their way toward the [[Nocthean Caldera]], where they are captured and the truth is revealed--the "Book of Demons" is an unholy writ, being held safe from [[Kul'Asad]] and his demon-summoning ways by the wardens of [[Nocthis]]. They are exiled through a portal to [[Tal Elamor]].

The party, exiled through a portal from the [[Nocthean Caldera]], end up in [[Tal Elamor]]. There they take up adventuring, but are forced to withdraw from a crypt underneath the city populated by undead. Before they can retry, however, news reaches the city about the oncoming [[Cataclysm War]]. The party, along with many other novice adventurers, are sent on errands. These errands are, in large part, designed to keep them away from the armies as reserves.

Their particular errand was to search a lost temple dedicated to a forgotten goddess of luck and trickery for the fabled [[Eyes of Qa'desh|Right Eye of Qa'desh]], with the instruction to bring it back if they found it. They were never intended to actually find it--it was regarded as a snipe hunt. But find it they did, after navigating traps and defeating a rival group of the [[Nameless]]'s followers. Of course, they decided, once they'd gotten it outside and found out what it could do, to use it themselves instead of bringing it back to the Army of Order.

Each one of them made a request of it:

Those wishes were (in order of success):
# to become gods
# for the eye to self-destruct
# for there to be less magic in the world

Faced with those imperatives, this artifact of creation began to draw in [[anima]] from the entire world. So much so that it shut down all active magic (including magically-assisted flight) across the hemisphere. It then tried to implode (as required), but since it had drawn in a large amount of heavily-tainted anima from the [[Nameless]] and his Army of Chaos, that backfired, misaligning the elemental planes and threatening to send the entire [[Great Mechanism]] into ruin. Thus began the [[Cataclysm]].

The party? They got their wish to become gods. Their souls, stripped from their bodies, were chosen as three of the newly-called [[Congregation]], more for penance than for reward. They are [[Yogg-Maggus]], the [[Hollow King]], and [[Pinwheel]] (the latter being the one who wished for the destruction of the eye).

Death be my patron, blade by my wife &lt;/br&gt;
Breath is my witness, the road is my life &lt;/br&gt;
Must keep my long sword, as sharp as a knife &lt;/br&gt;
Never know who wants to play &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Cat’s in my shadow, wind's in my hair&lt;/br&gt;
Demons confront me, blood everywhere&lt;/br&gt;
Searching for hist’ry as I breathe sweet air&lt;/br&gt;
Seeking takes up all my days&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
When my foes fall down, &lt;/br&gt;
I am shadow bound&lt;/br&gt;
Mem’ry haunts, the Outsider&lt;/br&gt;
When the trail goes old&lt;/br&gt;
As the sun grows cold&lt;/br&gt;
No one holds, the Outsider&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Once killed a dragon&lt;/br&gt;
In a void filled with stars&lt;/br&gt;
Rescued a princess&lt;/br&gt;
A heart bears the scars&lt;/br&gt;
Uncontrolled shaking&lt;/br&gt;
Then earthward I fell&lt;/br&gt;
A mountain fell up to the ground&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Seems like I’ll never &lt;/br&gt;
reach my true home&lt;/br&gt;
Fated to battle, &lt;/br&gt;
doomed e’er to roam&lt;/br&gt;
The twisted, the slavers&lt;/br&gt;
No rest for the bold&lt;/br&gt;
The Dead Walkers' fetters unbound&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
When my foes fall down, &lt;/br&gt;
I am shadow bound&lt;/br&gt;
Mem’ry haunts, the Outsider&lt;/br&gt;
When the trail goes old&lt;/br&gt;
As the sun grows cold&lt;/br&gt;
No one holds, the Outsider&lt;/br&gt;

The Outsider!&lt;/br&gt;

The Outsider!

When I looked out my window&lt;br&gt;
A slender form in the dawn&lt;br&gt;
Striding through Honedax&lt;br&gt;
With spectral wings, and blade drawn&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He sought The Lady fae&lt;br&gt;
With comrades, one fine day&lt;br&gt;

You've got to enter timeless cave&lt;br&gt;
You've to risk an early grave&lt;br&gt;
Bring home the lost dwarf to enclave&lt;br&gt;
Whoaoaoaoa&lt;br&gt;
Young Rune looked spooky, but he's brave&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Took a boat ride, one morning&lt;br&gt;
Seeking a corrupted song&lt;br&gt;
In the depths found aberrations&lt;br&gt;
A shark's fury, merfolk wronged&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Found madness in the deep&lt;br&gt;
Victims tortured, made him weep&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You've got to enter madman's lab&lt;br&gt;
You've got to suffer psychic stab&lt;br&gt;
The Maestro's tentacles did grab &lt;br&gt;
Whoaoaoaoaoa Whoa&lt;br&gt;
Rune's spear thrust put him on the slab&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When I looked to the harbor&lt;br&gt;
Returning from the sea&lt;br&gt;
Heard Rune and his companions&lt;br&gt;
Report Confih-dent-ly &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Song made melody - from scream&lt;br&gt;
Town allied with the Crescent Dream&lt;br&gt;
Visit the Fae Queen, earn esteem&lt;br&gt;
Whoaoaoaoa&lt;br&gt;
Rune's fell blade earned its crimson sheen&lt;br&gt;

In a small seaside city&lt;br&gt;
Where the fish all smell pretty &lt;br&gt;
I first set my eyes on a halfling named Tsun&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
On his best friend Ebony, &lt;br&gt;
Smiting fiends vile and deadly,&lt;br&gt; 
Crying "I got, yer Kneecaps! Fall down, meet your doom!"&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Tsun saved our dear mayor&lt;br&gt;
Braved the Fae Queen's dim cavern&lt;br&gt;
Then under the ocean vile demons he smote&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Dealing blows to the Maestro&lt;br&gt;
Whose song hurt his ears so &lt;br&gt;
Crying "I got, yer Kneecaps! Fall down, meet your doom !"&lt;br&gt;

''- heavy metal riffs on Dil's magical cittern; hey, it's magic!- ''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Meh-tal face does shine &lt;br&gt;
Can he see or is he blind?&lt;br&gt;
There he stands so tall&lt;br&gt;
Swings his hammer, see foes fall&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Demons, filled with dread&lt;br&gt;
For their de-mise, no tears shed&lt;br&gt;
Serving Tor Elan&lt;br&gt;
Spreads his faith with each new dawn&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
-'' hard riff, dissonant chord - Yes, that cittern is a Stratocaster, why do you ask? - into the bridge'' -
&lt;br&gt;
No kin or family!&lt;br&gt;
He stares out at the world&lt;br&gt; 
Fights with dire passion&lt;br&gt;
Into pits demons hurled&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
- ''obligatory short solo, high speed shredding'' - 
&lt;br&gt;
Hammer, bloody red&lt;br&gt;
Fills miscreants full of dread&lt;br&gt;
Run far if they can,&lt;br&gt;
Flee the Fist of Tor Elan !&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bucaneer Dil - she comes from down South&lt;br&gt;
The loveliest bard in the North Country&lt;br&gt;
She'd taken her rapier, her pipes and her tambor&lt;br&gt; 
Serves Lord Sumter on land - and undersea&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
With Sargas and Morgan in cave she delved&lt;br&gt;
She helped Tsun to break up an ogre's knees&lt;br&gt;
The bandits they vanquished, the trade goods recovered&lt;br&gt;
With Crow then they set  Honedaxe mayor free &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(Chorus)
Bucaneer Dil, She must be&lt;br&gt;
As mad as a sailor without the sea&lt;br&gt; 
Bucaneer Dil, She must be&lt;br&gt;
The pluckiest bard in the North Country&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
She met with the Fae queen in caverns deep&lt;br&gt;
Taught orcs how to sing and to march with glee&lt;br&gt;
Then off to a temple, down under the water&lt;br&gt;
To rescue A Song, defiled evil- lee&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
They found refugees from the Crescent Dream&lt;br&gt;
A library full of bad poe - eh - tree&lt;br&gt;
A chapel with demon spawn and aberrations&lt;br&gt;
And Vos Caen prac-ticing sorcery !&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(Chorus) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So now the defilement is cleansed with steel&lt;br&gt;
The Maestro disrupted, The Song set free&lt;br&gt;
Leviathan speaks through the Serpent of Wisdom&lt;br&gt;
Honedaxe has returned to prosperity&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
(Final Chorus) &lt;br&gt;
Bucaneer Dil, She must be&lt;br&gt;
As mad as a sailor without the sea &lt;br&gt;
Bucaneer Dil, She must be&lt;br&gt;
The loveliest bard in the North Country&lt;br&gt;
(Repeat ad infinitum, for as long as the rum lasts ...)

Deep cavern in an icy peak&lt;br&gt;
The poisoned dragon lady lay&lt;br&gt;
Sleeping&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Her bardish friend called out for aid&lt;br&gt;
His lute's melodic song gently&lt;br&gt;
Weeping&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A soaring on their griffon mounts&lt;br&gt;
Enigma, dates with destiny &lt;br&gt;
Keeping&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
From blossom temple Zeke retrieved &lt;br&gt;
Kind Miloci, children was he &lt;br&gt;
Teaching&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In cavern cold did he unfold&lt;br&gt;
A pious copper dragon, be-&lt;br&gt;
Seaching&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The poison faded from her blood &lt;br&gt;
Zeke earned her thanks for selfless out-&lt;br&gt;
Reaching &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The bard's immortal praise intones&lt;br&gt;
Cai'Valur - walls of destiny&lt;br&gt;
Breaching

That crazy halfling &lt;br&gt;
And that loopy bard&lt;br&gt;
Brought you to light, ain't it grand?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Gettin' out of the hole&lt;br&gt;

Gettin' out of the hole&lt;br&gt;
You're free to rock and to roooo-lll&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Yer bud with blade and with wings&lt;br&gt;
Into the basement descends&lt;br&gt;
You free the children&lt;br&gt;
Break up the cult&lt;br&gt;
Homeward bound, make amends&lt;br&gt;

Enigma, &lt;br&gt;
Always on the road&lt;br&gt;
Problems solved&lt;br&gt;
Nemesis is Ghozh, (ozh, ozh) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Tsun was born&lt;br&gt; 
Rapier in his hand&lt;br&gt;
Kneecap's bane&lt;br&gt;
Against him they can't stand&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That's what they call us&lt;br&gt;
''(volume goes way up) &lt;br&gt;
~ wham wham wham ~ (guitar thrash and hard pounding kettle drum)'' 
The Enigma&lt;br&gt;
Dil, Zeke, Tsun, Rune&lt;br&gt;
''~wham wham wham~''
From Enigma&lt;br&gt;
Shadows flee their doom&lt;br&gt; 
''(volume goes down a bit)'' 
&lt;br&gt;
Gypsy souls&lt;br&gt;
Adventurers we're called&lt;br&gt;
Tore down shrouds&lt;br&gt;
Released the enslaved souls&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Burgs and towns&lt;br&gt;
They all know our names&lt;br&gt;
Shaera's friends&lt;br&gt;
Is a claim to fame&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And so they call us&lt;br&gt;
''(volume goes up) &lt;br&gt;
~ wham wham wham~''&lt;br&gt;
The Enigma&lt;br&gt;
Slavers our prey&lt;br&gt;
''~wham wham wham~ ''
From Enigma&lt;br&gt;
They flee or we slay&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
''(volume goes down a bit)''&lt;br&gt;
Dragon's son&lt;br&gt;
Saved from hunter's steel&lt;br&gt; 
Sleeping wyrm&lt;br&gt;
By prayer woke and healed&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Shadow's hold&lt;br&gt;
On mountain peaks is gone&lt;br&gt; 
Astral lich&lt;br&gt;
Expelled into the dawn&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Shadows shrink from us &lt;br&gt;

''(volume up)&lt;br&gt;
~wham wham wham~ ''&lt;br&gt;
The Enigma&lt;br&gt;
Bold, mad and fell&lt;br&gt; 
''~wham wham wham~'' &lt;br&gt;
The Enigma&lt;br&gt;
Ring freedom's bell&lt;br&gt; 
''(long guitar and drum riff, fade to quiet, until) &lt;br&gt;
~wham wham wham~'' &lt;br&gt;
The Enigma ''(aaaaaaaaaa - hold it, extend it)''&lt;br&gt;
Till the day we die &lt;br&gt;
''(fast strumming of A minor chord and then ending with 
~Wham!~''

Fang man, fang man, hold a little while&lt;br&gt;
I think I see Crow a-coming, sailing many a mile&lt;br&gt;
Crow, did you bring silver, dja bring a little gold?&lt;br&gt;
What did you bring me my dear Crow &lt;br&gt;
To save me from the Shadow’s hole? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I couldn’t get no silver, I haven’t got no gold&lt;br&gt;
I just brought my friends and valor&lt;br&gt;
To save you from the shadow’s Hole&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Fang Man, Fang Man, hold a little while&lt;br&gt;
I  see Bucaneer Dil comin’&lt;br&gt;
Sailing many a mile &lt;br&gt;
Oh Dil, do you have silver, is you purse filled with gold&lt;br&gt;
What did you bring me Dilly&lt;br&gt;
To keep me from the Shadow’s Hole?&lt;br&gt; 
What did you bring me, To free me from the Shadow’s hole?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The taxman took my silver, the bandits took my gold&lt;br&gt;
I brought my friends Tsun and Sargas&lt;br&gt;
To free you from the Shadow’s Hole&lt;br&gt;
Tsun and Sargas, to free you from the shadow’s hole &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Rune I do implore you, take her by the hand&lt;br&gt;
Bring her maid and gold eyed Zeke&lt;br&gt;
Take her from this forsaken land&lt;br&gt;
Take her, take her from this forsaken land&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Fang Man, Fang Man, upon your face a frown &lt;br&gt;
You heard them slay yer sorcer-or &lt;br&gt;
Bleeding in the street of the town&lt;br&gt;
Ya saw the pirates come chase them&lt;br&gt;
Ya saw your pirates fold&lt;br&gt;
Ya ran into your pyramid&lt;br&gt;
Hiding in your shadow’s hole&lt;br&gt;
Yeah they chased you, chased right back into your hole&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Fang man, Fang Man, &lt;br&gt;
The hubris in your smile&lt;br&gt;
Tell me of your dinner party&lt;br&gt;
Deceit and evil wiles&lt;br&gt;
Oh yeah you have a fine coffin&lt;br&gt;
You mist flows through the holes&lt;br&gt;
But now I laugh, Tsun staked your heart&lt;br&gt;
Buried in the Shadow’s hole&lt;br&gt;
Now I laugh, though the wind be glass&lt;br&gt;
Your buried in the shadow’s hole&lt;br&gt;
Fang man, Fang man&lt;br&gt;
Won't see you for a while&lt;br&gt;
I now return to elven home&lt;br&gt;
Sailing for many a mile&lt;br&gt;
My friends they came when I called them&lt;br&gt;
Audacious, wild and bold&lt;br&gt;
They came and put you in your place&lt;br&gt;
Buried in the Shadows Hole&lt;br&gt;
Buried, buried in your own shadow hole hole hole hole, &lt;br&gt;
Buried in your shadow’s hole&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div style="font-size:92%; line-height: 2.1em;"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Blinded by the smite, The Enigma ran up &lt;br&gt;
They was a-fightin’ in the night&lt;br&gt;
Blinded by the smite&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Zombies in the passage, comin’ out of wall coffins &lt;br&gt;
With a thirst for mortal blood&lt;br&gt;
But the blades and the blasties, did in the mooky nasties&lt;br&gt;
Then in the lair Enigma stood&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A beholder on her shoulder, Dil was feeling bolder&lt;br&gt;
When she leaped  up and grabbed his jaw &lt;br&gt;
Then the eye balls gazing, tazing and dazing&lt;br&gt; 
Made ‘em all duck, move and guffaw&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Yeah Enigma charged in and guffawed!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then it was Blinded by the smite, the Enigma ran up &lt;br&gt;
They was a-fightin’ in the night &lt;br&gt;
Blinded by the smite&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then fearless Rune zoomed, to the side of the tyrant&lt;br&gt;
And he laid some steel down hard&lt;br&gt;
While Tsun was a smitin’ and Zeke was by the column&lt;br&gt;
All those saves made him play new cards&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The big eye shone with a gaze of enervation &lt;br&gt;
That truthfully hurt their hides&lt;br&gt;
While Dil started swinging, and duckin’ and singin’&lt;br&gt;
"Hey guys, I hanging on for the ride”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
“Hell yeah, we’re all along for the ride!”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then it was Blinded by the smite, the Enigma ran up&lt;br&gt;
They was a-fightin’ in the night &lt;br&gt;
Blinded by the smite&lt;br&gt;
{repeat chorus}&lt;br&gt;
{break} &lt;br&gt;
Tyrants of the  Eye claim they're not afraid of the sun &lt;br&gt;
But Eye Lord, just wait 'til Tsun hits!&lt;br&gt;
{unbreak} &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
chorus&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Some tentacled walls tried to grab Zeke by the balls, &lt;br&gt;
So he danced a little misty step &lt;br&gt;
Then Porala got all tangled But the grabbers got all mangled&lt;br&gt;
Which let Rune his last blow prep&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Young Tsun he kept a-stabbin’ While Dil was mostly grabbin’&lt;br&gt;
And ducking so as not to die&lt;br&gt;
When Zeke laid the thunder Rune came out from down under&lt;br&gt;
And he struck it twice in the eye&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When Rune Struck it was the end of the Eye!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
‘Cos it was Blinded by the smite, the Enigma ran up &lt;br&gt;
They was a-fightin’ in the night &lt;br&gt;
Blinded by the smite...&lt;br&gt;
{repeat chorus} &lt;br&gt;
{pause}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
they had to send it through the gate&lt;br&gt;
They sent it through the astral gate &lt;br&gt;
{Instrumental}&lt;br&gt;
‘Cos it was Blinded by the smite, the Enigma ran up &lt;br&gt;
They was a-fightin’ in the night &lt;br&gt;
Blinded by the smite...&lt;br&gt;
{repeat chorus ad nauseum or until the rum runs out}&lt;br&gt;

{Guitar Intro}&lt;br&gt; 
Jahat Khema  is dead&lt;br&gt;
Lost in the northern waste lands, doomed by sin&lt;br&gt;
Jahat Khema  is dead&lt;br&gt;
Messed with the wrong buccaneer, he's done in&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He used to fly the astral plane&lt;br&gt;
Sail the Pearl in southern bays&lt;br&gt;
Sold loot and slaves along the quays&lt;br&gt;
Jahat Khema  dead&lt;br&gt;
Windbreaker A-venged!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jahat Khema  is dead&lt;br&gt;
Burned on a cart to ashes, blown by wind&lt;br&gt;
Jahat Khema  is dead&lt;br&gt;
Slain by vengeful sailor, and her friends&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He lost the Pearl to his shame&lt;br&gt;
Fled to the east, seeking new fame&lt;br&gt;
Had to take, an assumed name&lt;br&gt;
Jahat Khema’s dead&lt;br&gt;
Windbreaker A-venged!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{break, tempo change}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Along the coast you heard him boast&lt;br&gt;
About the Scarlet Pearl, &lt;br&gt;
Which instilled fear&lt;br&gt;
He raided trade routes, taking slaves&lt;br&gt;
Kids from their homes he’d nap&lt;br&gt;
And sell along the piers&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He sent assassins for an ambush&lt;br&gt;
Of Enigma,  the mercs laid down &lt;br&gt;
their spears&lt;br&gt;
He got a present from young Dil&lt;br&gt;
The severed head of those he sent&lt;br&gt;
And felt fear&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Jahat Khema’s dead
Windbreaker A-venged!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{break back to the original verse form, after a guitar instrumental}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He hired mercs to take the heart&lt;br&gt;
Enigma caught him, their blades sharp&lt;br&gt;
He burned to ashes on a cart&lt;br&gt;
Jehat Kema’s dead&lt;br&gt;
Windbreaker Avenged!&lt;br&gt;
Jehat Kema’s dead&lt;br&gt;
Windbreaker A-venged!&lt;br&gt;

{Guitar Intro} &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There’s a sailor that I knew&lt;br&gt;
Mathias was his name&lt;br&gt;
We rode the waves upon the Southern O-cean&lt;br&gt;
Our ship’s most able seaman&lt;br&gt;
My mentor, then my flame&lt;br&gt;
Someday soon, I’ll sail with him, someday soon&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Our Captain gave us warning&lt;br&gt;
There’s no romance on board&lt;br&gt;
But could true love be stopped &lt;br&gt;
by our comman-der?&lt;br&gt;
He caught us in the cargo hold&lt;br&gt;
It cost us both the lash&lt;br&gt;
Someday soon, sailing with him, someday soon &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Oh, when we got to port we’d hide &lt;br&gt;
And find our ways to play&lt;br&gt;
We learned to hide our love at sea&lt;br&gt;
And wait for better days&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So blow you cru-el trade winds&lt;br&gt;
Blow my love back to me&lt;br&gt;
When I wake up at night, &lt;br&gt;
salt tears I’m cry-ing&lt;br&gt;
He loved me true with all his heart&lt;br&gt;
He took that blade for me&lt;br&gt;
Someday soon, sailing with him, someday soon&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Oh, swam I did, and hoped I’d drown&lt;br&gt;
Into the deep blue sea&lt;br&gt;
The triton hunting party found me&lt;br&gt;
To land, they returned me&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now blow you astral trade winds&lt;br&gt;
Blow my love back to me&lt;br&gt;
When I wake up at night, &lt;br&gt;
salt tears I’m cry-ing&lt;br&gt;
He loved me true with all his heart&lt;br&gt;
He took that blade for me&lt;br&gt;
Someday soon, sailing with him, someday soon&lt;br&gt;
{slow tempo down)&lt;br&gt;
Someday soon, I’ll sail with him, some day soon&lt;br&gt;

==For a Cleaner Heart==
&lt;div style="font-size:92%; line-height: 2.1em;"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

Suspended in high places&lt;br&gt;
Enigma had to start&lt;br&gt;
To alter our reality&lt;br&gt;
With a cleaner heart&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Upon inverted mountain&lt;br&gt;
Right placement was a part&lt;br&gt;
The golden ball of Cai’Valur&lt;br&gt;
For a cleaner heart&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Bewildered by the prisms&lt;br&gt;
Assault by cold and flame&lt;br&gt;
Flying constructs, lightning bolts&lt;br&gt;
Defend the void domain&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Against the bold Enigma&lt;br&gt;
Geometry confounds&lt;br&gt;
The path to heart and destiny&lt;br&gt;
Star spawn are all cut down&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Into the void and chaos&lt;br&gt;
Bewildered, with no chart&lt;br&gt;
Seeking Iska kel Pana&lt;br&gt;
And so a cleaner heart&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
By violet and crimson&lt;br&gt;
Chained and bound was she&lt;br&gt;
Enigma leaped across the void&lt;br&gt;
To set the lady free&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Avast, the great void dragon&lt;br&gt;
With breath both bright and dark&lt;br&gt;
To burn the bard and sorcerer&lt;br&gt;
Their soul’s, flesh to debark&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But up rose that bold halfling&lt;br&gt;
His blade a lethal spark&lt;br&gt;
Astride the wrym’s great dorsal bone&lt;br&gt;
The rapier hit its mark&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The blade master, undaunted&lt;br&gt;
Destroyed the chaos fluke&lt;br&gt;
Withstood the dragon's lethal belch&lt;br&gt;
Sharp steel was his rebuke &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And so the chains were broken&lt;br&gt;
From void they did depart&lt;br&gt;
Returning to suspended mount&lt;br&gt;
To make a cleaner heart&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A prismatic eruption&lt;br&gt;
Blew them into the void&lt;br&gt;
The angels caught them as they fell&lt;br&gt;
Corruption was destroyed&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And so Enigma vanquished&lt;br&gt;
Designs of the dark art&lt;br&gt;
They sail ahead to destiny&lt;br&gt;
All with a cleaner heart&lt;br&gt;
{quick guitar riff} &lt;br&gt;
All for a cleaner heart!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I'll wipe your tears away&lt;br&gt;
For his soul, I’ll pray&lt;br&gt;

How far, how far did the sibling fall&lt;br&gt;
How far, how far {echo} far far far&lt;br&gt;

Some fall and it is just, that’s hard reality&lt;br&gt;
Vengeance fulfilled - why do I cry&lt;br&gt;
Hold close your loved ones, for tomorrow you may die&lt;br&gt;

      <text bytes="3002" sha1="6nl7e812zm6bibsk4zbnunhpaw50pyg" xml:space="preserve">==Beginnings, and Rats==
The party began in the Four-peaks Adventuring Academy, located near the dwarven lands at the eastern edge of the [[Flower Kingdom]]. Their first quest was to clear out the basement of a local farm, overrun by rats. As it happened, those rats were Of Unusual Size, and were being led by a mad druid, corrupted by the [[Twisted]]. Here, they learned of a threat in a nearby crypt, overrun with undead...and worse. There they found a group of necromantic demon cultists, working to summon Broken Hunger into the world. Their malign plot was stilled, forever.

==Crystal Stasis==
From there, they moved west toward the capital until they encountered a crystalline fortress, surrounded by crystalized soldiers, positioned as if attacking. This strange sight was surrounded by farmland, but hadn't been there a week ago (according to the locals). Investigating, they found it was a relic of the [[War of Souls]], taken out of time by a [[concept bomb]]. The heart was caught in a loop, with the inhabitants doomed to replay each day, dying over and over...and still remembering every blow of their thousand-year exile. The crystalized solders were still alive and thoroughly insane. Against these forces, the party struggled, but eventually was victorious, bringing an end to the curse.

==Capital Woes==
Heading to the capital of [[Lasiriand]] for some R&amp;R. Once there, the [[Shirtless Dwarf]] wanted to buy some of the drugs that he'd heard about. Accompanied by a few of the others, they made the purchase (which turned out to be powdered sugar, sold to rubes from the sticks). On their return, they encountered a trio of drunken nobles harassing (and more) a pair of serving women in an alley. At first they tried to dissuade them with words, when that failed, they turned to their swords. Unfortunately, one of the nobles killed was the king's youngest son, a noted wastrel. The party was arrested the next morning. Their trial was cut short by news of the [[Cataclysm War]] and the Army of Chaos bearing down on them.

==Gathering Allies==
The party was set free and assigned the task of seeking out the unicorn grove to the south and bringing those majestic beasts to the battle. This they did, despite having to destroy a dragon who threatened them. In its hoard, they discovered one of the [[Fangs of Resolution]]. On the way back, they traded that artifact to an old lady, who turned out to be an avatar of Primordial Life, the world itself. This being granted them blessings (described on the individual character pages).

==Battle and Aftermath==
The party, returning with the unicorn herd, participated in the [[Battle of Acceptance]]. In the aftermath, they (except the [[Shirtless Dwarf]], who wandered off after the chaos) were among the only remaining powers. As such, they led the refugees of the [[Cataclysm]] south, gathering more on the way. They founded [[Kaelthia]], and two of them still protect that land.

      <text bytes="755" sha1="pzwod787k0vxi1rca10oufzp4rj6uoc" xml:space="preserve">A human wizard. Born about 180 BC in the [[Flower Kingdom]] of a low-noble house, she enrolled at the Four-Peaks Adventuring Academy to escape her family and seek adventure. Joining the [[Refuge Seekers]], she was one of the centering influences in that band.

After the [[Cataclysm]], she was a major player in the founding of the [[Granite-Flame Academy]]. As she aged, she used arcane technologies, scavenged from before the [[Cataclysm]] (the same ones used to create [[Hound's Rest]], as well as [[IULIA]], but voluntary), to embed her consciousness in the building itself, becoming its guiding spirit.

With the new order (post [[Treaty of Rauviz]]), she has appeared less and less frequently.

His boon was to grow hard as stone, which he did in the final battle to protect his allies from harm. After the founding of the [[Granite-Flame Academy]], he settled down in its courtyard with his pets and completed the transformation, becoming the statue that still stands to this day. There are rumors that, if threats to the academy arise, he will stand up and take up his axe once more.

His boon was to become tough as an old oak, which he did during the final battle, shrugging off the axes and swords of the Army of Chaos. Unlike the rest, he wandered off shortly thereafter and took root on the banks of a river; to this day, it's said that if you sit under a particular oak, you can hear him whispering dirty words in your ear. Especially if you're a pretty girl.

As one of the Catalysts, she helped found the Federated Nations. She is also a hero of [[Wyrmhold]] for her efforts in the Winter War of 205 AC (see [[Catalyst Side Stories]]); as a result of the forces she led the Wall was completed, greatly lessening the threat of the [[Hungering Frost|Frost]]. In the final battle of that campaign she led a strike force against one of the frost giant leaders; his death was a turning point that led to the rout of the forces of Frost. Cheerful and calm, she is loved by the common people.

From then until 211 AC, she primarily spent her time founding the [[Quietus]] monastic school, training commoners and nobles alike in the way of meditation and unarmed martial arts. By 250 AC, she has retired as the active head of the school but remains the guiding master. She is not directly involved in politics, but is an honorary member of Clan [[Anu]]. She is still unmarried, despite significant courting from various noble families. She also serves as the local head of the Adventurer’s Guild.

;Demographic Information: Kalesin is a silver dragonborn female in her late 60s. She wears simple clothing and goes nowhere without her famous staff, [[Noggin-flogger]]. She also wields a returning lightning javelin. She prefers to hit things with her staff [[Noggin-flogger]].

;Personality Trait: I have a strong sense of fair play and always try to find the most equitable solution to arguments.
;Ideal: Respect. People deserve to be treated with dignity and respect.
;Bond: Those who fight beside me are those worth dying for.
;Flaw: If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it.

Since helping to found the [[Federated Nations]] as one of the Catalysts, he has been attempting to discover secrets of the [[Dark Beyond]] in the research of the ancient empires.  When he is not off on one of his many excursions to ancient ruins, he also the final arbiter of who will be allowed to become part of the [[Adventurer’s Guild]] in cases of uncertainty due to morality.  He is known to be ruthless when it comes to eliminating candidates who do not showcase the requisite moral fiber and attitudes. Tentacles are a significant theme. He heads the [[Order of the Seeking Tentacle]], an organization devoted to uncovering secrets and defending the world from aberrations and those from Beyond.

After the [[Crystal Spire War]] in 217 and the attendant attack on [[Hound's Rest]], Vassarian decided to take a more direct hand in the politics of the [[Federated Nations]] by taking personal and direct control over the [[Adventurer’s Guild]]. Over the next decade, and as a result of the [[Caldera Conflict]] of 220 AC, he turned its efforts more toward policing and maintaining order between the FNC members and less toward generalized adventuring. He has transformed it into an elite cadre of enforcers and agents riding herd over the [[Registered Companies]]. 

;Demographic Information: Vassarian is a handsome half-elf of indeterminate age with long dark curly hair and a matching beard.  He wears a black cloak made of a dead cloaker which engulfs most of him. He also carries the Rod of Cancellation, a simple silver metal rod about two feet long.  His constant companion is a small floating golem, known as [[Crit Bot]], a small ball of metal with a glowing blue eye. Mechanically he is a level 10 warlock, Pacted to a being from the [[Dark Beyond]]. He favors telekinesis as his answer to most issues.

;Personality Trait: Flippant and lippy. 
;Ideal: Strength should only be acquired to defend those who cannot defend themselves.
;Bond: Crit-bot, the Federated Nations, returning to the Dark Beyond.
;Flaw: Uniformly disrespectful of those in power who do not serve the best interests of everyone.
;Alignment: NG

The least politically involved of the Catalysts, Safrir co-founded the [[Lady%27s Grove|Lady's Grove]], the newest druidic circle (in the Ladyforest near [[Crisial of the Four Towers]]) with the ancient oak nymph Sara (see [[Tree and Child]]). Together they watch over the area, training new druids and woodsmen and educating the locals on the proper care of the land. The Lady's Grove specializes in weather magic and other plant-oriented spells. Rumors that he and Sara are involved are rampant.

While he still corresponds and assists the Adventurer’s Guild and the other Catalysts as needed, he mostly stays at home and trains his neophytes. His grove accepts all who wish to learn the ways of the spirits.

Personally, he’s kind and generous. He’ll help out with anything he sees as needs doing--he’s gotten his hands dirty with the harvest for peasants, participated in search parties for lost children and goats, and is generally loved by the people of the [[Crisial Kingdom]].

Demographic Information: a slow-aging (due to druidic power and Sara's influence) human male, he has dark brown hair, now shot with grey. His green eyes still twinkle, especially when around children. 


;Personality Trait: I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace.
;Ideal: Generosity. My talents were given to me so that I could use them to benefit the world.
;Bond: I will do anything to protect the [[Lady%27s Grove|Lady's Grove]] and my students.
;Flaw: I’m naive and trusting, willing to always believe the best of everyone, even if they’ve showed otherwise.

Paresten is the most politically active of the Catalysts. He is deeply involved in the day-to-day operations of the [[Federated Nations]] as the Counselor who oversees the [[Adventurer’s Guild]], as well as the council’s Treasurer. He makes no bones about his desire to increase his own wealth and prestige; he just does this by making his operations successful. After the attack on [[Hound's Rest]], he stayed in the newly-formed Holy Kaelthian Republic, where he has significant political influence. He travels through the portal network on a constant basis raising funds and handling issues with suppliers for the Guild.

He also founded House [[Tai Nwyedd]] (which translates to “New Blood”). The least conventional House, it is a matter of some contention among the other gwerin. It draws from the young, the disaffected, and the passed-over. It grants rank based on merit alone, not bloodlines. But it considers more than just arcane power. Unlike other houses that arrange mating contracts, Tai Nwyedd allows the members to act freely. Tai Nwyedd is also heavily involved in international trade; rumors paint them as also being tied to the [[Mockers]].

Personally, he’s arrogant and contemptuous of his lessers. He treats the rest of the Catalysts as his servants in public; they mostly just roll their eyes and play along. Earlier he fought duels frequently (due to offending lots of people), but the trail of bleeding courtiers he left behind put an end to that.

Demographic Information: A middle-aged (mid 70s) [[gwerin]] with golden-blond hair and fair features. He still wears armor (which scandalizes many matrons of high society). Unmarried (despite many attempts), he’s popular with the ladies. He dual-wields rapiers (one of which is blessed by holy fire; the other is enchanted against giants) and is a lethal swordsman as well as a mage. He doesn’t fight fair, though.

;Personality Trait: Arrogant, elitist.
;Ideal: Greed. I'm only in it for the money.
;Bond: The Federated Nations Council is my work and I will protect it at any cost.
;Flaw: I'm too greedy for my own good. I can't resist taking a risk if there's money involved.
;Alignment: Chaotic Neutral

Born in a small village of [[Usko Ffyd]], this [[gwerin]] woman suffered the tragic loss of her parents and her entire village in 206 AC to the [[Imperial Sons]] and their twisted research goals. Four years later, she joined the ranks of the Sanctioned Adventurers and together with Mope investigated and ended the threat from [[Imperial Research Alpha]] and its twisted, dragon-obsessed master. Later that year, the pair of them joined Quickleaf and Iseis at [[Godsfall]], where they proceeded to make history.

After the liberation, she studied at the [[Granite-Flame Academy]] in [[Kaelthia]] as a visiting scholar, she has begun to gather a band of fellow afficionados who yearn to discover the ultimate secrets of the universe and make them accessible to the common man. Her motives are rather different than most--she wants recognition and celebrity (and wealth). This band calls themselves [[DISCOVERY]] (Dedicated Investigatory Society Centered on Vastly Energetic Research—Yonwach branch), and has published their inaugural broadsheet. Her own specialty is the nature of life and death; she is affiliated with the College of Necromancy (despite not sullying her pretty hands with the actual raising of undead).

After the collapse of the [[Council Lands]], she moved her operations to [[Crisial of the Four Towers]], where she and [[DISCOVERY]] are currently headquartered.

;Demographic Information: At 6'5", she's tall for a gwerin woman but nonetheless beautiful. Still relatively young (in her mid 60s) and wealthy as a result of her adventures, she is a prime target for all the noble Gwerin houses. A consummate flirt, she leads many of them on but refuses to commit to anything. As a divine boon, she can absorb one spell per day.

;Personality trait: Compulsive kleptomaniac and swindler.
;Ideal: Celebrity. She wants to be recognized for her power and glamour.
;Bond: Fair treatment of women.
;Flaw: Impulsive and distracted by glitz and glamour. Loves the high life.

Also born in [[Usko Ffyd]], Quickleaf learned both respect for the [[Kami|kami]] and a smattering of arcane magic (unusual for an [[Puun Ihmisia|ihmisi]]). Although the tragedy that befell the town was not aimed as personally at him, he was still caught up in it and orphaned. He joined the [[Mockers]] in [[Kaelthia]] soon thereafter and made a name for himself as a capable sneak-thief until he was recruited for the Sanctioned Adventurers program in 209 AC. He and Iseis were the first SA's into [[Godsfall]] and were instrumental in the events there.

Armed with his skills, a bracelet that granted him invisibility and fireballs, and a strong sense of justice, Quickleaf then returned to [[Kaelthia]] and joined with a fellow adventurer (nicknamed [[Windshadow]]) to create the [[Sheltering Hands]], a loose organization dedicated to feeding and assisting the poor, orphans, and other unfortunates throughout the [[Federated Nations]]. Disdaining public recognition, they have quietly acquired contributions from some of the wealthier residents (whether they knew they were contributing or not is a different question) and move wherever they see a need. This work continues to this day, although as he's aged, both he and Windshadow have stepped back from the more physical parts of the job into more administrative roles.

;Demographic Information: Quickleaf is an older (60s) [[Puun Ihmisia|puun ihmisia]] male. Of middling height and build, with no notable features other than a metal bracer he wears on his left wrist, he blends in easily and prefers it that way. Mechanically, he favors two-weapon fighting.

;Personality Trait: Goes invisible at the first opportunity, but will charge into the middle of a pack of bad guys in the name of justice.
;Ideal: Charity. Help others, even at a cost to yourself.
;Bond: No one else will have to suffer as I did if I can help it.
;Flaw: Stubborn to a fault.
;Alignment: Neutral Good

Iseis was born a commoner in the Southern District capital of [[Kel'al'ar]]. He joined the city watch in the upheaval following the [[Dark Lady]]'s demise in 205 AC and quickly rose to the rank of Lieutenant Investigator. Growing restless with the political infighting and becoming frustrated with noble interference in his duties, he left the force when he was recruited by the [[Adventurer's Guild]] in 209. He and Quickleaf were assigned to handle the [[Godsfall]] matter. His knowledge of politics and diplomacy served him well there--he was instrumental in the formation of the [[Godsfall Alliance]] and personally conducted many of the negotiations required to get that fractious bunch to cooperate.

He gained the ability to slip through solid matter (a Boon of Questionable Solidity), the trust of all of the local groups, and the Divine Champion armor set that predates the Cataclysm. After the death of [[Kul'Asad]] and the ascension of the [[Archon of Time]], he spent the winter in [[Godsfall]] helping to coordinate and stabilize the nascent government. In early spring of 211, he left [[Godsfall]] for parts unknown. Years later, right near the founding of the [[Duarchy]], he returned and was (unwillingly) crowned one of the rulers of that new-born nation.

;Demographic Information: Iseis is a 60-ish [[Humans|human]] (fang-kin) male. Thoroughly average in appearance, other than his alabaster-and-gold armor and glowing sword (all it does is glow), he prefers to find alternate routes and makes elaborate plans. Actually hitting things with his sword is rather secondary.

; Personality Trait: I never think in straight lines.
; Ideal: Diplomacy is a first, second, and preferred approach to every problem.
; Bond: I solve problems. Don't get in my way.
; Flaw: Twisty thoughts often cause needless complications.

Not much is known of the backstory of this most enigmatic of the four heroes. Preferring to spend her time in the shape of a huge bear, she can be counted on to take the most random approach to any possible situation. How an [[tiefling|infernal plane-touched]] picked up druidic ways is unknown. And everyone who asks her gets a different answer.

She worked with Saeth to solve the [[Imperial Research Alpha]] issue in the spring of 210, and then joined forces with those at [[Godsfall]]. Her erratic ways left her somewhat out of the picture for most of that campaign, although she gained the trust of the Kindred and spent some time with them. After that, she characteristically departed suddenly, saying "I want to go find something to eat," and never returned. Accompanied by her pet/companion/kindred soul, a giant lizard that bonded with her in the jungle and served as her stalwart friend and fellow connoisseur of interesting and questionable foods, she's probably still out wandering, munching on creatures that annoy her (with two, four, or any number of legs, to be quite honest). Or has died. No one's quite sure.

;Demographic Information: Mope is a infernal plane-touched in her 60s (if she's still alive), with characteristic horns, tail, red skin, etc. Private Eyeguana is a large, strangely over-developed, green-scaled giant lizard who wears custom plate barding and is prone to flying into blood-rages. Armed with her spells, her forms and an array of mysterious mushrooms that have rather random effects, she is liable to turn up whenever situations need to be more...random.

;Personality Trait: Can be counted on to take the most unexpected path through any situation.
;Ideal: Freedom. Chaos, in fact. Do the unexpected.
;Bond: Private Eyeguana. The two are inseparable.
;Flaw: Totally unreliable. In fact, reliable at being unreliable.
;Alignment: Chaotic Chaotic. Not even neutral (good vs evil). Chaotic. She makes denizens of pure chaos look predictable and ordered.

She leaped up to &lt;br&gt;
mount the dragon - bestrode his spine&lt;br&gt;
A family scene,&lt;br&gt;
Tsen her flanker on the ground&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Watching the griffon jump to the sky&lt;br&gt;
Chop up her little ex was her intent&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Under a hazy sky&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Taunt him into a fatal mistake&lt;br&gt;
Time and distance closing in&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Fly up, fly up, fly up&lt;br&gt;
The sky is where they fight&lt;br&gt;
Then the smite lands true,&lt;br&gt;
She felt gravity pu-ull {drawn out word}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{guitar phrase}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The bait he took because she said&lt;br&gt;
"You don't satis-fy, but Tsen does"&lt;br&gt;
Raging mate, positions shift&lt;br&gt;
Cuckhold dives to dragon's back&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Under the hazy sky&lt;br&gt;

Slender sword and hungry axe&lt;br&gt;
The wyrm's jaws clamping down&lt;br&gt;

Fly up, fly up, fly up,&lt;br&gt;
The sky is where they fight&lt;br&gt;
When the smite lands true,&lt;br&gt;
She felt gravity pull - {key shift/rhythm shift} -&lt;br&gt;
Her down, toward the ground&lt;br&gt;
Staring straight up, eyes big and round&lt;br&gt;
This was failure like she'd never had ...&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
She fell down and into darkness, body broken&lt;br&gt;
A surreal scene of her tool Tsen in Griffon's claws&lt;br&gt;
Spiral flight, his sword still slashing&lt;br&gt;
Then he falls from higher up, hits the dirt hard&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Under a hazy sky&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The dragon shakes Tusn from his back, he falls to her&lt;br&gt;
Time contracts, he floats down like a feather falls&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Fly up, fly up, fly up&lt;br&gt;
The sky is where they fought&lt;br&gt;
When the smite struck true,&lt;br&gt;
She felt gravity pull, her down.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{Guitar and instrumental to a fade to the end}&lt;br&gt;

When he was captured by the [[Council Lands]] authorities and sentenced to death (for disrupting the social order), he gained the chance for a reprieve if he promised to dedicate his life to helping the small town of [[Yuuras Zaali|Yuuras Zali]] (now [[Crisial of the Four Towers]]) along with the other members of [[Fire, Stone, and Cold]]. He complied. After the group won their freedom as part of [[Family Pain (Campaign)]], he dedicated his life to feeding the poor and hungry. He and [[Quickleaf]] of the [[Godsfall Champions]] formed the [[Sheltering Hands]]. They travel incognito around the [[Federated Nations]], taking donations (not always willingly given) to help the lot of the poor (usually in secret).

Doethian died about 100 years after the [[Cataclysm]] and the house stayed empty (nominally owned by various individuals but never inhabited) until the [[Catalysts]] received it as payment for their deeds in 205 AC. The reason for the long emptyness as well as the state of repair (which was abnormally good) turned out to be that the house was haunted--the High Mage had been experimenting with [[Blood Magic|soul pinning]], attempting to anchor ''willing'' souls into structures to serve as a guiding intelligence. His work was used by [[Katheryn Archmagus]] to pin her own soul into the [[Granite-Flame Academy]], but he himself was only able to embed the awakened soul of his favorite pet into the house.

Currently, the house serves as the residence of [[Vassarian Kabir]] as well as an administrative center for Guildtown (the [[Adventurer's Guild]] outpost that has swallowed the small suburb outside [[Kaelthia]]).

==Kanin and Spouses==
; Family Head : Kanin. An elderly man, he has been sickly for several years. Married to Chaman .
; Wife : Chaman ne' Dahal. Retiring and elderly, she has little influence in the family affairs. Mother of Pran and Akkanee, adopted mother of [[Azhtar Cai'Valur]].
; Concubine : Minkuna ne' Rana. Much younger and aggressively ambitious. Mother of Nada and Praman.

==Children==
; Pran (48) : Eldest son, but estranged. Gay, living with his dwarf lover (Khael) in [[Sha'slar Autonomous Zone]] as a weaver. Has renounced his name and title. Personality: camp.
; Tuyaen ne' Kelap(39): [[Azhtar Cai'Valur|Azhtar]]'s "widow". Despises him secretly, but conflicted toward Ahzekiel. Addicted to snakeweed (pot, basically, except not so mellow). Follows Mikuna's lead but tries to undercut her. Praman's lover for many years, but now they're separated (after Praman cooperated and prompted Azhekiel's enslavement) and she's got a string of boys (her "servants"). Clingy. Mikuna is trying to get her married off again.
; Nada (38) : Married to a much older Serpent Dominion noble (Isal Sat'psa Turan, a relative of the Sat'psa clan). Glad to be out of the poisonous Rana family.
; Praman (34): Handsome, noble, the face of the family. A shrewd businessman, he organized the opening of trade across the Northern Wilds. Father of Vou &amp; Chesdan. He and Mikuna work together. Connected to the Organization, ambition is to rise to the Board. Heavily courting a wide array of noble women. Unofficially the acting heir as far as anyone else is concerned, very dedicated to making that status formal.
; Akkanee (30): Beauty, partially trained as Temple Dancer (but kicked out for an act of jealousy). Widow of a much older noble. Had a child by an ophidian servant (Jara, a boy of 12). Was left only a pittance in the will when he died about 6 years ago. Still bitter about that. Dabbles in magic (divination). Has a parade of lovers of both sexes. Prefers ophidians. According to rumors, she especially prefers the [[Ophidians||Isal'psa]], the less humanoid the better.
; Vou (20): Child of Praman and Tuyaen, although officially Zeke's younger sister. Self-centered, spoiled, hedonistic. Engaged to be a concubine to Phra Phel Solkan's eldest son, Phel Melan (age about 45).
; Chesdan (16): Child of Praman and Tuyaen. Naïve, enjoys power and prestige but doesn't know the details. Currently being shopped as a concubine of Lai So Lender's daughter (Lai Pe Lender, age 50). Not entirely happy with that. Somewhat idolizes Zeke, very secretly.

==Initial Events==
* [[Ahzekiel Cai'Valur]] joins the party after the departure of [[Sargas of Tor-Elan]] and [[Crow]].
* The party visits [[Zhapai Karmap]] and then [[Creche Skeud]], where they learn the truth about the events there and learn more about the fall of the [[Cysgoroesi]] and about [[Rune]]'s father.
* The party returns to [[Fort Hope]], where they're instrumental in breaking up a [[Twisted]]-influenced slave ring involving animal/humanoid chimera children. The rescued children (about 20) are taken to [[Cherry Blossom Temple|Heroes' Rest]], where [[Tson Azur]] is rebuilding.
* They confront Ahzekiel's family, leading to improved relations...
* Unofficially acting for the [[Adventurer's Guild]] and in search of personal knowledge, they head east to [[Shaadval]]
* To open up trade after the idiotic actions of the [[Dragonbotherers]], they head into [[Shaera]].
* En route to [[Erathi Village]], they encounter challenges such as
** They are ambushed by a mercenary force sent by [[Jahat Khema]]. This force is humiliated and the assassin's head is sent back as a friendly warning.
** Their help is requested by a djinn of the [[Plane of Wind]] to track down a behir before his rival, a slave-trading dao, can. They find the dao outside the behir's cave and proceed to humiliate him (including having him polymorphed and placed in a fishbowl for dolphins in the [[Plane of Ocean]] to play with), making an enemy. They proceed to slaughter the behir, learning the truth of their increased power. And the benefits of climbing on big things (starting the pattern of the Orbital Halfling Drop).
** Later on, they encounter a group of Erathi villagers trapped by a nest of acid-spewing giant ants. They solve it in their usual violent fashion, with much exploding bug guts.
* They befriend the dragon [[Erai]], mainly by plying her with copious quantities of very strong liquor. Don't worry, she's a consenting adult.
* Seizing the opportunity to assist [[Ki-larn]] and gain her trust, they head west into the [[Ladyfrost Mountains]], where her son, [[Miloci]] has gone missing.

==Ladyfrost Mountains==
* Here they encounter "shrouds", areas that have been pushed halfway into [[Shadow]] by rogue [[cysgoroesi]] serving former abbot [[Arnyek]].
* They rescue [[Miloci]] from pursuers.
* They sneak into [[Arnyek]]'s stronghold in one shroud and parlay with him, regaining some of [[Rune]]'s memories
* They then meet the [[Immortal Bard]] and the sleeping [[Marcia (Dragon)]].
* With their assistance, they (temporarily) defeat the lich [[Xel'na]] and gain significant power, as well as ending [[Ahzekiel Cai'Valur]]'s contract with [[Oro-laen]].
* They then slay [[Arnyek]].
* The shrouds collapse.

==Interlude==
* The party has to deal with threats to [[Cherry Blossom Temple]] and manages to defuse a war, seemingly being promulgated by the [[Holy Hands]].

==Mt Fearg==
* They take their (interrupted) journey from [[Shaadval]] toward [[Mt. Fearg]] via [[Dugai]] territory.
* They break the siege of [[Dugai Oasis]] and encounter [[Azhtar Cai'Valur]].
* They (again) defeat [[Xel'na]] while she guides an army under the command of [[Jahat Khema]] toward [[Mt. Fearg]]. Jahat is utterly destroyed.
* Entering [[Mt. Fearg]] from the catacombs, they defeat an eldritch abomination of an undead eye tyrant with the assistance of [[Ios al'Tor]] and [[Porala al'Tor]].
* They are forced to endure historical visions of [[Bloodstorm]], a fragment of the [[Red Fang]]'s pre-ascension soul now housed in an axe.
* They defeat phantasms of the [[First Heroes]] and destroy [[Bloodstorm]].
* Entering [[Shadow]], Dil sings for devils, one of whom records the performance and sells it to the devils of [[Diabolical Families|Beleth]].
* Wandering through the non-Euclidean space of [[Lyo Duo]], they recover a piece of the [[Ebony Rod]] as well as tokens of the original seven [[cysgoroesi]] septs.
* They cleanse the [[Heart of Iska kel Pana]].
* [[Mt. Fearg]] and [[Lyo Duo]] collapse entirely, leading to earthquakes that last for a while.

==Interlude==
* Dil performs in [[Crisial of the Four Towers]], drawing significant attention and revenue.
* The party goes shopping in the [[All-Things Bazaar]], where they learn that Dil's songs have been ripped off by house Beleth.
* Dil and Tsun confront [[Bela'ka'Beleth]] and win contractual rights and residuals.
* Azhekiel learns a bit more about his grandmother and the meaning of the green eyes.

==Dealing with Family/Southern Excursion==
* With draconic assistance, they head off [[Nyx Astra]] and [[Tsen Azur]], along with their compatriots, at the entrance to the [[Gardens of the Fallen]]. Nyx and Tsen are slain. Iruk informs them of [[Gozh]]'s secret southern lair.
* Rune meets [[Selai]], an elderly [[cysgor]] who seems to have a lot of knowledge about his past.
* They arrive in the secret lair, where they are honey-trapped by [[Gozh]] and parlay with him.
* They meet the [[Qu-ti]] [[zandolit]], where they learn of a group of green-eyed [[ophidian]]s who worship the [[Coiled Ones]].
* They try to parlay with the Speaker for the Cold Mother, but hostilities break out when the party is asked to partake in a ritual feast featuring the flesh of enslaved [[zandolit]] and other sophonts.
* After defeating the Speaker, they venture into the ancient temple dedicated to the [[Coiled Ones]], where they gain the blessing of the spirits of the original builders (who were not worshipers of the [[Coiled Ones]]) and defeat the avatars of the [[Coiled Ones]].
* They parley with a summoned devil, who tells them that it has been conducting research into optimizing the output of worship. [[Gozh]], it seems, has been participating in this research.
* Returning to the [[Qu-ti]], they engage in a verbal joust with [[Gozh]] himself, attempting to convince the leader of the tribe to abandon [[Gozh]].

==Interlude 2: Astral Boogaloo==
* Dil and Tsun spend the next few weeks crafting scrolls.
* Zeke travels south to visit the [[Lower-city Clinic]] in [[Kel'al'ar]], where he learns that the clinic was raided by a green-eyed follower of the [[Coiled Ones]], confirming that the beings are watching through his eyes. He also receives an invitation to visit with a "friend" of the [[Old Gods|Rainbow Serpent]] in the [[Astral]], which he does. There he receives a talisman that will temporarily keep the [[Coiled Ones]] out of his head, while he considers the offer of devoting himself to the [[Old Gods|Rainbow Serpent]] for permanent relief.
* Rune gets gifts for the party and has a lyre crafted.
* He also scries on [[Leah of the Orsa|a cysgor woman he knew]], and is surprised to see her alive and conducting an operation in (as it turns out) [[Toryuu City]].
* Tsun and Zeke meet [[Betsy Farthingale]], [[Tson]]'s fiancée and the grand-daughter of the former yarl of [[Bradford]]. They deed most of [[Hero's Rest]] to [[Tson]] as an early wedding gift, making him a major land-owner.

==The Dragon Congress==
* The party arrives on [[Toryuu Island]] and is immediately overcharged for everything and condescended to.
* Dil puts on a rocking concert, during which Rune sees (and chases down in the stree) one of the [[cysgor]] women that Leah was talking to. They seem to be watching [[Selai]], who has wrangled a place in a dragon delegation. And [[Erai]] gets really really drunk. Not that that's too unusual.
* The party, with help from dragons, finds out that there's a "venting ritual" planned for the exact wrong time, and head out to find a way into the lava tunnels under the volcanic lair by investigating a sinkhole seemingly caused by separatist/rebel dwarves in the slums of [[Toryuu City]].

Said to have great power over [[Shadow]]. Currently in three pieces. One of those pieces is held by [[Enigma]]; the whereabouts of the other two are uncertain, but it is believed that the heads of the Raven and Magpie Septs each have one.

Edit: as of 1 Winter Dying 250 AC, the rod has been reunited. Until a new cysgor Prime is chosen, it has chosen to adventure alongside [[Rune]].

== Personality ==
Quiet, no nonsense. Strongly dislikes [[Awakener]] and all related entities. Takes action first and asks questions...never?

== Powers ==
The ebony rod is a morphing weapon, capable of taking on the shape of a +3 quarterstaff (the default) or a +3 longsword whose blade is edged in force (dealing +2d6 force damage on a hit). In either form, it has the following abilities in [[Rune]]'s hand (each wielder gets slightly different properties):

* Two "floating" warlock invocations, switchable at the end of a long rest. Rune counts as having all his class levels in warlock for prerequisites for these invocations.
* A flying speed equal to his walking speed, as the rod creates footholds made of force under his feet.
* As an action, close any portals within 30' OR as a reaction, keep any portals (such as due to a teleport effect) open for 1 minute.
* 7 charges, which can be used in the following fashion (regaining 1d6+1 at dawn)
** 3 charges: regain a warlock spell slot as a bonus action
** 4 charges: heal HP equal to the damage dealt during this turn, with extra becoming temporary HP
** 2 charges: All creatures within 5 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw against the Spell Save DC. On a failure, they take 4d12 force damage and their speed is reduced to 0 until the end of their next turn.
** 1 charge: Ranged spell attack (120 ft), one creature. Hit: 4d10+5 force damage and the creature is teleported to a point of Rune's choosing that he can see within 120 feet of him.

== Discoveries (250 AC by Enigma) ==
The Coiled Ones (and the Rainbow Serpent) are all that remains of the nobles of the [[Fanged Kingdom]], who cut a deal with the [[White Skull]] for the secret to apotheosis, to ascension to godhood. But the ritual failed (in part because they didn't read the deal closely and didn't realize something was missing). Instead, all the [[gwerin]] ended up in a lightless oubliette of a demi-plane, a prison in the [[Astral]]. There they subsisted on each other's Names (which had replaced their souls), merging until only four remained. Three desired power and dominance, the last wanted freedom and independence.

The baleful trio emerged about 200 years ago, in the aftermath of the [[Cataclysm]], but kept their presence secret. They started to build a worship base among their creations, the [[ophidian]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the [[Jungle of Fangs]] as well as among others in the mountains to the north of the [[Great Rift]]. They also delt with [[Awakener]], channeling the energy from the planes themselves, granting them much more power than their relatively meagre, unenthusiastic worship base would suggest. This was destroyed, and their power substantially weakened, by [[Enigma]] in late 250 AC. The Rainbow Serpent operates in secret from [[Aaru]], although she has joined forces recently with the [[Queen Ascendant]] and come out of the shadows since the weakening of her arch-rivals (who sought to destroy her).

As gleaned from reports from North Ithemba (as close as any scholar of the Sages has ever been), the zandolit have the following characteristics:
* They're cold blooded, both physically and emotionally. They tend to think rationally or at least dispassionately. They sort-of understand emotions, but those don't have much influence over their actions, with a few exceptions.
* Tribe and territory means a lot to them. "Us" vs "outsider" is a major concept; the word for "threat" and "stranger" are strongly related. Tribes tend to be smallish, a few hundred at most (including children). Gender is relatively irrelevant. Tribes are lead by a warleader advised by a shaman.
* Most zandolit are content to deal with primitive technology (effectively stone age). Very few farm, although they are omnivorous. They tend to wander and/or live in crude huts.
* Zandolit tend to propitiate/placate the kami; they only worship gods (or other ascendants) as "I'll pay you, but you better help me." They're not considered very devout.
* Zandolit magic tends to the shamanistic (spirits, kami, and nature). 
* Zandolit are rarely subtle or deceptive. And strongly dislike those who are.

==Notable tribes==
;The [[Qu-Ti]] : An anomaly, living in a secreted valley under the protection of [[Gozh]], these zandolit are civilized and farm and have technology.

==Council Lands History==
During the [[Council Lands]] era, wall-builders did not choose their own occupations or those of their children. Many don't even choose their spouses or their places of residence. So who does? The Oracles of the Oracle's Circle, that's who.

Acting like the Human Resources department of the guild-centric Council system, the Oracles coordinate manpower and assign apprentices within crafts and guilds. Of all the organizations of the Council government, they are the smallest and most highly-regarded (at least by the traditionalists). Radicals claim that they have become corrupt and that the entire scheme is nothing more than a way to keep the rich and powerful in their lofty, comfortable seats at the expense of the lower classes. It is certainly true that in recent decades the Oracles have become a major political force despite being theoretically a-political. Many of the highest-ranked oracles live comfortable lives in their cloisters through donations from the powers that be. And strangely, the sons and daughters of the rich and powerful tend to get chosen for prestigious and safe apprenticeships in the heartlands, not sent to the frontier. That being said, most of the Oracles are dedicated men1 who take their oaths very seriously and work in what they believe to be the best interests of the people and the nation.

The bulk of the organization are the Eyes, those oracles who travel between villages carrying out the day-to-day choosings and resolving disputes where they arise. They walk a circuit of 10-20 villages, trying to get to each village every other month (less in the winter when travel is hard). Dressed in simple grey, hooded robes and plain brown half-masks, they carry simple staffs and satchels said to be magically sealed against intrusion. Much of their time is spent gathering information, which they transcribe and pass up the chain. Without this core, the decision-makers higher up the chain would not be able to keep the system running. In truth, there are many more sources of information than just the obvious ones--most of the tavern-keeps and priests report to the Eyes.

The Hands are the enforcement arm. Trained as monks, they handle those changes where resistance is expected or act as bodyguards for the other members. Their staffs are wrapped in red leather bands and their masks are black. They travel in teams of 4 or 8, some of which might be capable of casting spells.

In each of the larger towns (a total of 20 or so) are the Local Oracles--one per town. These are the practical training grounds for new oracles after they leave the Cloister--each of the Locals has 3-5 trainees to act as runners, apprentices, and general helpers. They supervise the Eyes and call for the Hands to be dispatched where needed. A given town might have one Local and a squad of Hands, plus whatever Eyes are passing through right then. If needed, they can call on the local Temple guards and town militia for help. A Local Oracle wears a grey robe trimmed in fox fur and carries a staff with metal-shod ends. Their masks are grey edged in white.

In each of the regional capitals ([[Baile Craan]], [[Rauviz]], [[Yuuras Zaali]], and [[Fuar Uulan]]) are stationed the Regional Circles in addition to the Locals, each composed of four senior oracles with their staff (mainly trainees). They are responsible for the affairs of the region as a whole and are the primary power-brokers of the regions. Of the four, Rauviz's Circle is the most prestigious, with Fuar Uulan's being the weakest (since few wall-builders live there and the dwarves mainly ignore the oracles). Members of the Regional Circles wear white robes and carry white-wrapped staves. Their masks are white.

In Kaelthia proper are the First Circle, the Cloister, and the Minds. Technically only first among equals, the First Circle is the de facto leadership of the entire organization. Being asked to fill a spot on that circle is being promoted to the highest levels. It is also intensely political and connected. They spend their days mostly dealing with the movers and shakers of the Council and live lavish lives. They dress like those of the Regional Circles, except that their robes are of the finest materials and their masks often are jeweled.

The Cloister is the training facility and heart of the Circle. Carved into the eastern wall of the canyon, it overlooks the rest of the city but is inaccessible. Only the Oracles and their avowed servants can enter--not even the Guildmasters are allowed in. No women are allowed within, under any circumstances.

The Minds are the analytical engine that makes the whole system work. Approximately fifty men (plus trainees), chosen from the brightest candidates, they live full-time in the Cloisters and churn through rolls of parchment. It is they who collate all the data and decide which town gets which of their requests and how many of each guild there must be. While the commoners believe that they do so with mystical powers, they mainly employ sophisticated records and statistical means. They have records of every registered child born for the last 150 years (since the founding of the Oracle's Circle) and statistics about each legitimate town and village.

The High Oracle is chosen by the First Circle as an honorary leadership position. He is the face of the Circle, but certainly not a real power. His pronouncements are carefully written and monitored by the First Circle, and he cannot take any action without their approval.

Starting in late 210 AC, a rumor has spread that some of the oracles are experiencing prophetic dreams--becoming oracles in truth. It seems that the [[Archon of Time]], Mother of Visions, has taken an interest in them as they call themselves Oracles but do not work by Her aid.

==Current (ca 250 AC) organization==
Much of the organizational structure remains, but the force is much reduced and the hierarchy is subordinate to the Temple. There are movements afoot to require them to accept women into their ranks, but they are the most conservative element and are very resistant to change.

      <text bytes="2623" sha1="f3k9pprpwoc8w5ogb7dc2a8ifbuvovq" xml:space="preserve">A cliff-side mausoleum and cemetery complex in the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] between the [[Abandoned Clans]], [[Tuura Adam]] and [[Zhapai Karmap]]. Used for ages to bury important dead. Dominated by the Great Mausoleum where a statue of a seated titan with a wyrm coiled around the throne oversaw the entire complex since the First Age. In reality, those "statues" were [[Perkunos]] and [[Tatsuryuu]], frozen in stasis by an ancient curse. The complex was the site of a major disturbance as [[Tzeru]], driven insane by loss of duty, tried to raise an army of stolen souls in 212 AC. This was ended by the [[Wild Cards]] and the two prisoners were freed. Since then, the site has been monitored by forces from each nation, seeking to prevent another such event.
[[File:Dead-halls-small.webp|thumb|Dead Halls, ca 250 AC]]
Buried here are the heroes and villains of countless civilizations; not just the [[jazuu]] and [[dwarves]]--there are aelvar, orcs, and humans in their number. The last burial here dates to the late 3rd age, near the time of the Cataclysm, when the [[Flower Kingdom]] buried the one known as Kinslayer in the outermost tier. All other information about this individual was erased--only the name and the bizarre standing coffin remain.

The area itself still feels the residue of both the age-old binding curse that imprisoned the two Ascendants as well as the aetheric devastation caused by the fallen archangel in her mad attempt to breach the veil between worlds and call the dead back to life. As a result, the mausoleum decays very slowly--there are still skeletons and corpses from the Second Age. However, the feelings of the dead and the mourners and burial parties are etched into the stone itself, like the blast shadows of people erased by a catastrophic detonation. They are not ''undead''--there is no [[Jotnar|jotnari]] influence. But in such a solemn, broken place, even echoes can take physical form...and these ghosts are not happy.

As a result, the duty to tend this place has fallen to the [[Tattered]] and their Hands. These souls, as broken as the echoes they comfort, are among the few that can walk unmolested...for the most part. The Hands deal with the corporeal ghosts who refuse comfort, although their destruction does not last. The only peace comes from the Tattered themselves, as they accept the pain of ages, taking on themselves the burdens of the dead. Many only want to have their names said one more time...but many of the names have been lost. Erased from history intentionally or by centuries of weathering.

These crazy dead folk have taken it upon themselves to fight back against the [[Waste]], taking up the role discarded by the ancient [[cysgoroesi]], but without most of their power. In this futile quest, most blightguard only survive a few years (instead of the ~100 that most of the dead manage) before being consumed by demons, sent beyond the [[Infinity Gate]], or driven utterly mad.

For all the blood and horror, they're also some of the most stable, well-meaning, ''chillest'' folk in [[Shadow]].

Fell in love with [[Archdruid Kantorell]], who served as the tree's guardian for decades before the war. After he was killed in that climactic battle, she preserved his body and drew inward, becoming hostile to all things and shifting from the Court of Autumn to the Court of Winter, becoming an icy being.

After his resurrection by the mercy of [[Melara]] and the choice of the [[Heroes of Pactum]], she and he founded the [[Pactum Grove]] and now administer that forest and druid circle. She still doesn't like most people or civilization, other than him of course.

      <text bytes="1570" sha1="g0mlg0hl5at7wa8ooxev2a25vabzswb" xml:space="preserve">Also known as the fishfolk, the god-makers, and "those annoying slimy folk", depending on location. One of the oldest people, these appear to be short (~4'-5' tall), purple-skinned (with slimy skin) humanoids with webbed feet and hands and fish-head-like faces featuring bulbous, wide-set eyes and pointy peg-like teeth. Despite their appearance, they are amphibious, although they require water to keep their skins moist and reproduce underwater (via laying clutches of eggs).

The ika-ika are one of the older races, dating back to sometime in the [[Ages of the World|2nd Age]]. Their origin is uncertain, but it is believed that [[Leviathan]] or its agents created them out of [[goblins]], hybridizing them with fish. They lack the shared-memory-space of the goblinfolk, and instead have an unnaturally-large ability to believe. Given enough concentrated belief, the thing believed in can become real, at least to some degree. This happens primarily with "gods", where a group of ika-ika find some shiny idol-object and venerate it, creating an astral reflection of that thing that then empowers them (as pact-bound). None of these are very strong, since most ika-ika are also relatively easily distracted to the new shiny. When faith collapses, so does the believed-in creation, at least if it doesn't have an external source of support.

It is believed that this trait was observed and used as the basis for the [[Ages of the World|Third Wish]], allowing the faith of other creatures to have a similar (if more muted but more permanent) effect.

      <text bytes="2363" sha1="q6x8q8ovpyqueg43fs8vjhkkl4qb74l" xml:space="preserve">A race of aquatic humanoids found throughout the seas of Quartus. Of all the children of [[Leviathan]], the kalasaa are the closest to surface-dwellers in shape and appearance. Ironically, they're also one of the less frequent of the sea-dwellers to interact with surfacers.

==Physical Appearance==
Visually, kalasaa are human, except with non-human skin and hair tones, usually blues and greens. Their feet and hands are slightly webbed, and some have small fins on their lower arms and legs. Their eyes tend to be deep green. They average slightly shorter than most humans, with both males and females standing around 5' tall, although with significant variation. Sexual dimorphism is similar to that of humans, although females are just as large as males (on average). Kalasaa are stockier and hardier than most humans, and are fully amphibious and capable of swimming and living in the depths.

==Cultures==
Many, if not most, kalasaa believe themselves to be the chosen servants of [[Leviathan]] and, in alliance with the other sea races, form war bands to hunt the servants of the [[Twisted]], especially [[mkhulu]] and [[comiedai]] who serve that demonic beast. They also consider themselves the keepers of the artifacts of civilizations lost under the sea. As a result, kalasaa society is martial, with strong emphasis on righteousness and order.

Most kalasaa settlements are in the deeper areas of the continental shelves, located hundreds of feet under the water, and they rarely approach the surface except on the hunt for thieves from their protected areas.

===Ikelan Kalasaa===
One exception to this are the kalasaa of [[Ikela]], a nation on the north-eastern coast of [[Soefra]]. Living in abnormally shallow waters (for kalasaa), the cities of [[Ikel'Mer]], [[Pel'Mer]], and [[Kal'Mer]] are shallow enough that the tops of the towers are exposed at low tide. They once were deeper until the [[Cataclysm]] reshaped the land. Adapting ably, they formed an alliance with the local human communities and ever since have conducted the business of a hybrid human/kalasaa kingdom. Unlike most kalasaa, they no longer worship [[Leviathan]]; instead they revere the Sea Mother, an aspect of [[Selesurala]] as well as a coterie of [[ascended heroes]], the [[Wave-minder]], the [[Walker of the Middle Path]], and the [[Eightfold Eye]].

Engaged to [[Tson]] Azur, with a wedding scheduled for the end of winter 250 AC. Not incredibly traditional for a halfling woman, she's fine with men's liberation. As long as [[Tson]] is hers and no one else touches.

== Personality ==
She's picked up a strong snarky side, especially having dealt with [[Enigma]] and [[Ahzekiel Cai'Valur]]. Hiding underneath that is a young woman who cares about the people she feels responsibility for and a strong sense of justice.

'''Bond''': [[Tson Azur]]. Secondary: [[Bradford]] and [[Hero's Rest]].

'''Ideal:''' Justice. All should be treated as they deserve...or a little better. Especially those who can't help themselves very well.

'''Flaw''': She doesn't fit incredibly well with the rest of halfling society because she struggles to keep her mouth shut when someone pushes her buttons.

      <text bytes="4196" sha1="mijj5hdndocr95czzdcmfcico0r16k5" xml:space="preserve">Some dragons become “changed” after the First Molt. These drakkons, as the “normal” dragons call them, lack some part of the draconic soul and do not progress through the usual age/molt cycle; instead they ''stagnate'', remaining in a perpetual adolescence of sorts. Drakkons are intelligent creatures, attuned to elements just like "proper" dragons, but two significant differences remain. First, they will never undergo the [[Dragons|Third Molt]] into proper adulthood. Their Second Molt is abbreviated, usually only a few days. The creature that emerges, although it is the size of a regular young dragon, is physiologically adult and capable of breeding. Second, drakkons never develop a proper sense of '''hoard'''. This means that they must draw their energy from the food that they eat; many dragons believe that this is the critical difference that prevents the proper Third Molt. This leaves drakkons feeling perpetually hungry, at least unless they can bond with a mortal partner (as described below).

==Frequency==
Roughly 1% of hatchlings become drakkons (of the total 70% that fail their First Molt), although there is substantial variation in this rate. Currently, the flights of northern [[Soefra]] are experiencing a large upswing in the number of "failed" First Molts that result in drakkon. This has been on the increase for the last 100 years or so, but with a substantial increase in the last 5 years. Drakkons now make up the majority of failed First Molts, and failures are up to 80% of all hatchings. Some of the elder dragons there believe that this is a curse or effect imposed by some hostile party; others believe it is a natural birth defect.

Children of drakkon parents are always drakkons themselves. These "born" drakkons keep the elemental attunement of their parents (with random choice between the two if the two were of different colors) and are wyrmling-sized once they come out of the egg. They never go through a First Molt.

==Relationships with regular dragons==
Throughout most of the world, drakkons are looked at as lesser. They are not counted as part of the flight and are generally driven out once their condition is known. Coupled with their driving hunger, most of the "rampaging dragons" throughout the world are actually drakkons, driven to desperation by the yawning void within.

With the substantial increase in drakkon population of [[Soefra]] has come a sort of societal acceptance within the flights there. A concerted effort to seek out bond-mates for the drakkons has led to the formation of organized [[dragon knight]] groups associated with each of the major flights. The drakkons of [[Soefra]] are desperate to prove themselves more than talking animals.

==Relationships with mortals==
Mortals rarely can tell the difference. To mortals, drakkons are [[dragons]]. And their hunger gives [[dragons]] a bad name.

==Physical Description==

Drakkons are distinguished by slightly blunted features and muddier colors. They are physically slower, clumsier, and more vulnerable than regular dragons; immature drakkons are incapable of sustained flight (hopping in bounding glides instead) and mature ones are much slower than the young dragons they resemble. 

==The Dragon Knight Bond==
The only known way for a drakkon to fill the void within is to bond to a mortal partner in a mystic ritual involving mingling their blood and souls. The mortal gains power; the drakkon shares his soul, filling the missing pieces. Effectively, the drakkon’s hoard is their partner. Bonded drakkons grow swiftly based on the growth of their partner. The bond means that they will age and die with their partner as well, although that lifespan is greatly extended should the pair gain enough strength. The two gain an empathic link. This connection has its drawbacks, however, and should the knight fall in battle, the dragon too will die, as the dragon's spirit can't live without the knight. Should the dragon fall in battle, the knight can restore its body with a costly ritual. This makes the mortal partner the "senior" companion in the bond in most cases, a humiliation that regular dragons find somewhat shameful.

      <text bytes="40084" sha1="r5dytlgtzhz7fizvxhqp3bkltfiuiid" xml:space="preserve">A human clad in gleaming plate armor stares down a snarling owlbear, slowly reaching for the lance strapped across her back. The owlbear charges before she can reach her weapon, but a gout of fire from the sky stops the owlbear in its tracks. The silver [[drakkon]] lands in front of the human, its eyes burning with a fiery vengeance as it snorts, causing flames to billow from its nostrils. Mounting her dragon, the human lets out a war cry as the [[drakkon]] takes off into the air.

Pulling the bowstring back, the elf whispers a few hushed words as an arcane fire erupts around the goblins below. Lightning sparks at the tip of his arrow, and he grins to himself as he fires at the goblin chief. The arrow finding its mark, the goblin chief can barely cry for help as lightning explodes from his body, arcing off to his nearby guards. In the trees, a nearby blue [[drakkon]] chuckles to itself as it descends upon those left. 

The [[drakkon]] sniffs at some rubble before nudging it, looking back towards a halfling. She comes over and together they shift the rocks. Reaching her hand out, the halfling brushes the hair out of the eyes of the small boy who lies in the rubble. A shield of divine magic wraps around his small frame as the halfling pulls him into her arms, carrying him to safety.  

Scowling to himself, the half-orc looks around the darkened cave for his quarry. Letting out a short whistle, a dark [[drakkon]], onyx in color, seems to appear from the shadows with a dead drow in its maw. Rolling his eyes, the half-orc makes a motion with his hands, and the [[drakkon]] spits out the drow, a sheepish expression on its reptilian face as darkness begins to swirl around the pair, causing them to vanish.  

While different in personality and fighting styles, all these heroes are dragon knights, a champion who fights alongside a [[drakkon]] companion. Tough, relentless, and unyielding, knights and their [[drakkon]] never give up, fighting to either heroic or devious ends.

===History===
Dragon knights are rare. Very few are the dragons who are willing to give up their independence and hoard-seeking and subordinate themselves to a short-lived mortal. In most cases throughout the history of Quartus, the bond has been the reverse—the dragon commands and the short-lived humanoid obeys, with a master-servant relationship.

Some dragons, however, become “stunted” or “changed” after the First Molt. These [[drakkons]], as the “normal” dragons call them, lack some part of the draconic soul and will never bond with a hoard or become a proper adult; instead they are governed by an intense, unquenchable hunger unless they bond with a mortal partner and share his soul. Effectively, the bonded [[drakkon]]’s hoard is their partner. This “stunting” has become most prevalent in Soefra in the last 100 years. Some of the elder dragons there believe that this is a curse or effect imposed by some hostile party; others believe it is a natural birth defect.

Drakkons are slower, clumsier, and more vulnerable than most, and do not progress through the age categories. Instead, they grow swiftly based on the growth of their partner. The bond means that they will age and die with their partner as well, although that lifespan is greatly extended should the pair gain enough strength.

===An Unbreakable Bond===
The bond between a knight and their dragon is nearly impossible to eclipse. Only powerful magic can even attempt to turn them against one another, and they nearly never fight each other against their own will. Despite this, a knight and their dragon are known to argue over strategy, tactics, or even miscellaneous things, as the dragon, despite its respect for its knight, is not quick to let go of its ego.  As the knight and dragon grow together, this bond strengthens, granting both the knight and dragon impressive strength and unique powers. The dragon is typically the stronger of the pair as they develop, but will be weaker earlier on, while the knight still has to watch over them to ensure their bond continues to flourish. Eventually, some knights might put down their weapons and live a simple life with their dragon, having forged a legendary friendship through the trials they faced. 

This connection has its drawbacks, however, and should the knight fall in battle, the dragon too will die, as the dragon's spirit can't live without the knight. Should the dragon fall in battle, the knight can restore its body with a costly ritual, but a few knights might instead choose to let their dragons rest and go on to simply channel their dragon's power instead.

===Practice Makes Perfect===
All dragon knights are divided by their practice, and much like the dragons they raise and fight with, the knights are known to be proud at their best, and egotistical at their worst. Two people of different practices are rarely able to get along, despite how similar they might be. Those of the Platinum Practice always regard themselves superior to those of the Shadow Practice, and members of the Elemental Practice consider the members of the Rider Practice to be brutish and dim-witted.  

Despite these rivalries, dragon knights are fiercely loyal, and will never betray another dragon knight, even if they come from a different practice. Dragon knights believe they only have each other to count on, as no one else understands the intense bond between the knight and the dragon.

===Creating a Dragon Knight===
When creating your dragon knight, there's one question you should consider before all others; how did you get your dragon? Was it a gift from an ancient dragon, looking for someone to protect its young, stunted though they might be? Did it declare you as its knight one day, much to your surprise? All dragon knights go through the bonding ceremony, which is where they form a close bond with their dragon, establishing each other as allies and protectors. Was your dragon willing in this ceremony, or was it raised to serve you? Or did your dragon actually perform the ceremony, and you had absolutely no clue as to what was going on?  

Something else you must consider is your character's martial abilities. All dragon knights are skilled in combat, and how your character gained that skill is something that will need to be considered. Perhaps they were a student at a military academy, or a guard-in-training at their hometown?

===Quick Build===
You can make a dragon knight quickly by following these suggestions. First, make either Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on the type of weapons you want to use. Your next highest ability score should be Constitution if you plan to focus on melee combat, or Charisma if you want to improve your overall subclass features.  Second, choose the Folk Hero background.

===Covenant===
Each dragon knight has a different story to tell when it comes to how they met their dragon. The way a dragon and knight first meet often set up how they interact for the rest of their lives, and a bad first impression can prove disastrous to their bond.  When you consider the creation of this covenant, also consider the following: were you and your dragon both willing, and does your character ever regret the bond?

'''d6 - Covenant'''
# Bonding with a dragon as you reach adulthood is all you've ever known and is the way your ancestors have always lived.
# You stumbled across your dragon in a forest, cave, or on the beach. Since then, it hasn't stopped following you around.  
# Your dragon has always been with you for as long as you remember, and you can't remember ever conducting a formal ritual.
# As a way of proving yourself, you went out into the wild to capture a dragon as proof of your strength and power.
# Forced to bond with your dragon, it acts as a guardian and a protector, despite how much you insist you don't need its help.
# Reroll

===Relationship===
The nature of the relationship between dragon and knight varies between each dragon knight and changes the way each knight and dragon interact with each other, and those around them.  This relationship is based on their covenant, ideals, flaws, and personality traits. While you decide on your relationship, consider how it will affect the way you and your dragon fight together.

'''d6 - Relationship'''
# Best friends can't even begin to describe you and your dragon, and you do absolutely everything together.
# Your dragon is merely a tool to be used, and you like to frequently remind it of such.
# Despite your differences and arguments, you and your dragon have come to respect each other, but your relationship is still rocky.
# You and your dragon have both agreed to keep your relationship businesslike. All that matters is how you can help each other.
# Much to your distaste, you actually serve your dragon, and it acts as the leader in your relationship.
# You and your dragon bitterly hate each other but are forced together because of the bond you share. You both understand separation could prove disastrous.
 
===Obstacles===
Having a draconic companion is not without its complications. Somewhere in your travels, you and your companion may have caused fear among travelers or gained the ire of a noble court. This obstacle might determine complications that arise in your adventures. Should you choose to roll or select from the following obstacles, or create your own, be sure to consider how it affects how you and your dragon interact with others. 

d4 - Obstacles
# Bounty hunters are looking for your dragon, as its scales and teeth could sell for quite a lot.
# A village believes that your dragon is the cause of all their problems and seeks retribution.
# Due to your bond, you have slightly draconic features that make you appear untrustworthy and intimidating.
# A religious order considers you a heretic for having a dragon companion and wants to "liberate" it for their own purposes.

===Class Features===
====Hit Points====
'''Hit Dice''': 1d10 per dragon knight level &lt;br&gt;
'''Hit Points at 1st Level''': 10 + your Constitution mod &lt;br&gt;
'''Hit Points at Higher Levels''': 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution mod per dragon knight level after 1st &lt;br&gt;

====Proficiencies====
'''Armor''': light and medium armor, shields&lt;br&gt;
'''Weapons''': Simple weapons, martial weapons&lt;br&gt;
'''Tools''': None&lt;br&gt;
'''Saving Throws''': Constitution, Charisma&lt;br&gt;
'''Skills''': Choose two from Arcana, Athletics, Deception, Intimidation, Perception and Persuasion.&lt;br&gt;

====Equipment==== 
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons &lt;br&gt;
(a) scale mail or (b) leather armor &lt;br&gt;
(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) five javelins &lt;br&gt;
(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack &lt;br&gt;

Alternatively, you may start with 5d4 × 10 gp to buy your own equipment.

====Multiclassing====
Members of this class cannot multiclass; the bonds between rider and dragon forbid it.

===Dragon Covenant===  
At 1st level, you form a covenant with a drakkon of a particular type. The term "dragon" in this document is intended to be drakkon. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later. You also gain the service of a dragon companion. The statistics for the companion are found at the end of this document. The dragon gains additional damage immunities and traits based the type of dragon you chose for your Dragon Covenant, as shown on the Dragon Type table at the end of this document. 

When you die, your dragon will also die after a number of hours equal to your dragon knight level.   If your dragon is ever slain, the bond you share allows you to return it to life.  By performing an 8-hour ritual and expending 50 GP worth of precious gems per your dragon knight level, you can call forth your dragon’s spirit and create a new body for it. You can return your dragon to life in this manner even if you do not possess any part of its body.  This is a grueling process.  You must expend a number of hit dice equal to half your dragon knight level (rounded up) to perform this ritual, and you gain one level of exhaustion until your next long rest.

===Bonus Language===
You can speak, read, and write Draconic due to the bond you and your dragon share.

===Companion's Bond===
At 1st level, your dragon gains a number of benefits because of the bond you have forged together. The dragon obeys your commands as best it can. Your dragon shares your initiative and acts on your turn. You determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on.  If a dragon knight is incapacitated, the dragon acts on its own. If the dragon knight is absent, the dragon rolls its own initiative. Your dragon can use its Claw action to attack but does so at disadvantage. It normally uses the Dodge, Help, Disengage, or Dash action in combat. The dragon has yet to master flying and falls if it ends its turn in the air.   The dragon can't be used as a mount, nor can it fly with a creature it has grappled.

Your dragon has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your dragon's level is equal to your dragon knight level for the purpose of calculating effects from spells like polymorph and true polymorph. Your dragon companion’s armor class is given by
: ''Armor class = 10 + its Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.''

Draconic abilities that require the target to make a saving throw have a DC given by
: ''Draconic ability DC = 8 + your Charisma modifier + your proficiency bonus''

For each dragon knight level after 1st, your dragon gains hit points equal to 5 + its Constitution modifier, and it gains one additional hit die. The dragon's hit dice are d8s, regardless of its size. When reduced to 0 hit points the dragon makes death saving throws as a player character would.  

Your dragon also gains proficiency in two additional skills of your choice and shares your saving throw proficiencies. Your dragon companion can't attune to or activate magical items. You and your dragon always know the direction to one another, and can communicate with vague images, emotions, and feelings regardless of distance to one another while you are on the same plane.  

Whenever you gain the Ability Score Improvement class feature, your dragon's abilities also improve. Your dragon can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or it can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, your dragon can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Your dragon companion can't take feats.  

Your dragon shares your alignment and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your dragon shares your Ideal; its Bond is always "I will protect my knight; I will do the best I can for my knight; I will die for my knight." 

'''d4 - Trait'''
# I love to collect gems and art pieces.  
# If you threaten my friends, you threaten me.
# I stay on alert so others can rest.  
# I love to explore, so that I can discover and learn about different cultures.

'''d4 - Flaw'''
# As a dragon, I'm naturally superior to others.
# I'm secretly terrified of other dragons.
# I hold permanent grudge against anyone who offends my knight.
# I get jealous when my knight spends time with people other than me.

===Dragon's Fury===
At 2nd level, your dragon companion is ready for battle, and can use the Claw action normally as well as grappling and shoving.  Additionally, your dragon gains the following attack options, which you can command it to use as a bonus action on your turn. If the dragon can make more than one attack on a turn, it can replace one of its attacks with the chosen option. Your dragon is proficient with these attacks and adds its Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls with them. Your dragon can use any of these attack options a number of times equal to its Strength modifier (minimum of once.) It regains any expended uses when it finishes a long rest.
:'''Bite Attack''' Your dragon makes a melee weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage, and an extra 1d6 damage. This extra damage increases to 2d6 at 6th level, 3d6 at 10th level, and 4d6 at 14th level. The additional damage is the same type as the one associated with your Draconic Covenant. 
:'''Tail Attack''' The dragon makes a melee weapon attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The reach of this attack increases to 10ft at 6th level, 15ft at 10th level, and 20ft at 14th level.
:'''Wing Attack''' Your dragon beats its wings.  Creatures of your choice within 5 feet of your dragon must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 5 feet away from the dragon. The range of the push and distance a creature is pushed on a failed save increase by 5 feet at 6th level, 10th level, and 14th level. Immediately after making this special attack, your dragon can move up to half its flying speed. 

===Dragon Knight Practice===
At 3rd level, you can choose a Practice that defines your combat style, either Rider, Elemental, Luminous, or Shadow. These practices are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.

===Eye for Detail===
At 3rd level, you can easily discern the value and rarity of gems, art pieces, and magical items. You can spend 1 minute studying a gem or art piece, after which you learn its exact value. If it is a gemstone, you learn what kind of gemstone it is. If it's an art piece, you learn how old it is.  You can cast the identify spell, but only as a ritual.  You don't require material components for the spell when you cast it this way.  

===Ability Score Improvement===
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. 

===Coordinated Assault===
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. At 11th level, when you miss a weapon attack on your turn, your dragon can use their reaction to make a single claw attack.

===Draconic Growth===
At 5th level your dragon companion's flying speed increases by 15 feet; its other speeds increase by 10 feet, and it no longer falls to the ground if it ends its turn in the air. At 9th level its flying speed and other speeds increase by a further 15 feet and 10 feet respectively.

===Breath Weapon===
Starting at 6th level, as an action on its turn your dragon can unleash raw, destructive elements from its mouth. The shape of the breath weapon is determined by the color of your dragon, as shown on the Dragon Types table. Each creature in the area takes 4d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The area of the line or cone and the damage of the breath weapon increase as you gain levels in this class, as shown below. Once your dragon has used this ability, it can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

{| class="wikitable"

|}

===Draconic Advancement===
At 9th level, your dragon has matured, allowing you to fight together more fluidly. Your dragon’s size is now Large, it can be used as a mount, and it is able to fly with a creature it has grappled. Additionally, the damage of your dragon's bite, claw, and tail attacks increases to 2d6.

===Draconic Nature===
At 11th level, you take on the physical aspects of a dragon. You gain resistance to the damage type associated with your Draconic Covenant, and you gain one of the following benefits:
  
:'''Scales'''. Scales cover sections of your body, helping shield you from harm. While you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Charisma modifier. You can still wield a shield and get this benefit.
:'''Eyes'''. Your eyes become sharp and focused. You gain proficiency in the Perception and Investigation skills, and you have advantage on any (Wisdom) Perception or (Intelligence) Investigation checks based on sight.
:'''Persona'''. You gain proficiency in the Intimidation and Persuasion skills, and you have advantage on all Charisma (Intimidation) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks.

===Titanic Roar===
Starting at 13th level, your dragon can let loose a vicious roar as an action on its turn, filling nearby creatures with dread. Any number of creatures of your choice within 20 feet of the dragon must make a Wisdom saving throw against the dragon's breath weapon DC. On a failed save, creatures are frightened of the dragon for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.    Once your dragon has used this ability, it can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

===Legacy of the Dragon===
At 14th level, you have been blessed with a dragon's extended lifespan. You age only one year for every ten years that pass, and you can't be aged magically.
 
===Ancient Resistance===
At 17th level, you can shrug off even the most dangerous effects. Whenever you or your dragon fail a saving throw, you can choose to turn that failure into a success. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. 

===Fulfilled Covenant===
At 20th level, you and your dragon share hit points, the total of which is equal to your hit point maximum + your dragon’s hit point maximum. Whenever one of you takes damage, that damage is subtracted from your combined hit point maximum.  When this hit point maximum hits 0, both you and your dragon fall unconscious, but only you make death saving throws. If you become stable or die, so does your dragon. If you receive any healing, both you and your dragon return to consciousness.  When you spend hit dice during a short rest, you can use both your hit dice and your dragon’s hit dice to restore hit points.

==Dragon Knight Practice==
All dragon knights can call themselves members of the Rider Practice, Elemental Practice, Platinum Practice, or Shadow Practice. The Rider Practice focuses on working in sync with their dragon: both in and out of the heat of combat. The Elemental Practice heightens their battle skill with magic, unleashing destruction on their foes. The Luminous Practice channels radiant energy to defend home, allies, and the flight. The Shadow Practice uses misdirection and guile to gain the upper hand in all situations.

=== Lessons Learned After Playtest 1 ===
Too much emphasis on the dragon, not enough on the rider. Rider feels like an auto-attack bot, but dragon's abilities aren't generally strong enough to carry interest.

===Rider Practice===
The bond between a dragon knight and their dragon is strong, but those of the Rider Practice take that even further. They seek to live and to die beside their dragon, a sentiment shared by the dragon itself. While not all riders mount their dragons, those who don't are rare. Those of the Rider Practice fight in tandem with their dragon and win in tandem with them. 

===Dragon's Claw===
Starting at 3rd level, you're able to better co-ordinate with your dragon. While both you and your dragon are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls that don't target you or your dragon, and if the hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to attempt to grapple or shove the creature rather than attack it with a weapon.

===Fighting Style===
At 3rd level, you adopt a style of fighting. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a fighting style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
: '''Archery''' You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.  
: '''Dueling''' When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
: '''Great Weapon Fighting''' When you roll a 1 or a 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

===Dragon's Shelter=== 
Starting at 7th level, if your dragon is within 5 feet of you, it can protect you from a creature it can see as an action. Until the start of the dragon's next turn, the creature's attack rolls against you have disadvantage. If your dragon isn't within 5 feet of you at any point during the duration, the effect ends.

===Dragon's Wing===
Starting at 10th level, you and your dragon rule the sky.  Mounting and dismounting your dragon only costs 5 feet of movement instead of half your speed, you have advantage on saving throws made to avoid falling off your dragon, and neither you or your dragon take fall damage if you fall 20 feet or less.

===Dragon's Rampage===
Starting at 15th level, your dragon can use an action to rampage and make a claw attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of it, with a separate attack roll for each target. If you're within 5 feet of your dragon when they rampage, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against one creature within your reach that was attacked by your dragon during their rampage. Your dragon can't rampage again until you finish a short or long rest.

===Dragon's Presence===
Starting at 18th level, the range of Titanic Roar is increased to 120 feet and creatures that are frightened of your dragon have a speed of 0. Attacks made by either you or your dragon against creatures frightened of you by this feature have advantage.

==Elemental Practice==
Dragon knights of the Elemental Practice value the raw, destructive power of their dragons, as well as their inherent charisma, and strive to both emulate and empower this aspect of their dragons through magic.

===Spellcasting===
When you reach 3rd level, you heighten your battle ferocity with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 of the Player's Handbook for the sorcerer spell list.  

'''Cantrips'''. You learn two cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. You learn an additional sorcerer cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

'''Spell Slots'''. The Elemental Practice Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spells level or higher. You regain all expended slots when you finish a long rest.    For example, if you know the first level spell chromatic orb and have a 1st-level and 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast chromatic orb using either slot.

'''Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher'''. You know two 1st level sorcerer spells of your choice. Both must be from the enchantment or evocation school spells on the sorcerer spell list.    
    
The Spells Known column of the Elemental Spellcasting table shows when you can learn more sorcerer spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or evocation spell of your choice and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the sorcerer spells you know with another spell of your choice from the sorcerer spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must also be an evocation or enchantment spell.

'''Spellcasting Ability'''. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells because your magic draws from the power and dominance of dragons. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
: ''Spell Save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier''
: ''Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier''

===Elemental Weaponry===
Starting at 3rd level when you hit with a weapon attack, you can spend a spell slot to deal extra damage to the target. When you do so, the target takes 1d6 damage of the type dictated by your Dragon Covenant for each spell level of the slot spent, up to a maximum of 5d6.

===Dragon Rush===
At 7th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, if your dragon companion can see you, it can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

===Elemental Fury===
At 10th level, when you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die of the type associated with your Draconic Covenant, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

===Destructive Reach===
At 15th level, your elemental prowess extends outward. When you make an attack with an imbued weapon and hit, you can have up to two creatures within 10 feet of the target of the attack take half as much additional damage. 

===Annihilating Breath===
At 18th level, when your dragon uses its Breath Weapon, you can empower it. Empowered Breath Weapons deal maximum damage instead of rolling the damage dice. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

==Luminous Practice==
A few dragon knights revere the sun, life, and light. The members of the Luminous Practice are dedicated to protecting their allies, flights, nests, and families. Religious practitioners dominantly serve [[Tor Elan]]. Luminous practitioners often, but not always, are bonded to gold dragons.

===Bonus Proficiency===
Starting when you choose this practice at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

===Fighting Style===
Starting when you chose this practice at 3rd level, you adopt a style of fighting. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a fighting style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.
: '''Defense''' You gain +1 to your armor class while you are wearing armor.  
: '''Dueling''' When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
: '''Great Weapon Fighting''' When you roll a 1 or a 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. 

===Luminous Protector===
At 3rd level you can glow with luminous power. As a bonus action on your turn, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet for 1 minute. Whenever you or another creature takes damage while in an area of bright light you shed, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by an amount equal to 1d6 + half your dragon knight level. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

===Sun’s Shield===
Beginning at 7th level, you now shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet when you use your Luminous Protector feature.  When you reach 15th level, each radius of the light increases to 30 feet.  

===Indomitable Dawn===
Beginning at 10th level, you're able to easily stand against the tide of battle. You and your dragon have advantage on ability checks and saving throws to avoid being knocked prone, grappled, restrained, or otherwise moved against your will. 

===Golden Corona===
Starting at 15th level, when you reduce the damage a creature would take to 0 with your Luminous Protector feature, you can cause that creature to gain a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma modifier. These temporary hit points last for 1 minute.

Additionally, the light given off by your Sun’s Shield feature becomes sunlight.

===Astral Aegis===
At 18th level you and your dragon companion gain resistance to necrotic damage, and to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. When you use your Luminous Protector feature, all allies within the radius of the Sun’s Shield also receive this resistance.

==Shadow Practice==
Dragon knights who associate strongly with the dragon’s origin as servants of Darkness make up members of the Shadow Practice. Dark and elusive, these dragon knights use misdirection and guile to gain the upper hand in battle. Shadow practitioners often bond with black dragons, but not always.

===Creeping Shadows===
Starting when you choose this Practice at 3rd level, you can move effortlessly across the battlefield, blending in with the shadows. You have a number of uses of this feature equal to your Charisma modifier and regain all uses when you finish a long rest. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend a use of it to conjure a 10-foot radius sphere at a point you can see within 30 feet of you, which becomes lightly obscured with wisps of dark energy. This sphere lasts for 1 minute, and any bright light inside the sphere becomes dim light. While inside this sphere, you and your dragon can each spend 5 feet of movement to teleport to any unoccupied space also inside a sphere. You and your dragon can each only teleport this way once per turn.   

When you summon this sphere, you can expend additional uses of this feature. Each additional use expended increases the radius of the sphere by an additional 10 feet.  You can't have more than one sphere conjured this way at a time. If you summon a second sphere using this feature, the first sphere vanishes. If you move further than 120 feet from the sphere, it vanishes.

===Withering Breath===
Beginning at 7th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your dragon's Breath Weapon feature, it begins to wither for 1 minute. Withering creatures make all weapon attacks at disadvantage. Withering creatures can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. 

===Night Walker===
At 10th level, you and your dragon can take the Hide action as a bonus action while in dim light or in darkness. You and your dragon also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks you make to hide in dim light and darkness. 

===Shifting Shadows===
Starting at 15th level, you can have up to two spheres conjured by your Creeping Shadows feature at once. If you summon a 3rd sphere, a sphere of your choice vanishes. 

===Umbra Pulse===
At 18th level, your dragon can create a vortex of swirling darkness around itself as an action on your turn. Creatures of your choice within 30 feet of your dragon must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, creatures take 10d10 necrotic damage and you can choose to have them either pulled up to 15 feet towards you or pushed up to 15 feet directly away from you. On a successful saving throw, creatures take half as much damage and aren't moved. Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

      <text bytes="6546" sha1="cbreq7pho48yj0y817t98w2fc92wak1" xml:space="preserve">The [[cysgoroesi]], or shadow elves (despite not really being elves), are governed by a Council of Septarchs, who make decisions affecting all the septs (which are a cross between sub-cultures, political parties, and organizational structures to which all cysgor belong).

==Ranks==
Cysgor who are associated with the monasteries (and thus first-class citizens) are part of a hierarchy. Septarchs and abbots speak for septs, but many septs may share a monastery. Which means that the Abbot and the Priors may not be allies.

; Septarch : Technically first among equals of the abbots of a given sept. In the council, the septarchs exercise a veto on any policy that would directly affect their sept. This veto can be overridden by a vote of 12 of the remaining members of the council. They do not preside over a monastery personally.
; Abbot : monastery heads, at least technically. A few of them have roles that go beyond any particular monastery. There are currently 11 abbots for 9 monasteries.
; Prior : Heads of specific efforts within a monastery.
; Sub-prior : lieutenants to the prior.
; Hierophant : team leader for the larger teams.
; Servitor : Lowest rank, serving on a team.

==Political Parties==
Update as of 16 Slumbers 250 AC -- after a tumultuous Conclave session, major changes have occurred. None of the three parties remain intact, and things are still unstable. With the return of the [[Cysgor Regalia]] and the [[Ebony Rod]] and [[Soul's Stillness]], Cysgor society is in upheaval.

Pre-tumult politics:

The primary division among the [[cysgor]] other than sept is how they answer the question "how must our way of life change to prevent the Great Decline" (the impending extinction of the cysgor race). There are three major factions--

; The Expansionists: This group, headed by Septarch [[Jael of Myji]], believes that the answer is to reinvigorate the race through selective breeding and conquer new lands and bring others under the cysgor umbrella. Policies include the Realignment (bringing all females out of teams and assigning them to chosen males) and establishing new creches. They would throw away many of the traditions and bring the race into a more "progressive" and "modern" age. With them at the head, of course. 
; The Traditionalists: This group, headed by Septarch [[Balaam of Oula]], believes that the answer lies in re-establishing the traditional place of the cysgor people as the defenders of [[Shadow]]. They are searching for ways to re-establish the [[Pact with Death]], although their understanding of that pact is limited.
; The Renunciates: The smallest group, headed by Septarch [[Bilbah of Deverel]], wants to retreat from [[Shadow]] as much as possible and focus on building the race in more conventional ways. They see [[Shadow]] as poison.

==Profiles of Abbots==
Update as of 16 Slumbers 250 AC -- Jael, Elias, Pagiel and Zadok are fled and/or dead. Ahira stands as confirmed Septarch of Myji; Libari is (reluctantly) Septarch of Bran Vras, and [[Selai]] (a previously lower-ranked Oula) has stepped into the role of Septarch of the Oula.

===Myji (Ravens)===
* Septarch [[Jael of Myji]]. An imperious, driven man. Wields the top segment of the [[Ebony Rod]] as a symbol of his authority. Known for being intensely persuasive, almost in a mesmerizing way. The public face of the Expansionists.
* Abbot-Myfryr Elias of Myji. Abbot of Myfryr. Pudgy and oily, he's the one who is pushing the Realignment the most. A complete snake, but quite intelligent.
* Abbot Pagiel of Myji. Abbot of a Myfryr satellite monastery. Replaced Abbot [[Arnyek]] after his exile. A young cysgor man, he is a total syncophant of Jael's, rumored to never have an independent thought.
* Abbot-Deadlands Ahira of Myji. The eldest of the Myji abbots, he's out of favor with Jael's faction. Focused mostly on the war against the Waste. Ally of Abbot Ashur of Orsa and a staunch Traditionalist.

===Bran Vras (Magpies)===
* Septarch [[Zadok of Bran Vras]]. An expert arcanist, he's an expert in the artifacts of the ancient cysgor. Wields the center piece of the [[Ebony Rod]]. Jael's shadow and (some believe) the power behind the throne.
* Abbot Libari of Bran Vras. Abbot of one of the satellite monasteries of Fortress Cysga. Libari focuses on the reclamation efforts, trying to retrieve artifacts. Dislikes outsiders. A loyal soldier to Septarch Zadok.
* Abbot-Cysga Kohath of Bran Vras. Abbot of Cysga. Apolitical, he focuses only on crafting and maintaining the shadesteel golems.
* Abbot Mahli of Bran Vras. Abbot rank, but not head of a monastery. He is the head of Bran Vras's intelligence operation. Close ally of Abbot Enon of Orsa. Officially neutral, he's not part of Bran Vras's inner circle.
===Orsa (Bears)===
* Septarch [[Mahlon of Orsa]]. Fairly new to the post, which he gained in part by Jael's machinations. Very indebted to Jael and publicly an Expansionist, but not particularly happy with that.
* Abbot Ashur of Orsa. Vice-abbot of Deadlands. Extremely traditional, has little patience for politics. Head of the guard force and very military-focused.
* Abbot Enon of Orsa. Head of a satellite monastery of Myrfyr. Head of Orsa's intelligence and assassin network. Highly opposed to the Realignment, in part because many of his best agents are women. Politically officially neutral, although his sympathies lie with the proscribed organizations that try to resurrect the Lost Septs.
===Oula (Owls)===
* Abbot [[Balaam of Oula]]. Head of the traditionalists. Ancient. Arch-traditionalist, he was [[Arnyek]]'s secret patron until the latter's insanity was exposed too much.
* Abbot-Brightpool Zuriel of Oula. Head of Brightpool Fortress. Mystic and head of the Listener teams. Supports the Realignment based on "dreams and visions and omens", but only weakly connected to the Expansionist party.
* Abbot Merari of Oula. Head of a satellite monastery of Myfryr, where the archives are kept. A historian and archivist, he rarely speaks. He is one of the few who knows the truth about the Lost Septs.
===Deverel (Beavers)===
* Septarch [[Bilbah of Deverel]]. Head of the Renunciates and the only woman on the Council. A hard, bitter woman who is deeply unpopular with her fellows. Currently maintaining a veto on the Realignment against attempts to override it.
* Abbot Achan of Deverel. Not head of any monastery, but associated with Fortress Deadlands. At odds with his septarch; he supports the Realignment despite being officially a Renunciate.

I never knew I’d see a Crystal Arbor&lt;br&gt;
I always knew adventuring brought harm&lt;br&gt;
I only wanted to stop the Jester’s intrigue&lt;br&gt;
I didn’t want to see the &lt;br&gt;
Insides of a purple worm&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Purple worm, purple worm&lt;br&gt;
Acid burnt me, squeezing harm&lt;br&gt;
Purple worm, purple worm&lt;br&gt;
Took all I had to stop&lt;br&gt;
Digestion by a purple worm&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Never saw the flash of halfling’s smiting&lt;br&gt;
Nor saw Zeke defended by his magic stave &lt;br&gt;
Didn’t see Rune bleed and run to save me &lt;br&gt;
From becoming worm turds &lt;br&gt;
On the floor of a deep cave&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Purple worm, Purple worm&lt;br&gt;
Arcane transfer brought free-dom&lt;br&gt;
Purple Worm, Purple Worm&lt;br&gt;
Keep me dry and safe,&lt;br&gt;
Outside of a purple worm&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Gleaner's blade, behemoth banished&lt;br&gt;
Warlock sent Rune far from home&lt;br&gt;
Tortured by that baby shark song&lt;br&gt;
Returned to make fresh chutney&lt;br&gt;
 Of that purple worm.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Purple worm, purple worm&lt;br&gt;
Warlock’s minion, maw of doom&lt;br&gt;
Purple Worm, purple worm&lt;br&gt;
The tunnel terror slain by &lt;br&gt;
Enigma’s might of arms&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{cittern solo with lute rhythm}
&lt;br&gt;
Purple worm, Purple worm&lt;br&gt;
Jester foiled, Warlock doomed&lt;br&gt; 
Purple Worm, Purple Worm&lt;br&gt;
Keep me dry and safe,&lt;br&gt;
Outside of a purple worm&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
If you have trouble with a ri-tu-al&lt;br&gt;
The Jester’s gotta a plot&lt;br&gt;
You want it fixed fast, but you don’t know how&lt;br&gt;
Summon the team that’s hot&lt;br&gt;
Just let us know&lt;br&gt;
We’re good to go&lt;br&gt;
Cast sending any time&lt;br&gt;
Ask for Zeke and Tsun and Rune and Dil&lt;br&gt;
Results will be sublime&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Daring deeds, don’t come cheap&lt;br&gt;
Daring deed, don’t’ come cheap&lt;br&gt;
Daring deeds, don’t come cheap&lt;br&gt;
Daring deeds but we don’t come cheap&lt;br&gt;
{minor riff, and right into the next verse}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You got a problem in a dungeon deep&lt;br&gt;
Your temple’s broke apart&lt;br&gt;
Your song corrupted by a twisted fiend&lt;br&gt;
A mountain's rotten heart&lt;br&gt;
Send out the call, Enigma’s hall&lt;br&gt;
We’ll get the word, no fear&lt;br&gt;
Tell us your woes, adrenalin flows,&lt;br&gt;
We’ll stick ‘em with our spear &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Daring deeds, don’t come cheap&lt;br&gt;
Daring deed, don’t’ come cheap&lt;br&gt;
Daring deeds, don’t come cheap&lt;br&gt;
Daring deeds but we don’t come cheap&lt;br&gt;
{minor riff again, and go for the big finish}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You got a problem and you want it gone&lt;br&gt;
But you ain't got the guts&lt;br&gt;
Trouble and strife for you all night and day&lt;br&gt; 
Enough to drive ya nuts&lt;br&gt;
You gotta choice, we  hear your voice,&lt;br&gt;
We surely feel your pain,&lt;br&gt;
For a small fee, we’re glad to be&lt;br&gt;
Yer problem's doom and bane &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Daring deeds, don’t come cheap&lt;br&gt;
Daring deed, don’t’ come cheap&lt;br&gt;
Daring deeds, don’t come cheap&lt;br&gt;
Daring deeds but we don’t come cheap&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
{repeat until fade, audience participation&lt;br&gt;
We say “Daring Deeds” and point to audience&lt;br&gt;
They yell “Don’t Come Cheap!”}&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div style="font-size:92%; line-height: 2.1em;"&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the year 139, the Brinemaiden left the quay &lt;br&gt;
In the days when crops had failed&lt;br&gt;
The fair ship sailed out &lt;br&gt;
Into the blue and sunny morn &lt;br&gt;
The sweetest sight ever seen&lt;br&gt;
Then they journeyed night and day&lt;br&gt;
So the story tellers say&lt;br&gt;
And the score brave souls aboard&lt;br&gt; 
For many a lonely day sailed across the astral  seas&lt;br&gt;
Ne'er looked back, full of hope, never cried &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Don't you hear my call&lt;br&gt; 
Through the astral paths I stray&lt;br&gt;
Don't you hear me calling you&lt;br&gt;
Did the slavers bind your hand&lt;br&gt;
Empty huts perched on the sand &lt;br&gt;
In the land our grandkids never knew&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the year 239 came a ship into the quay&lt;br&gt;
The Brinemaiden fair brimmed with news&lt;br&gt;
Tidings they brought home of a fair and fertile shore&lt;br&gt; 
Though their hearts sank like stone, from the truth&lt;br&gt;
Empty hearth, abandoned quay&lt;br&gt;
All their kin were gone away &lt;br&gt;
They’re Fuhino refugees &lt;br&gt;
Oh, so many years have gone &lt;br&gt;
I am older but a year&lt;br&gt;
Your mother's eyes, from your eyes, cry to me&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Don't you hear my call&lt;br&gt;
Through the astral paths I stray&lt;br&gt; 
Don't you hear me calling you&lt;br&gt;
Did the slavers bind your hand&lt;br&gt;
Empty huts perched on the sand &lt;br&gt;
In the land our grandkids never knew&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
Don't you hear my call&lt;br&gt;
Through the astral paths I stray&lt;br&gt; 
Don't you hear me calling you&lt;br&gt;
Hourglass reverse your sand &lt;br&gt;
Let me sail time’s backward span&lt;br&gt;
Where my love, in between, waits for me&lt;br&gt;
{Strum to finish}&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Tribute/Parody to ''Seagull'' by Bad Company.&lt;blockquote&gt;

Erai, you fly across the horizon&lt;br&gt;
Into the misty morning sun&lt;br&gt;
Nobody asks you where you are going,&lt;br&gt;
Nobody knows where you're from&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There is a poet asking the question&lt;br&gt;
Is this really the end of the world?&lt;br&gt;
Erai, you must have known for a long time&lt;br&gt;
The shape of things to come&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now you fly, through the sky, never asking why,&lt;br&gt;
And you fly all around &lt;br&gt;
till the demon of the spirits, &lt;br&gt;
shoots you down&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Erai, you fly, across the horizon,&lt;br&gt;
Into the misty morning sun.&lt;br&gt;
Nobody asks you why you are drinking &lt;br&gt;
No one  begrudges your rum &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now you fly through the sky, never asking why,&lt;br&gt;
And you fly all around &lt;br&gt;
till the demon rum with it's curse&lt;br&gt;
Shoots you down.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ooooooooh, Erai&lt;br&gt;
My heart lifts when you fly&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And you fly away today&lt;br&gt;
And you fly away tomorrow&lt;br&gt;
As you fly and take my heart&lt;br&gt;
Leave me to my sorrow.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then you fly, on high&lt;br&gt;
Inspire my faith in light&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then you fly, so high&lt;br&gt;
Send all the darkness to night! &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Fly away today&lt;br&gt;
Fly away tomorrow,&lt;br&gt; 
Fly, it makes me cry&lt;br&gt;
leaves me full of sorrow, &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Fly.. {hold the word}&lt;br&gt;
Erai {hold the word}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{Slow picking in a major key}&lt;br&gt;
{End and the light goes out}&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tidal waves out on the sea&lt;br&gt;
Sulfur smoke up in the sky&lt;br&gt;
Pretty soon we learn to fly&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Let me hear ya now I don't know&lt;br&gt;
I don't know&lt;br&gt;
I don't know where I'm a gonna go&lt;br&gt;
When the volcano blow&lt;br&gt;
Now my man quickly say to me&lt;br&gt;
Baby you better watch your feet&lt;br&gt;
Lava come down soft and hot&lt;br&gt;
You better lava me now or lava me not&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Let me say now I don't know&lt;br&gt;
I don't know&lt;br&gt;
I don't know where I'm a gonna go&lt;br&gt;

Where I go I hope there's rum&lt;br&gt;
Not to worry, we’ll soon come&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now I don't know I don't know&lt;br&gt;
I don't know where I'm a gonna go&lt;br&gt;

But I don't want to land in Toryuu City &lt;br&gt;
Don't want to land in Godsfall town&lt;br&gt;
Don't want to land on Ins'dal Island&lt;br&gt;
Don’t wanna hit the hard cold ground&lt;br&gt;
Don't want to land in southern Soefra &lt;br&gt;
Or in the plains, they so dusty&lt;br&gt;
Don't want to land in the Eastern desert&lt;br&gt;
Wanna go home, to see Ma Husty&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I don't know I don't know&lt;br&gt;
I don't know where I'm a gonna go&lt;br&gt;
When the volcano blow&lt;br&gt;
Just a one more, I don't know&lt;br&gt;

# First are the Renunciates, loners who don't join organizations. They bonded with their [[drakkon]] on their own and have not met other dragon knights or have refused to join the Free Brotherhoods or the Flightbound, or possibly have been exiled from those groups. Free from the strictures and boundaries, they are able to pursue their own goals, while also acting alone. The Free Brothers are most accepting of the Renunciates, while the Flightbound tend to view them with suspicion.
# The Free Brotherhoods are small groups (usually 2 or 3 knights) who have pledged to support one another. Brotherhoods pledge to aid other Brothers, to uphold honor, to seek out and train new knights, and to protect mortals from the ravages of unbonded [[drakkon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and their hunger. In general, they take the side of mortals. The Free Brothers tend toward the Rider and Shadow practices. Mercenary knights are either Renunciates or Free Brothers. There is a loose central clearing house in (city), where a retired knight turned merchant maintains connections with the wandering Brothers.
# The Flightbound are those knights who have pledged their loyalty to one of the dragon flights. Their code of honor and practice depends on the flight; they pledge ''obedience'' more than anything. The word of the ancient is absolute. In conflict between flight and mortals, they take the side of the flights without hesitation. Flightbound tend to either the Luminous practice or the Elemental practice, although there are Flightbound of every practice.

Successor to the [[Dark Lady]], chosen because he was the only link to the last non-forceful, non-brutish ruler of that area. Born in 143 AC as the fourth son of the junior branch of the then-ruling line, the Sat'psas. The last real Sat'psa was overthrown in 165 AC by an opportunistic bandit lord named [[Il'ka]], who was then slaughtered and overthrown by the [[Dark Lady]] in 2000, who ruled until deposed and killed by the [[Catalysts]] in 206. Balin spent much of the intervening years as an adventurer and mercenary on many frontiers. During this time, he swore blood oath to two others--the [[ophidian]] shaman Coral Fang and the hulking silent barbarian Urgok. They swore that they would be brothers and that should any of them die, the others would adopt their children. And children they had (both legitimate and illegitimate). Both the other two died before his ascension; in keeping with his oath he adopted their children. The latter 15 years before the fall of the [[Dark Lady]] were spent in [[Asai'ka]], where he had 4 wives and a large number of concubines, mistresses, and lovers. His total descendents number in the hundreds and his blood (by marriage or descent) is mingled with most of the noble houses of [[Asai'ka]] and the [[Serpent Dominion]] to this day.

His reign was notable because he spent most of it incapacitated, but did not declare an heir. This led to a succession crisis, in which [[Hvang Srey]] emerged victorious. In this contest, the candidates were required to attain support from all three of the castes--noble, lai, and common. There were a dozen contestants at the start; many withdrew quickly. Only a few were actually killed before the Queen's Fang stepped in and made it clear that any funny business would see him pick the winner, and it wouldn't be any of them. At the end, there were four viable contestants.

== Notable Offspring ==

* [[Sat'psa Dara]], one of his elder legitimate children (by his 1st wife), owned and ran the [[Ironstrike Mines]] in the northern part of the district for many years. He and his father were never on great terms, especially since Dara made his peace with the oppressor lord and lady. Dara was one of the contestants in the succession crisis, but his candidacy was hampered by the fact that he had gained the severe dislike of both commoners and merchant castes. He died in 226 AC of natural causes.
* Sat'psa Po, a legitimate child of his 3rd wife, was a total non-entity who was married off to [[Hvang Srey]] (and she was adopted into the family) to settle some debts. After her ascension, he pottered on before dying of an infection caused by an untended scratch from a rosebush in 245 AC. They had four children.
* [[Sat'psa Leng]], an illegitimate son of a common mistress. Raised with the Sat'psas as a adjutant to the legitimate sons, he quickly learned to schmooze and earned himself the position of Phra of an outlying city. His quixotic candidacy was bankrolled by the [[Red Lantern Society]], a devil-worshiping cult. He also invited in the [[Ship Folk]], whose beach-head is now the city of [[Tarad'am]]. When his duplicity was discovered, he raised the [[Devil's Rebellion]], at the end of which he was executed for treason.
* [[Sat'psa Vanna]], his last child by his fourth wife (said to have [[Ophidian|ophdian]] blood, although that's not confirmed), was an arcanist and alchemist who ran a set of clinics and produced beauty products. Beloved of the common folk but rejected by the nobles, she became entangled with the [[Awakener]] presence at the [[Temple of the Moon]] in her attempt to gain the throne. She was the mother of [[Azhtar Cai'Valur]] and the lover of [[Torvald'vel'Orobas]] before his fall. After being freed from [[Awakener]] possession by the [[Dimwit Syndicate]], she suffered mental trauma and regressed to the mental age of a teenager, never regaining her full faculties. She died about in about 245 AC of natural causes, mostly in consequence of her trauma.

Their primary area of interest was in and around [[Meas'sraat]], where they suborned (through bribery) the local Phra and began a breeding program, attempting to breed a true half-devil and/or host for Gethry himself. This was foiled during the [[Devil's Rebellion]] in 212 AC, and most of the leadership were killed (either in the battles or executed afterward). The rest scattered throughout the [[Serpent Dominion]] and [[Asai'ka]], where they continue plotting.

Currently ruled by [[Pelas the White]], formerly of the [[Dimwit Syndicate]]. He received the title of Phra for his participation in the events around the [[Battle of Kel'al'ar]] and the other actions of the Syndicate. Under his leadership, the town has become a significant trading mecca for goods coming from [[Tarad'am]] and [[Tong Pa]]. Not incredibly political.

Roughly the same size as [[Kard]], Tabar eschewed the manufacturing and farming life for that of warfare against the [[Hungering Frost]]. In the long decades of peace since its fall, Tabar has generally involved itself with the [[Wyrmhold Politics|War Party]], but their numbers and leadership is split between the sub-factions.

They're still considered first among equals, but they've suffered significantly from the Clanless movement. They're also one of the more civilized tribes, and the least traditionalistic and least inclined to the shamanistic ways.

This failed because the [[Watcher]] will not accept [[Gleaner|gleaners]] who are beholden to other organizations.

== Features ==

=== Escape the Moment ===
Starting when you choose this tradition at level 2, you gain the ability to force yourself slightly out of sync with the local time stream. As a reaction when you would fail a saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, you can make an Intelligence saving throw against the same DC. The result of this Intelligence saving throw replaces the failed saving throw, potentially turning the failure into a success. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses after a long rest. You can gain additional uses by expending a spell slot of 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; level or higher as part of the reaction used to trigger the feature.

=== Past is Present ===
Starting at 6th level, you can bring visions of the past into the present day. After touching a location or creature for 1 minute, state an event or a time period within that location or creature's history you would like to view. If the target is a creature, it can make a Charisma saving throw against your spellcasting DC. On a success, your attempt to see its past fails and the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the target is a location, make an Intelligence (History) check against a DC of 10 + 1 for every 50 years that have passed since that event or time period. A failed check means that you cannot attempt to see the same event or time period again until 24 hours have passed.

If you succeed at seeing the past, the requested event or time period overlays itself over present reality and plays out. You can choose to play it forward at normal or double speed, pause it, or rewind it (back to the starting time), and the vision lasts for 10 minutes of real time. You cannot interact with anything in the event, but you can see or hear anything you would normally be able to see or hear from the location you were standing when you activated the feature and you can walk around the scene, passing through creatures and objects as if they were not there. If the target was a creature, the point of view is limited to the creature's perceptions. Once you successfully use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

=== Group Escape ===
Starting at 10th level, you can use your Escape the Moment feature when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you meets the trigger conditions. When you do so, make the saving throw as if you were the one targeted and apply the result to the affected creature. If more than one creature within range would benefit, it applies to all of them. Only make one saving throw and apply it to all affected creatures.

=== Echoing Spell ===
Starting at 14th level, you can cause a spell you cast to re-occur at lower strength. When a spell of 5th level or lower you cast ends, you can use your reaction to cause it to echo as if it had just been cast. None of the echoed spell's parameters (targets, spell level, or any choices made when casting the spell initially) change, but new saving throws and attack rolls must be made. If the spell dealt damage, it deals half as much damage and any saving throws against it are made at advantage. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short rest.

It was the primary spoken and written language across all of the post-war states except the [[Fanged Kingdom]], who retained their own dialect. To this day, it is the dominant spoken and written language of [[Federated Nations]] and is understood at least as a second language by virtually all the civilized peoples. It is written in the Imperial script.

==== Real Life "relative" ====
Common is represented by English, especially for naming conventions.

==== Related Languages ====
The language spoken in [[Jinse Empire]] and throughout much of the Eastern side of the continent is of the same language family, about as related as English and German are in the real world (although the sounds are very different).

      <text bytes="1584" sha1="rxbuy3b6vdiiinx92pvm5twlfpmn0og" xml:space="preserve">The written and spoken language of [[Tibor Imperia]], now considered a dead language. Originally called Imperial Standard. Standardized at the start of the reign of the Biblia dynasty (about 1275 BC), it has an older variant (Early Imperial) that dates back to the beginning of the [[Ages of the World|Third Age]].

== Script and Alphabet ==
The (revised) script for Old Imperial is designed for easy learning and is entirely phonetic. Each of the 32 letters has a unique sound (independent of location within a word) designed to represent all "legal" phonemes. Foreign words that use "illegal" phonemes are transformed until all sounds are representable by morphemes consisting of one consonant and one vowel per syllable.

== Current Uses ==
Although no populations use Old Imperial as their native tongue, Old Imperial is still a significant language in written form among the educated and governing classes of the [[Federated Nations]]. Much of the scholarship that comes out of the various sage bodies and schools is written in Old Imperial (although more has recently been published in other tongues, including Common) and many of the seminal works of philosophy, magic, and natural studies are only published in Old Imperial. In addition, many of the ruins of pre-cataclysm structures have significant records or writing in Old Imperial.

== Language Family ==
Imperial Standard and Early Imperial are the founding languages of the Imperial language family, which includes languages such as [[Common]].

== Real Life Analogue ==
Latin

Extremely slow to change, written Tumni records from millennia ago are still nearly perfectly understandable by modern speakers.

Tumni is quite verbose with an emphasis on precision of description.

Tumni uses the [[Runic script]], an alphabetic (but highly non-phonetic) script.

== History ==
Jael was born in 35 BC to a Beaver mother who had never been into [[Shadow]]. He grew up lower class, but was selected to join the Ravens by winning a debate with a renowned Raven Speaker (one of the ravens responsible for persuading the dying to take up residence in soul gems) at age 15. He quickly rose to prominence, becoming Abbot of a satellite monastery near Myrfyr at age 29 and then anointed Septarch ten (subjective) years later (in 168 AC) after the previous Septarch passed. While there were rumors that the old Septarch died untimely, these quickly died away.

Since then, he has lived in [[Shadow]] at Myrfyr monastery and masterminded both his sept and the larger Expansionist cause.

== Politics ==
Jael is head of the [[Cysgor Politics|Expansionist]] faction of cysgor politics. He favors abandoning the traditions of the past and reforging the people into a new, stronger, aggressive race by whatever means necessary. He believes that the survival of the cysgor people is the only priority and will take any means and pay any price to see that come to fruition...as long as he remains at the head. Although he strongly prefers if ''other'' people pay the price.

Deals with Jael always have costs and hidden traps, and he plays the double game (one face in public and one face in private) very well. Pinning him down is very difficult. Coupled with his mesmerizing manner, he believes he can talk his way out of anything. Or into anything.

== Family ==
Jael has no spouse, but he has fathered several children on various women. He shows no sentimental attachment to either his lovers or his children.

== Appearance ==
A slim, well-kept man, Jael shows no signs of his age. His primary notable feature is his goatee (unusual for a cysgor, who rarely grow facial hair).

== Capabilities ==
Jael relies on three major capabilities--

* He wields the top section of the [[Ebony Rod]], although he is loath to actually display its power beyond the basics.
* His main weapon is his voice, which is a finely-tuned instrument capable of persuading stones and causing even his most bitter enemies to pause and consider.
* Despite this, he is still a competent swordsman and wields Blackedge, a magical rapier that drains the life from his foes.

An aging cysgor, he is known for his arcane power and his knowledge of ancient artifacts.

== Appearance ==
A wizened, almost skeletal man, Zadok is not pleasant to look on. Large splotches of discolored skin cover his face and hands; he mostly keeps himself covered by a hooded robe. When he walks, it's with a limp and one shoulder is higher than the other. It's said that his physical state is payment for his intense magical power.

== Capabilities ==
Zadok is an archmage-class arcanist, specializing in divination. Beyond that, he wields the center piece of the [[Ebony Rod]], and unlike [[Jael of Myji|Jael]] is more than willing to employ its powers. Zadok goes nowhere without an escort of elite Shadesteel Guardians.

== Politics ==
Zadok is an open [[Cysgor Politics|Expansionist]], but says very little in council meetings. He prefers to work in the shadows and through others.

An arch traditionalist and foe of [[Jael of Myji]] and [[Zadok of Bran Vras]], he supported [[Arnyek]]'s experiments until the depth of his insanity was revealed and the mad abbot was exiled.

== Politics ==
Balaam believes that the only way to prevent the Great Decline is to hold to the traditions even more firmly and reforge the [[Pact with Death]]. It must be noted, however, that his idea of the pact is not exactly the same as the [[Watcher]]'s idea. He believes that the Pact was that the [[Cysgor]] would be masters of [[Shadow]], taking the burden from the [[Watcher]] entirely (although not supplanting that being's role as Guardian of the Gates, however). He also firmly rejects the portion of the pact where the Owls would report to [[Leviathan]]...or at least would if he knew about it. He is intensely nationalistic and fairly xenophobic, believing that the [[Cysgor]] should have as little to do with other peoples as possible. Those of other races are tools to be used and discarded, although he doesn't believe in the cysgor dominating other races or mistreating them. Just wants them to separate out and have no contact (contamination, as he says).

== Capabilities ==
Unknown.

== Appearance ==
Old, wizened, but still in good health. His notable feature is his nose, which appears much too large for his face. He is good-natured about it, however. Despite his reputation, he is fairly jovial and pleasant to be around.

The head of the Renunciates, she would withdraw from Shadow entirely, abandoning the monasteries.

== Politics ==
As the founder and head of the Renunciates, she believes that [[Shadow]] is causing the decline in fertility and the malaise that is dragging her people down. And for good reason--it is. She doesn't believe in the "silly stories" of the [[Pact with Death]]--she blames demonic forces for the steeper decline after the "supposed" breach of that "supposed" pact. She believes that the old traditions are what are destroying her people, and she wants to break with the past entirely. She has a hatred of the Shadesteel Guardian program, considering them demonic in origin and anchors tying her people to toxic shadow.

It is whispered that she wants to do away with the Septs entirely and reform the people along different lines.

== Capabilities ==
Unknown, but she has survived many challenges and assassination attempts. It is known that she's an unarmed combatant of significant power.

== Appearance ==
Bilbah could have been attractive (or rather ''striking'') with her bright sapphire eyes and symmetrical form, but her hardness and intensity make that...difficult. Her jaw is always firmly set as if she's chewing on rocks. One of the younger septarchs, she's only (subjectively) in her 30s and is chronologically the youngest, since she spends so little time in [[Shadow]].

== Politics ==
Mahlon, to all appearances, is a staunch [[Cysgor Politics|Expansionist]] like his patron, Jael. However, his actual beliefs are otherwise. He strongly opposes (in private and as much as possible in public) the Realignment, knowing it would cost him his best agents (and likely his wife's love). His is a voice of caution in council, supporting the Expansionist cause but urging double and triple checks before acting.

== Family ==
From a low-ranking family, he climbed by hitching his star to Jael's. He married one of Jael's daughters (Sarai), although for love rather than politics. Sarai and her father...do not get along (to put it lightly). They have three children (an oddity among the Cysgor).

== Capabilities ==
Mahlon is a very capable melee combatant and general. In combat he prefers to wield a glaive reputed to be able to cut through anything.

      <text bytes="2763" sha1="0eux8r9v0fcr6n9ek8wvhvri2n6llh3" xml:space="preserve">An artifact harp, created by [[Leviathan]] and containing a fragment of that being's own soul. Given to the [[Cysgoroesi]] as part of the [[Pact with Death]], and then lost at the fall of [[Lyo Duo]]. Recovered by [[Enigma]] from [[Glorious Waters]], where it had been used as a brainwashing tool by the God-Kraken [[Sings-Songs-of-Glory]].

== Physical Description ==
As an artifact, the harp is capable of altering its size and shape, although it usually presents as a medium-sized lyre, with frame of ivory and shell. The strings are gut, but never need tuning. The ivory comes from a narwhal's tusk; the shell from a dragon turtle, and the strings from the gut of a great whale--[[Leviathan]] itself gave the pieces.

When it's feeling formal, it transforms into a large concert harp, and the decorations become encrusted with gems (especially pearl).

== Capabilities ==
The harp has many properties, although its true power is still shrouded in mystery.

* Voice of All : The wielder of the harp can create the sounds of any number of instruments, even instruments that have never existed and voices, simply by thinking--although it prefers to be played, the actual playing doesn't matter for the sound.
* Empowered Focus : A bard who attunes to the harp gains +1 to the saving throw DC of all their spells and can use it as a casting focus.
* Cooperative Caster : While attuned to the harp, the wielder can cast the following spells. Each spell can be cast once per day without expending a slot, but they count as bard spells known for the caster. If they require concentration, the harp concentrates on them when cast using the free use.
** Calm emotions
** Suggestion
** Mass suggestion
** Synaptic Static
** Legend Lore
** Tongues
** True resurrection
** Zone of truth
* Extra cantrip: While attuned to the harp, the wielder can cast the ''toll the dead'' cantrip as a bard spell.
* Sensitive: While attuned to the harp, the wielder is under the effects of ''detect thoughts''. Using the probe deeper option does not end this effect, but it cannot be used on the same target again for 1 minute.

== Personality ==
On the surface, Soul's Stillness is a perky, happy, peace-loving creature. She presents as female.

Due to her imprisonment and misuse at the hand of the [[Mkhulu]] in [[Glorious Waters]], she has developed a strong rebellious streak--she dislikes being ordered around or those who bark orders. She ''hates'' slavery and forced labor and will not attune to anyone who supports those.

Ideal: Freedom and peace

Bond: I was created by [[Leviathan]] for the [[Cysgor]] and want to protect them.

=== Militant Protectors ===
The Sun Shields are a militant order. Priests and acolytes of the order are expected to be trained in weapons and armor, preferring heavier armor and martial weapons, specifically the sword (or hammer) and shield. In the communities of the faithful, they serve as militia commanders and trainers. Generally, there is a strong expectation that the faithful in those villages will turn out for militia drill once every week, training in marching, formation fighting, and general physical fitness.

Not all Sun Shields are priests, although all are dedicated. The Sun Shields maintain secular (but closely-tied) smithies and transport networks.

=== Organization ===
The Sun Shields are commanded by a High Priest, who takes the name "the Fist of the Sun". He is also the commanding officer for the military of the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]]. Other ranks use military names: General, Commander, Knight-Commander, and Lieutenant, with Sergeant, Quartermaster and Private being the "enlisted" (ie lay) ranks.

They wielded [[Soul's Stillness]] via foul coercive magics to mentally enslave both local folk and sailors passing by, converting them into either mind-burned white-necks, mentally-caged red-necks, or zealots. Here they experimented to create automatic worship engines, cloned individuals who could fuel an [[Ascendant]] with worship without having independent thoughts.

This city was raided by [[Enigma]], who destroyed their primary temple tower, destroyed the control network, and then killed the kraken and recovered the harp. As of late 250 AC, it remains in an unstable state with zealot and some of the remaining [[mkhulu]] claiming portions of the city and freed red-necks and recovering white-necks claiming the rest.

== Location ==
Located at the tip of the [[Blood-thirst Wildlands]], a location known as Siren's Bay, in a natural bay that makes for a very good harbor. The area is considered to be taboo ("death water") by the [[Ship Folk]].

== Major Cities &amp; Geography ==
[[File:Ikela Political.jpg|right|frameless|800x800px|Ikela Cities, ca 250 AC]]
Ikela has twin capitals: [[Ikela City]] and [[Ikel'Mer]].

Other major cities (in descending order of size):

* [[Mirzapur]]: one of the oldest human settlements in [[Soefra]].
* [[Varanasi]]: Port city and cosmopolitan rival to Mirzapur.
* [[Rewa]]
* [[Jhansi]]: Major grain area.
* [[Calabar]]: Gateway to the [[Moonshell Treaty Lands]], known for being friendly to dragons.
**[[Pasona]]: small village near the north border.
* [[Bayannur]]: [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] clanhold, allied but not assimilated.
* [[Sheopur]]: Gateway to the unclaimed lands to the south.
* [[Surat]]: Newest of the major cities, fighting for recognition.
* [[Jaora]]: Considered somewhat cursed by the memory of the ancient evil dragon [[Kozhun]], who made his lair nearby.

== History ==
See [[Ikela History]] for the full overview. Main events

* Founded ~1100 years ago when [[Noefra|Noefran]] settlers landed near present-day [[Mirzapur]].
* Contact with the north was lost during the [[War of Souls]], leading to decay of civilization
* ~600 years ago, Kingdom of Mirzapur was founded.
* ~100 years later, the Dragon Tyrant [[Kozhun]] arrived and conquered
* After 350 years of slavery (about 150 years ago), [[Kozhun]] was defeated and destroyed.
* King Ikel I, in conjunction with [[kalasaa]] forces from [[Ikel'Mer]], founded the modern Ikelan state in 135 AC.
* [[Ship Folk]] of the Southern Expeditionary Fleet arrive, conquer northern cities in 229 AC
* In 235 AC, the Treaty of Kal'Mer is signed, ending the war with the [[Ship Folk]]
* In 247 AC, a mysterious event called the [[Reweaving]] alters memories and histories. Written records now state multiple contradictory ideas. Reports of strange creatures, places, and peoples grow, especially outside the borders.

== Neighbors ==

* To the NW lie the [[Moonshell Treaty Lands]], the domain of the [[Moonshell Flight]] of dragons, and traditional allies of Ikela, although that relationship has weakened in recent years.
* NE, dominating the north side of the Bay of Homecoming (name needs work) is the Southern Expeditionary Fleet and the conquered cities of (name), (name), and (name).
* Directly east is the nation of [[Merais]], a reclusive state with one underwater city of Merais (home to [[kalasaa]] and [[mkhulu]]) and one surface port city, [[Fatehpur]], home to a mix of people. One of the few nations in the region friendly to the arcane arts.
* To the south are the expansive [[Ikelan Colony Lands|Colony Lands]], where a mix of freeholding villagers, large sharecropped plantations, native tribes, and treasure seekers hold sway.
* SW of [[Surat]] lie the lands of the [[Nightmare Scar]], a particularly unfriendly and tenacious group. Oddly, these are a mix of human and [[zandolit]] tribes, both of whom claim to be the original holders of that name, yet both cooperating.
* Further into the mountains to the east is [[Clan Sunud]], another dwarven clan.

== Government ==
Ikela is an nominally-monarchic oligarchy, with the surface controlled by the 8 First Families (said to be descendants of the heroes that defeated [[Kozhun]]). The Royal Family, headed by King Ikel XIV, rules from the Coral Throne in [[Ikela City]] and officially rules over the surrounding area. Each of the other major cities other than [[Bayannur]] is the home of one of the First Families, who take their name from the city. Generally, the First Families are the major landowners for their seat of power and the surrounding villages, making their money off of rent. Several, especially those of Surat, Sheopur, and Jhansi, have significant investments in the Colonies. Together with the four Sea Families (their counterparts under the waves), they decide policy for the nation with the king acting as first among equals.

The branch families and assorted nobles, including life-title holders, make up the Second Families, of which there are many. They own and operate much of the lands outside the major cities, paying tribute and fealty to the First Family of the region.

While the Families have much power, they do not hold the criminal judicial power. That is allocated to the Judges, who are chosen out from the people (a mix of commoners and nobles) and form a separate class. Judges cannot own property, but are almost inviolate and their decisions can only be appealed to the full council of the First Families.

=== Titles ===

* Majaraja -- head of the Royal Family, occupant of the Coral Throne. Addressed as "Most Serene Highness".
* Raja -- head of any of the other First Families, rulers of the major cities. Addressed as "Highness".
* Prince/Princess -- members of the First Families. Addressed as "Your Grace".
* Rao -- Head of one of the Second Families or life-title holder in their own name. Addressed as "Your Excellency."
* Lord -- Members of the Second Families or spouse of a life-title holder. Addressed as "Sir" or "Madam".

== Economy ==
Ikela is mostly self-sufficient (lacking many neighbors to trade with), although trade with the dwarven communities and with [[Merais]] is fairly strong. Fishing in the bay and in the rivers, agriculture (the main staple grain is rice) are the dominant occupations for commoners. Exotic goods such as spices, dyes, and silks are produced primarily in the south and in the Colonies; metal goods flow from the mountains to the east and west. Some trade happens with the [[Ship Folk]], although that's less common.

Commoners either have free-hold on small pieces of land (much more common toward the fringes of the nation) or are sharecroppers and renters on the big plats of land owned by the Families. Even free-holders have to pay taxes (usually in-kind) to the local nobility, as well as provide labor for road maintenance and militia duties. Slavery is outlawed and commoners do have rights of appeal even against nobles. Generally, taxes are held fairly low, although some exceptions exist.

== Society and Culture ==
Ikela is a stratified society, with the First Families at the head, followed by the Second Families, the great merchant houses, the independent crafters, and then the common folk. Below them are the "tribals" from outside the lands or from the Colonies. While the nobility is relatively race conscious (with humans ~ kalasaa &gt; dwarves &gt; dragon-touched ~ sher'ka &gt;&gt; zandolit), that prejudice wanes quickly as you go down the social ladder. Gender is fairly egalitarian. Inheritance does not use primogeniture; land, in particular, is held in common by the entire Family, overseen by the head of the family (who is chosen differently in each family). For the First Families, the family proper only includes the current head, his or her siblings, and his children. Nephews and nieces of the head, born after a head is chosen in a generation, take their non-Family parent's family name. Those born while the previous head is still alive have their names formally changed on handover. This makes genealogy...interesting.

Education is widespread, with most people (outside the tribes) able to read and write Ikelan, which is a relative of [[Old Imperial]] (like [[Common]]), although heavily influenced by the native tongues and with substantial drift from the northern languages. It is written in the same alphabet as [[Old Imperial]]. Several major schools and universities exist, with [[Mirzapor]] and [[Varanasi]] having the largest and most notable. The [[Royal University of Mirzapor]] is considered more prestigious and exclusive, as well as more hidebound, catering to the Families, while the [[Sea-Sky School]] of [[Varanasi]] is more accepting of outside ideas. It operates in conjunction with the [[Sea-Song Academy]], the school mentioned below.

Fashion: See [[Ikelan Fashion]]

=== Attitude toward magic ===
Ikela is mildly suspicious of arcane magic, especially ''wizardry''. Sorcerers of more elemental or divine bloodlines are less suspicious. Dragon-blooded sorcerers are most common in [[Calabar]]. Divine magics are relatively common, especially in the older lands near the bay but mostly low power. As you move away from the bay, more primal magics become more common, as do elemental powers. Harmonic magic is relatively common throughout, with a famous school founded by a notable bard in [[Varanasi]], catering both to harmonic magic users as well as the weird and different of every variety.

=== Religion ===
''Main Page: [[Ikelan Religion]]''

Ikelan religion is a mix of worship of the [[Congregation]] (especially [[Selesurala]] in her aspect as Ruler of Oceans) and veneration of [[kami]] and minor [[ascended heroes]]. There is no state religion, although priests and priestesses are generally drawn from the Second Families, while ranking priests of any major city are generally part of the local First Family by blood or adoption. In addition, the Listeners are a conservative organization of [[kami]]-servants and primal practitioners spread throughout the land. They generally "speak for the land" and push back against expansion and development.

= Earliest Records =
The dawn of the human population in Soefra started, as far as our records hold, nearly 1100 years ago. As all the learned know, humanity is not native to Soefra; we hail from the fabled northern continent of [[Noefra]]. Our ancestors landed near what is now our beloved city of Mirzapur, colonists and settlers, and spread out across the Great Rift. We alone, however, have not stained our skins; we retain the lighter coloration of true humans.

Roughly 100 years after the First Landing, contact was lost with our ancestors’ homeland, plunging humanity into a dark age at the hands (or rather claws) of brutish beast-men. Our allies the [[kalasaa]] had not yet arrived, so humanity fell into barbarism, a state which persists across the [[Great Rift]] till this day, our own glorious nation excepted[1]. That state of decay, both moral and social, persisted even here for four hundred years.

== The First Kingdom ==
In 698 BCE, Lady Poliandra (of whom I am a distant descendant[2]), first of her line, founded the Kingdom of Mirzapor not far from where we sit. Her enlightened reign spread throughout most of the basin, subjugating the beasts and making allies with the Moonshell dragons and the kalaasa of Kal’Mer, who had arrived a few generations before. Within two generations, the power of Mirzapor had spread across the entire bay, including what is now Fatehpur and the Ship Folk lands to the north. But the peace was not to last. Her grandson, Indria the Fool, doomed our ancestors to 350 years of slavery and subjugation.

== Rise of the Evil Dragon ==
Indria was, as his appellation suggests, a fool. Weak and vacillating, he relied on advisors. He let the army and navy go to rot, preferring to build idle palaces and consort with his lissome beast-folk concubines[3]. At the advice of his short-sighted advisors, he forsook the treaties with the Moonshell and the kalaasa as “too expensive” and “unneeded in these times of peace”.

Into this era of rot and dissolution came the great wyrm[4] known as [[Kozhun]], his green wings, acrid breath, and conniving mind and agile tongue. He gathered a force of other dragons, as well as disaffected humans and barbarous beast tribes, and led them against the people of Mirzapor. Had Indria not let the army rot, there could have been a contest; had he maintained the alliances, Kozhun’s forces might have been defeated. But the army, led by fat Indria himself, took the field...and were utterly routed. Over the next 10 years, Kozhun consolidated his control over the entire area. Notably, he mostly left the Moonshell and the [[kalasaa]] alone for now; the first in keeping with the [[Dragons|Law of the Flight]], the conquest of the second was a venture for a later day.

== Reign of the Evil Dragon ==
Kozhun made his capital in the middle of Jaoshepar[5] at the ill-featured swamp capital now known as Dragon’s End. He and his fellow dragons (and their Riders) levied taxes on all the people, destroying them with flame and claw if they dared refuse. He took their children as slaves and (horror of horrors) put [[zandolit]] beast-folk in positions of authority over humans. Only the Moonshell flight held out--within a decade he had consolidated his hold over the entire Kingdom and beyond. While he never conquered the undersea holds, he laid tribute on them, including extorting slaves.

This reign lasted unbroken for 350 years; the only disruption was the [[Cataclysm|Upheaval]]. But since his power was not based in magic spells but in might and lies, even that change did not unseat him. It did, however, pave the way for his downfall.

== The Fall of the Dragon ==
Thirty-eight years ago [3 BCE, 97 AC], a band of heroes gathered here, in Mirzapur[6]. Eight in number (the number of holiness), they began to seek out ways to defeat the Evil Dragon and bring peace and independence to the land. Forced to flee at the hands of the Dragon Knight Fizbar, satrap ruler of the province for her evil master, they sought refuge among the dragons of the Moonshell flight. There, they learned of the Dread Dragon’s weakness--his hoard of souls, trapped in glass baubles which gave him power and allowed him to command his fellow dragons. But how to gain access to such a guarded place?

At this, the effects of the Upheaval become relevant. Among other things, it weakened the Moonshell, which led Kozhun to believe that he could overwhelm them and claim their lands and their souls. His initial attack killed many of their followers, but the dragons themselves escaped. And now, Kozhun had broken the Law and the Moonshell were free to oppose him directly. They, coordinating with the kalaasa and even the free mkhulu of Merais, launched a three-pronged invasion of Kozhun’s territory while the heroes stoked the fires of rebellion throughout the land. The proud Kozhun, thinking this the true threat, split his armies to crush them in detail before they could unify, going himself to the northern front against the Moonshell. But unification was never the goal, diversion was.

The heroes, taking advantage of Kozhun’s absence (along with the bulk of his forces), crept into Dragon’s End. There, in a cataclysmic battle that destroyed the place and cost all the heroes their lives, they managed to destroy the hoard of stolen souls. With Kozhun weakened and his Dragon Knights in disarray as mount and rider warred with each other for dominance, the allied forces rallied.

In the end, the great wyrm Belozhai, ancient of the Moonshell, and Kozhun met in conflict in the skies. For days[7] they battled, tearing great chunks from the other. And then, finally, Belozhai gave her last breath to drive Kozhun to the ground and pin him there under her bulk, where the two-legged allies hacked the evil beast to death. Thus ended the reign of the tyrant Kozhun.

== Rebuilding ==
With the former royal house destroyed centuries before, a new order was required. The Moonshell retreated to their lairs, grieving the loss of Belozhai, but not before a new treaty was made. Fearing the rise of another tyrant, the [[kalasaa]] king Qual’ikel gathered the remains of the human population to him. From them, they chose a brother of the leader of the band of heroes to be the new king, King Ikel the First. From the new joint capitals of Ikela and Ikel’Mer, the two races would rebuild. This Crowning Day, 35 years ago today, marked the first day of the Current Era. Ikel the First has now gone to the Storm Queen’s rest (may his rest be peaceful!) and his son, Ikel the Second, now occupies the Coral Throne in his place. Long live King Ikel!

This is the end of the lecture, but additional details about the history since then have been appended.

== Major events since 35 CE. ==

# 25 CE (125 AC) The Golden Age of [[Ikela]] begins
# 48 CE (148 AC) The Golden Age of Ikela ends with the death of Ikel the Second.
# 112 CE (212 AC) Colonization begins outside the southern border.
# Expansion continues until 128 CE (229 AC), when the invading Ship Folk of the Second Expeditionary Fleet drive the kalaasa and humans out of the north side of the bay.
# 85 CE (235 AC) The Treaty of Kal’Mer is signed, stabilizing the borders with the Ship Folk.
# 96 CE (247 AC) The [[Reweaving]][8] muddles much of the history.

== Footnotes ==

# Which conveniently ignores all the other civilized nations of the Great Rift.
# He wishes--the modern Polandris family took that name to make the completely ahistorical claim.
# This is not attested anywhere else and is likely the lecturer imposing his own bigoted opinions
# By modern reckoning, an ancient dragon
# The “island” formed by the splitting of the Ind into the Jao and the Sheo.
# Well....not really. Every major city claims to have been the birthplace of the heroes, and some claim that there weren’t any such thing. The records are...not clear. And it’s not clear why they’re not clear--it’s as if they all saw different things.
# Artistic license here...
# No one knows what this was, other than that it was the source of much of the mixed up historical records. Something caused a disruption. Some theorize that it was a breakdown of causality and time itself.

      <text bytes="5548" sha1="4so1mybgnpkppuzkr2ohx73stftb826" xml:space="preserve">One of the major cities of [[Ikela]], located where the Ind river splits into the Jao and the Sheo before flowing into the bay.
[[File:Surat poi.png|alt=Surat City|thumb|Surat with points of interest]]

== Population ==
Roughly 18,000. 80% human (and -touched), 10% [[zandolit]], and 10% other.

== Economy ==
Much of Surat's wealth comes from trade with the colonies. Heavier goods are floated down the Ind and either shipped overland or sent in barges down the Jao or Sheo. In return significant goods flow upriver to the river-side colonies. Some trade with the [[Nightmare Scar]] tribal group to the south-west.

Surat is relatively poor and subsists on agriculture. The wealth is concentrated in the families (that of Sura itself and the Jalshea Trading company that monopolizes the local colony trade, owned by the Ajagar family). Strong inequality is present. The profits from the trade mostly flow to the noble families and onward into the main part of the country, with little filtering down to the common folk. The nobles prefer hiring "cultured" servants from the bigger cities, leaving locals to mainly be sharecroppers and free farmers. There is a small middle class of skilled tradesfolk, but the area is dependent on goods coming up-river from the manufactories to the east and north.

== History ==
Founded on the site of a much older city that was founded during [[Ikela History|Ikela's golden age]] but mostly abandoned after the coming of the Dragon Tyrant, modern Surat is about 45 years old. A mix of ancient buildings, remodeled after the city was re-settled, and new-style buildings (in a mix of styles). The increased focus on the colonies in the last two decades has given it a much needed shot in the arm

== Points of Interest ==

# Western Market. Open air market, mostly used for foodstuffs and locally-produced goods.
# Sura Harbor. An ancient harbor right near the fork in the river. Protected by a pair of rock breakwaters, it mainly caters to heavy cargo barges coming in both directions. 
# Sura House (the palace/residence of the ruling Sura family). A remnant of the old days, the core structure pre-dates the Dragon Tyrant.
# Temple of the Congregation United. Ecumenical (divine-oriented) temple. High priestess is Aeshia Sura, sister to lord Ishval Sura. Her particular patron is [[Lae Loara]], in her aspect as patron of the wilds.
# [[Jalshea Trading Company]] headquarters. Owned by the Ajagars, the Jalshea Trading Co. has a local monopoly on shipping to and from the colonies and maintains several large plantations on the south side of the Sheo. Always looking to expand and find new markets, the JTC owns a large chunk of the city as well.
# Inn of Bountiful Waters. The "high class" inn in town. Caters to traveling nobles and the religious.
# Scholastica Sura. The Scholastica is a branch of one of the larger orders dedicated to the preservation and recovery of old knowledge. The few arcanists in Surat are members of the Scholastica. The Scholastica is neutral in all political squabbles.
# House of Reflections. Home to the local branch of Listeners, those dedicated to hearing and communing with the [[kami]]. Extremely conservative.
# Covered market. High-end goods, as well as auction space used for "curiosities" and loads of exotic materials coming from the colonies or tribal trading parties.
# Open Road Inn. Competitors to #6. Specializes in entertainment, including much found scandalous by the upper classes. Doesn't mean they don't come, however.

== Rulership ==
Surat is home to one of the First Families, the [[Sura family]]. The head of the Sura is Ishval Sura, a human male in his 50s. Known for his conservatism and devout reverence for both the gods and the local kami, he is often accused of putting religious duties above the needs of the common folk, while he and his family wallow in unearned wealth and claim it to be the blessing of the gods and spirits. 

The other major family here is the [[Ajagar family]], who are very heavy into the colony trade and own many large plantations. They are traditionally strong allies to the Sura family and are categorized as part of the Second Families. The head of Ajagar is Reginald Ajagar, a human male in his mid 30s. Young and driven, Reginald has been involved in the colonies and strongly favors development and expansion. He notoriously cares little for the will of the gods or the warnings of the spirits.

== Factions ==

* Gardeners -- the Sura family and Temple. Values: Conservative growth, piety, nobility. Believe that unless managed carefully, growth will destroy everything. Status quo is god. Gods bless those who don't rock the boat and know their place.
* Voices of the River -- The local Listeners and druids. Anti-growth. Believe that man damages the environment and calls down the wrath of the kami on them. And are willing to help be the wrath of the kami, even if the kami aren't ready for that yet.
* Commercialists -- Ajagar Family and other colonial families. Populists…or rather using the populace as cover. Mainly interested in growth and wealth. Non-religious.
* Populares -- Rabble-rousers among the people. Not revolutionaries, but "advocating for the good of the people".
* Scholastics -- want to learn more about the reweaving and other effects. Will pay for artifacts &amp; knowledge.
* [[Laughing Ghosts]] -- Local "underworld" organization. Mainly smugglers, thieves, and "vice" (drugs and prostitution). Head is The Laughing Man, aka [[The Ghost of Surat]].

      <text bytes="3033" sha1="rjqeblgdkfaejszlrw4t6n498ucs86v" xml:space="preserve">A city of approximately 16k people, located along the Jao River, as well as the name of the surrounding district of [[Ikela]].

== District ==
[[File:Jaora.png|thumb|Jaora City]]Smallest and least prestigious of the districts, considered somewhat backward and superstitious by most (especially the "progressive" eastern cities of [[Mirzapor]] and [[Varanasi]]). Borders the districts of [[Calabar]], [[Rewa]], [[Bayannur]], [[Varanasi]], [[Sheopur]], and [[Surat]]. Most of the agriculture and productive land lies north of the Jao, where large silk and cotton plantations lie. The land to the south of the river, especially to the east, are swampy; many consider them cursed because the lair of the [[Kozhun|Dragon Tyrant]] was said to lie there.

=== Major Houses ===

* [[Jala]] family: the first (ruling) family of Jaora. Led by [[Rajai Jala]].
* [[Narbrook]] family: Owners of much of the north-country plantations. Desperate to escape the "backcountry" label and especially solicitous of the social trendsetters in [[Mirzapor]]. A branch family to the [[Jala]], as [[Rajaput Jala]] (father to [[Rajai Jala]]) was a [[Narbrook]] by birth and so most of the children are Narbrooks. Maintain a large estate on the southern side of the river in the city.
* [[Dhamatri]] family: Another substantial family that has fallen on hard times. While there is a district of the city named after them, they no longer own that area and only maintain a small house in the city. Their main estates are in the swamps to the south and east. Notable for being extremely difficult to pin down.

== City ==
An elongated snake-like city following the river. Not: the Mahaan is an alternate, local name for what most people call the Jao. The city's name means "City on the Jao."

=== Districts ===

* Helicodes: The poor and working-class district outside the wall to the north and east. While not a total slum, it's certainly close.
* Dhamatri: Formerly the estates and possession of the [[Dhamatri]] family. Now the "middle class" district, full of merchants, foreigners, and others who are not high status enough to live or work  within the walls but wealthy enough escape the Helicodes.
* Narbrook Estate: Home to the [[Narbrook]] family. Separately walled and with its own temple, it's a micro-city all in its self. Many of the residents (especially the higher-status servants) pride themselves on rarely having to leave the estate and mix with the unwashed around them. Includes private docks.
* Coin Quarter: Full of manufactories and warehouses for the wealthy merchants (unlike the poorer docks and warehouses in the Helicodes.
* Bridges: The "New Money" quarter.
* Blessed Quarter: Home of the major temple (Church of the Congregation, United). Old money district.
* Old Town: Formerly home of the old money, now mostly tenements for the servants of wealthy folks living in Bridges or Blessed Quarter.
* Majal Jao: The palace of the Jala. Walled and fortified, unlike most of the First Family palaces.

      <text bytes="1487" sha1="4mgzxmozx31ta5b3hoke9zd9fx8wsar" xml:space="preserve">Of the [[Orcs|orcish]] tribal groups in [[Wyrmhold]], Kard is the least traditional and most pragmatic and worldly. They make their homes dominantly in the southern region of [[Byarmarsh]], where they are heavily involved in the growing industrial movement there. Taking inspiration from the endless inventiveness of the [[goblins]] and the arcane bent of the local [[dragonborn]], they are technologists, engineers, and traders. For the decades of the war against the [[Hungering Frost]], they built weapons and manned engineering crews. Now they...still build weapons, but also look for new markets for engineered goods throughout the continent.

Politically, they're split between the [[Wyrmhold Politics|Byarmarsh Munitions Coalition of the War Party]] (most common among those who own and operate the weapons factories) and the [[Wyrmhold Politics|Trade Collective of the Peace Party]]. They are almost entirely irreligious, although those that do seek religion often seek out [[Lon-Ka]] as their patron. One common feature is that many of Kard despise [[Byssia]] and Byssians, especially for their anti-technological, "anti-progress" ways. They reject the druidic and shamanistic practices of [[Skem]], and consider [[Ko]] to be a bunch of savages. They do get along well with [[Tabar]], despite not being motivated by honor or the glory of combat. They prefer someone else (or something else) to do the dying, while they provide the weapons.

Living in the northern forests, they serve as the buffer between the "civilized" folk and the "wild" tribes (whether [[Orcs|orcish]] or [[Puun Ihmisia|ihmisi]]). They live in much the way that their ancestors did since the [[Cataclysm]]--hunting, gathering, finding treasures in the ruins of the old Free State cities that dot the forest. They are led by shamans and war-leaders.

Politically, they're neutral, although growing numbers of the younger folks are either renouncing their tribal affiliations or joining the Blood of Heroes. They look at [[Tabar]] as at glory-hounds who have sold out, despise [[Kard]] as being "soft" and "settled", and are somewhat in awe of [[Skem]]. In fact, it's only the tie to the shamans of [[Skem]] that keeps them nominally affiliated with [[Wyrmhold]].

They train most, if not all, of the tribal shamans for the other three tribes, as well as many of the surrounding tribes. They even train [[ihmisi]] shamans. As such, they provide an anchor. It was under the guidance of the head shaman of [[Skem]] back in the day that the four tribes allied with the [[dragonborn]] in the first place to repel the [[Hungering Frost]].

Politically they are officially neutral, but they exert subtle influence toward keeping the nation together and brokering peace between the factions.

{{Poem|
Floating Dowm &lt;br&gt;
The tower is a tentacle &lt;br&gt;
We land light as a fea-ther&lt;br&gt;
Only one eyed slaves home&lt;br&gt; 
In the lab&lt;br&gt;
The bodies are in suspen-sion&lt;br&gt;
Tortured and abused&lt;br&gt;
Discarded when they're used&lt;br&gt;
Enig-ma&lt;br&gt;
Began the great destruction wave &lt;br&gt;
Brun it out, said Zeke&lt;br&gt;
We went down to make them pay &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It hurts my brain, it blasts my feelings&lt;br&gt;
It's face a squid, its minions crawling&lt;br&gt;
I can see through smoke and boiling flame &lt;br&gt;
The swords flash, but I can't move out of their way&lt;br&gt;
An armored child, flies upon a peryton&lt;br&gt;
A dark haired man thrusts his blade through&lt;br&gt;
Now I see the minions fall and tumble &lt;br&gt;
Zeke burns it all, I just don't understand&lt;br&gt;
This is not how I am&lt;br&gt;
I___I, have become, &lt;br&gt;
psychically stunned &lt;br&gt;

Down the chute&lt;br&gt;
Just another lab room &lt;br&gt;
They're all dead in the tanks &lt;br&gt;
It made me feel angry and sick&lt;br&gt;
"Can you stand up?&lt;br&gt;
Come with us" said my good friend Tsun &lt;br&gt;
Dragging me through the smoke and gore &lt;br&gt;
See minions on the floor &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It hurts my brain, it blasts my feelings&lt;br&gt;
Who killed the squid, why is it falling? &lt;br&gt;
I can see through smoke and boiling flame &lt;br&gt;
The swords flash, but I can't move out of their way&lt;br&gt;
A sword comes, pulled aside by the peryton&lt;br&gt;
The magic blows it all asunder &lt;br&gt;
Now I see the minions twitch and moan &lt;br&gt;
Zeke burns it all, I just don't understand&lt;br&gt;
How did this all begin &lt;br&gt;
I___I, feel so numb, &lt;br&gt;
psychically stunned &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Down we go, &lt;br&gt;
my limbs can now obey me&lt;br&gt;
We find a pool of water, &lt;br&gt;
There's a kraken coming up&lt;br&gt;
Blades now flash&lt;br&gt;
There's nothing but the carnage&lt;br&gt;
And now we've got the copper bells&lt;br&gt;
And we're looking for a harp&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My brain still hurts, I hate this feeling &lt;br&gt;
More squid faced wizards try to harm me &lt;br&gt;
Attack my friends, I make them pay.&lt;br&gt;
The doors open, and it's just more confusion&lt;br&gt;
The basement is here, &lt;br&gt;
Our long descent is ended &lt;br&gt;
The harp is gone our search a failure &lt;br&gt;
The docks burn, the rioters roar &lt;br&gt;
We take a ship or two, to sea we fly &lt;br&gt;
The barrel tapped &lt;br&gt;
My throat is warm&lt;br&gt;
I___I, love the rum&lt;br&gt;
It makes me numb &lt;br&gt;

Houses [[Seren]] and [[Tuathail]] are the [[High Houses]] most prominent. Since the breakup of the [[Council Lands]], the AU has fallen out of favor. In many ways, the AU is most similar to the official position of the [[Kel'tan]] Empire of [[Soefra]], but with much less power.

== Godblin ==
Due to an encounter with an ancient dwarven-made chair under _________, Oopsie partially ascended and took on traits of [[Lucian|lucians]]. This provided some semblance of wild magic as well as a resurrection ability that prevented his death at one point.

== Personality ==
Randomness personified. Insulting.

Ideal: Freedom. I do what I want.

Bond: My party are my friends.

Flaw: No sense of propriety, prone to "experiment" on others without their consent.

Since the end of the Frost's reign over the Caldera, it has become a much more friendly place, with construct-driven lifts carrying cargo and passengers up and down and switchbacks taming the steepness of the descent.

Of the four orders of the church, it holds the most secular power and many outside observers claim is the real power in the nation, no matter what they claim about their communitarian policies. They focus on economic and cultural matters and often act as judges and bureaucrats. They have subsumed the [[Oracles]] into their order in large part.

== Ranks ==
Officially, all moon-scythes are equal, with positions merely denoting areas of responsibility. Unofficially, some Brothers and Sisters rank higher.

* Patriarch: The head of the order.
* The Citizen Advisory. These four Advisors (Paul, John, George, and Peter (no, not Ringo)) are the ones most responsible for the order and the nation as a whole.
* Oracles
* Wandering Brothers and Sisters
* Settled Brothers

Very few records remain of the kingdom or its people, as the oral histories were lost in the upheaval.

They were chosen for their physical resemblance to the Queen, and then underwent painful reconstructive magic and surgery (and a harsh training regimen) to become almost exact duplicates of the queen, at least outward. They served as her eyes, ears, voice, and hands among the people, acting as spies, assassins, messengers, and occasionally were married off to favored nobles as rewards for service. The current Queen's Voice (high priestess) was one of the Handmaidens.

Handmaidens trained in all the arts, both of pleasure and of killing, at the monasteries and a secret training facility.

Currently, handmaidens are chosen for political influence, rather than piety or even resemblance. They are still trained as assassins and spies, however.

* [[Plane of Stone]]: [[Korokonolkom]], god of Mountains
* [[Plane of Coal]]: [[The Gnoman]], an oddity--this is a collective congress of figures rather than a single individual.
* [[Plane of Lava]]: [[Alastor, World Judge]], a [[Wyrm]] with delusions of being the incarnation of justice.
* [[Plane of Flame]]: [[Pyros, the All-consuming Flame]], another oddity, this is a fire elemental with sentience. Lives to burn.
* [[Plane of Lightning]]: [[Horagall, the Thundering]]. A former Storm Giant, turned elemental lord.
* [[Plane of Smoke]]: [[Fecor the Inscrutiable]]. Not much is known about this figure.
* [[Plane of Wind]]: [[Shaher, Voice of Creation]]. A winged, feathered "dragon" figure. Probably not actually a dragon.
* [[Plane of Cloud]]: [[Lamies the Silent]]. Doesn't talk much.
* [[Plane of Ice]]: Currently without a lord since the death of [[Isskap]] at the hands of the [[Wild Cards]]. As a result, it's fairly unstable.
* [[Plane of Ocean]]: [[Gremory]], titled "Keeper of Secrets Old and New." Said to be an aspect or offshoot of [[Leviathan]].
* [[Plane of Mud]]: Without a lord--no one who spends time here can be bothered. Muddles (pun intended) along just fine without one, though.

      <text bytes="3351" sha1="rlxtybnwn2lvi4a4jnajk861bjqxhn1" xml:space="preserve">&lt;blockquote&gt;Imagine you had a garment, all of one color. Rather, you have ''dozens'' of garments, each of different color and thread. And someone comes along and cuts them to pieces, some large, some small. But you need clothes, so you have to reassemble the garments piece by piece. But it's dark, so your clothes end up a patchwork. Ok, maybe that analogy is flawed... --  Dhirtarashtra Gharapure, scholar of the Reweaving.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In approximately 247 AC (but exact timing is unknown due to the effects of the event itself), something happened that fractured history and memory throughout the east-central [[Great Rift]]. Memories and records from various locations do not match, and physical artifacts and peoples are mixed together in ways that defy reason.

== Area of Effect ==
As far as anyone from [[Ikela]] knows, the effect is confined to the watershed of the Ind river and its children the Jao and Sheo. The effect seems most pronounced (smallest "shards" and most discontinuities) as you go further south and west; the capital region and bay are only mildly affected (with regions the size of a city or larger being internally consistent). By the time you reach [[Surat]], only ''blocks'' are consistent, and the river-side colonies are yet worse affected. Within any shard (and even between adjacent shards), memories are whole--no one remembers a discontinuity. It's only by observing separated shards that the picture of the damage becomes clear.

Outside of [[Ikela]] and its surroundings, this event is not known at all.

== Theories ==

=== Alternate Probabilities/Shards of If ===
This theory holds that there are many possible universes, existing in parallel and branching off when decisions happen. "Something" happened to shatter some of the parallel universes and then stitch the fragments together like a stained-glass window. This theory is most common among the scholarly.

=== Malicious Memory Modification ===
This theory says it's a mass delusion, brought about by some malign power. This theory is most common among the common folk, who have any number of candidates for blame (a common one is the Evil Dragon, said to be reborn).

=== Divine Curse ===
This theory attributes it to divine (or primal) interference, usually for the sins of mankind. This theory is most common among the religious.

== Truth ==
As discovered by [[Tempus Machina]], the Reweaving was a several-fold event. The first trigger was when a (now nameless) [[gwerin]] archmage from the [[Phoenix Empire]] breached the inner containment at &lt;tower&gt;, opening a channel for the [[Adversary]] to begin to fill the outer containment. The proximate cause for it happening right at that juncture was [[Fai]], under the guidance of his uncle, the former Watcher, interfaced with the outer containment wards, causing the door to open and a blast of the [[Adversary]]'s influence to leak out, followed by a steady leak. This, as theorized by the scholarly, shattered the multitudes of worldlines in a local area. The damage would have spread, except that the [[Archon of Time]] intervened, melding the shards together across the affected area.

The [[Adversary]] was defeated permanently by [[Tempus Machina]] in 251 AC. This did not cure the reweaving effect, but did prevent any further damage.

      <text bytes="3165" sha1="l8fbs8056b1993j3xjwve7ec4oillzs" xml:space="preserve">Known as the "Evil Dragon" or the "Dragon Tyrant", this green dragon swept out of the lands south of [[Ikela]] with an army of [[zandolit]], [[humans]], and other dragons, along with some dragon riders, in about 250 BC. He conquered what is now [[Ikela]] and subjugated its peoples under his claws.

His capital was in the middle of the great "island" of Jaoshepar, building a city that was abandoned after his fall (and considered cursed). The proximate cause, as discovered by the [[Nameless Soefra Party]], was that a devil-inspired group of assassins from the [[Kingdom of Mirzapor]] had slaughtered his mate [[Aluadi]] and his young clutch of children under the banner of an emissaries..

== Policies ==
Kozhun's policies are best described as "stationary bandit". He extorted taxes and slaves from the conquered peoples, subjecting them (via viceroys) to his every whim. Rebellion, refusal to pay taxes, or even just displeasing him (or failing to amuse him) resulted in raids by his draconic allies.

== Downfall ==
In 97 AC, heroes gathered in [[Mirzapur]] and a rebel army (aided by the [[Moonshell Dragon Flight]] and the undersea residents of [[Ikel'Mer]]) drew the Kozhun's attention (and that of his forces) away from the heroes. They entered his lair, destroyed the source of his power (said to have been stolen souls trapped in glass vessels), causing him to falter and be downed by the ancient of the Moonshell. He was then killed by the common folk of the rebel army and his army was scattered.

Of course, not everyone agrees with this tale...

== Other Timelines ==
In another timeline, nameless adventurers saved his mate from the assassins and forestalled a war of retribution. In that timeline, the Kingdom and the Dragon became friends, until 96 AC when the Kingdom fell to devil-worshipers of the cult of [[Korv'al'zagan]] and raised a fiendish army to besiege his capital. More nameless adventurers assisted him in holding out, preventing the initial fall of the walls to treachery and providing critical assistance against the fiend-dragon leader of the invasion. They held out until [[Aluadi]] and their allies among the [[Red Lightning]] flight arrived. What happened after that is unknown to the prime timeline.

In yet another, where the [[gwerin]] did not retreat from the [[Great Rift]], Kozhun and [[Aluadi]] were local rulers, peacefully coexisting with the other kingdoms. When the Fragment was released from its prison in 247 AC (the cause of the [[Reweaving]] in the prime timeline) and gathered its army of corrupted creatures, Kozhun, Aluadi, and the hosts of heavens and hells gathered at [[Greenwood Reach]] for the final battle, with the failsafe of angelic destruction of the continent. The suspiciously timely arrival of yet more nameless adventurers (who seemed to be similar to the ones from the other timelines) allowed the [[Eyes of Qa'desh|Right Eye of Qa'desh]] to be brought to a ritual, which weakened the Fragment and protected the allies long enough for them to banish it to the [[Oblivion Gate]], weakening its influence across all timelines.

We all know that the world is made out of one form of thing--[[anima]]. This author will use the words anima and aether interchangeably, but mainly the latter. Because he thinks it flows better off the tongue. That said, even though aether is one substance, the forms of matter in the world are many. Why? How do we discuss the elements, if fire and water are really just aether?

The answer, friends and colleagues, is ''aspecting''. There are, I believe, 4 primal ''elements'', each of which comes in two ''cardinalities'' and two ''densities''. All together, this makes 16 ''aspects,'' although we usually speak of the 8 prime aspects (disregarding density). And we all know that 8 and 16 are the numbers of perfection, so this must be the correct number. These aspects work in pairs, pushing and pulling that all may be in balance.

=== Elements ===
The elements are four: fire, earth, air, and water.

Fire is aggressive, water is reactive. Earth is stubborn, air is fickle.

Fire burns, earth crushes and covers, water erodes, air tears apart.

Fire illuminates, earth builds, water refreshes, air inspires.

=== Cardinalities ===
''Luminous'' aether is bright, infused with potential and bubbling with possibility, breaking down the status quo and bringing change. ''Umbral'' aether is sluggish and calm, promoting stasis and constancy.

=== Densities ===
''Diffuse'' aether cannot be seen by the normal eye, surrounding all things. It interacts with the nimbus, not the body. ''Condensed'' aether is physical and interacts with the body, not the nimbus.

=== Prime Aspects ===

|}
Given all of this, how do the aspects move and flow throughout Quartus? Via the veins of the earth, called ley lines.

=== Ley Lines ===
Channels for aetheric flow, they surround us. Imperceptible to most, even to the mages (normally), they channel energy. Do they change the world...or do they reflect the changes in the world? Lines of water tend to follow rivers...but do rivers change course because the ley line moved, or did the ley line move because the river changed course? I don't pretend to know. What I do know is that the lines matter. Metaphysical changes follow the lines and boil up into the perceptible world at and near ''nodes'', places where ley lines converge, diverge, or intersect. These come in four different categories--divergent nodes (fonts), where luminous-aspected aether bursts forth into the shell we can perceive, convergent nodes (sinks), where umbral-aspected aether sinks down into the parallel worlds, contrasting intersection nodes (clashes), where two or more lines of opposing aspects draw close together and conflict, and complementary intersection nodes (harmonies), where two or more lines of complementary aspects intersect and mingle, bringing forth new forms of matter in their union.

Pride themselves as being "rulers" of [[Ghenna]], although the other families of that territory say it's only because no one else wanted the job, and they rarely listen to Don Zagan except humoring him. The truth is...complicated.

Their motto is "I am the only king! All will bend the knee to my majesty!". And true to that, they specialize in tyranny and authoritarian oppression. Means vary from supporting the direct conquest of areas to manipulating mortals from behind the scenes until all power rests in their hands.

== Notable Devils ==
=== Leadership ===
; Don Zagan : LE. Serves as the titular "Ruler of Hell" (well, [[Ghenna]]). Isn't much concerned with the mortal world or his underling's actions, as long as he gets his cut. Fosters the antagonism between his underlings to prevent them from taking his spot.
; Underboss Xel'seka : LE. Tyranny, subjection, enslavement. Called "Slavelord". Very much a fan of direct action rather than subtle manipulation.
; Underboss Ikal'seka: NE. Shadowy rulership. Patron of viziers everywhere. Diametrically opposed to Xel'seka.
=== Caporegimes and Brigadiers ===
; Brigadier  [[Korv'al'zagan|Korv'al]]: LE. Works under Ikal'seka. Epithet is "The Snake in the Grass" His area of responsibility encompasses [[Ikela]] and its surroundings. Some timelines have him strongly connected to the Dragon Tyrant [[Kozhun]].

      <text bytes="4091" sha1="g5r99pkskygqeoymthuq0w3dnoxs95y" xml:space="preserve">An organized underworld organization active throughout [[Surat]] Province of [[Ikela]] and into the Ikelan Colonies. Centered in the city of [[Surat]], it has connections to much of the trade (both licit and illicit), transportation (especially of goods coming from the colonies to the south), as well as various vice, gambling, prostitution, and protection rackets. On a very rare occasion, they can be hired to perform "wet work" (assassinations and kidnappings).

Their headquarters is in the sewers on the north-west side of the city, as well as extending past the walls. It's rumored that they have an entire shadow town down there.
[[File:Laughing ghosts insignia.png|thumb|Insignia (usually doesn't include the text)]]

== Organizational Structure ==
The Ghosts are split into three groups, each with different areas of focus. At the top are the Boots, who are the leadership cadre as well as the internal enforcement division. The other two, parallel groups are the Right Hand Path, , and the Left Hand Path, who handle all of the truly criminal operations.

=== Boots (Leadership) ===
The head of the Laughing Ghosts is the Laughing Man, aka the Ghost of Surat. This figure is, as his name suggests, a jovial but enigmatic entity. There has been a Laughing Man since [[Surat]] was founded, back during the occupation of the [[Kozhun|Dragon Tyrant]]. Whether it's a title passed down from leader to leader or a single long-lived individual is unknown. He only meets with his direct subordinates, the Day Man and the Night Man, as well as his chosen enforcers (nicknamed The Teeth).

The Day Man is responsible for overseeing all the operations of the organization during the hours of the night (yes, that's backward). A charismatic human male in his 30s, he's known for having risen through the ranks much more rapidly than is usual. He's been a strong proponent of the Left Hand Path and expanding the operations into the Colonies.

The Night Man is responsible for all the daytime operations. She's an older [[zandolit]] woman, of unknown clan. Cautious and traditional, she prefers the slower (but safer) route of working at least mostly in the law (other than tax evasion, but that's normal).

The Teeth are a cadre of unknown size. They do not socialize with the rest of the organization, and are deployed to crush insubordination or to make examples of subordinates who step out of line. Known for being ferocious fighters and incredibly tough, as well as unfailingly loyal to the Laughing Man.

=== Right Hand Path ===
The right hand path specializes in all the legal and semi-legal (or tolerated, within limits) practices such as tax-evasion smuggling, organizing workers on the docks, providing protection (both legally as guards and illegally as "insurance"), running gambling dens, dealing in the softer drugs (mostly blissweed, a mostly harmless narcotic that is legal, although disfavored), managing brothels and other forms of "companionship" (including high-priced escorts for nobles at parties), money lending, etc. In this, they interact heavily with the [[Jalshea Trading Company]] and are at least partial owners of a substantial fraction of many of the businesses. They prefer to take an operational stake in businesses rather than giving open-ended or collateralized loans.

Their leaders are known as the Right Thumb, Right Eye, and Big Toe.

=== Left Hand Path ===
The left hand path specializes in all of the more traditionally criminal behaviors. These range from smuggling contraband (ranging from hard drugs to artifacts to slaves), theft and fencing of stolen goods, and proscribed magics to outright mugging and (rarely) murder and kidnapping for profit. The Left Hand Path prides itself on having very few scruples. For a price, they can be hired to do almost anything. It's rumored that they have an agreement with the city guards (who are the liegemen of the [[Sura family]]), letting them get away with much more than they should have.

Their leaders are known as the Left Thumb, Middle Finger, and Nose.

Orchestrated by cultists of the [[Jester]], but egged on and abetted by [[Gozh]], this plot involved dominating members of the [[Breath of the Sun]] and planting assassins in the People's Faction ranks during a speech by the Queen-Mother at the Little Dawnspire in [[Lyodnoir]]. Interestingly, the Queen-Mother knew (or strongly suspected) that there would be an attempt and set things up so that the People's Faction would be blamed when it succeeded, tying them to [[Byssia]] and trying to sacrifice herself to keep the War Party on top. This plot was foiled when [[Enigma]] caught on to parts of it during their time in the city. Their presence at the speech stopped the assassination and revealed the Queen-Mother's role in abetting it, leading to her relegation to a purely ceremonial role.

Demon prince of chaos and insanity, his plots are so convoluted that his cults often end up taking both sides and working against each other. Which is how she wants it. Their origin and nature are unclear. Some believe that it is the most ancient demon prince, dating back well into the 1st Age. Others say zhe is more recent than the [[White Skull]].

This being is too insane and random even for Pinwheel. Any semblance of coherence or direction is abhorrent to it. It plots against everything and everyone, itself included. It glories in insanity, malicious tricks, false prophecies, and other deceptions. Its cult appears to act randomly. Some observers are worried that this appearance of randomness is actually a cunning façade. It never puts in a personal appearance and does not seem to respond to sacrifices. Additionally and anomalously, its cultists do not practice [[blood magic]] and sacrifice as much as others (although, being utterly chaotic, they still do occasionally).They have "followers", other demons that act in its name. How much of a connection exists is unknown.

The capital city of the [[Tuura Adam]] in the [[Giant Spine Mountains]]. At the base of [[Skypiercer Peak]], it also contains the entrance to an ancient, 1st-age [[Titan Conclave]] citadel, now mostly non-functional. Home to about 12,000 [[jazuu]] and giants.

Called "the city of the Code", it is the spiritual and cultural center of [[Tuura Adam]] life. Home to the only known [[Titanwall]] in operating condition in western [[Noefra]], it is a place of yearning and striving for most [[jazuu]]...or a place to stay away from.

== The Paths of the Code ==
[[Tuura Adam]] culture is bound up in the Code, the complex legal, cultural, and social "rulebook". Unlike most such sets of rules...these are written. And debated, altered, and updated. Children become adults when they commit to a Path, one of the sanctioned "professions" and begin dedicating their life to that pursuit. In most places, the low population does not permit physical and social separation of those on different Paths. Kozhuyn is different. The valley at the base of Skypiercer Peak is divided by road and canal into 8 Paths, and only members of septs (sub-divisions) of that Path (or children) can live in those areas. There is a rough social hierarchy, corresponding roughly to closeness to the mountain fortress of [[Too Tekterin]].
[[File:City-of-the-code.webp|thumb]]

=== Grain Path ===
The Path of Grain is the Path devoted to food production. Furthest from the mountain, this is mostly rural and farming terrain. Giants here tend to be hill giants and rarely stone giants.

=== Artiste Path ===
The Path of Artistry is somewhat odd, in that it encompasses several very different things--forestry and mining (non-food resource production, generally) as well as the fine and visual arts. It holds the western flank of the valley, with the lower slopes being more for the artists. Giants here are hill and stone, with more of the latter close to the city proper.

=== Coin Path ===
The Path of Coin is devoted to commerce of all types. Most of the buildings here are either warehouses or shops, often with housing above them.

=== Industry Path ===
The Path of Industry is devoted to converting raw materials into finished goods of all types. It is located in the inner ring of the city, what most call the beginning of the city proper. The buildings here are workshops with living quarters attached. Fire giants are known to visit this area, but mostly live on the mountain itself.

=== Hospitality Path ===
The Path of Hospitality is the home of restaurants, inns, taverns, breweries, as well as the performing arts (including prostitution, which is not stigmatized). Outsiders usually stay here. This is also where most of the temples are found, with a few exceptions. Few giants live or visit here, despite its closeness to the mountain itself..

=== War Path ===
The Path of War is home to those who protect and train to fight. Most of this is hunting parties that track down and destroy monsters in the outlying areas, often led by frost giants.

=== Spoken Path ===
Of the 8, this is the highest-status path other than the Path of Ascendancy. These are those who devote their time to studying the intricacies of the Code, mediating disputes, judging contests, and preparing candidates for the Trial of Ascendancy (the process of using the Titanwall to transform into a giant). Priests live here, and the Temple of Storm and Lightning (devoted to [[Perkunos]] and [[Tatsuryuu]]) is located here, near the entrance to the ruins of the Conclave hold-fast inside the mountain as well as the start of the road up to [[Too Tekterin]].

=== Ascendant Path ===
The Path of Ascendancy are those who have transcended their jazuu nature to become giants, especially the "higher" ones (frost, fire, and cloud). They live on terraces carved by Titan magic in the First Age, carved into the side of Skypiercer Peak itself. At the peak is [[Too Tekterin]], home of the High Judge, [[Bulut Boron]].

The hosts of Chaos were endless, and they were winning. Brave sacrifices by our beleaguered forces had kept them at bay for two days, but we were stretched to the limit. And then ''it'' arrived, riding its skeletal dragon. The [[Nameless]] itself, cloaked in the body of a [[gwerin]] mage, the fool who had summoned it from its prison in the [[Abyss]], thinking to control it. Even the greatest of dragons on our side quailed before the waves of power emanating from it. Our forces began to fall back, toward the Mothertree, hoping (largely in vain) that its powerful aura could shelter us for a while.

What saved us, in the end, was utterly unexpected. A sound, a trembling, a groaning, audible over the sound of the battlefield, coming from the south. Spells began guttering out or running wild; conjured creatures began vanishing or exploding in showers of anima. The gods themselves fell silent, and the elements and [[kami]] began screaming. The [[Cataclysm]] had begun.

How did that save us? Bereft of the air-aspected anima needed for flight and cut off from the vital essence of the world, [[Atijok]] fell from the sky and the [[Nameless]]'s sorcery failed. A last force of heroes rallied, burning their own life force to fuel the strike, lashed out, bringing the ancient horror to its knees. But it wasn't enough. Drawing on hellish power, the puppet body stood up again and a wave of fell power lashed out, stripping the souls from the heroes. And then, weakened by that strike, the most ancient of beings saw their chance. Eight figures, made from light, coalesced on the battlefield around the [[Nameless]], each one bearing a [[Fangs of Resolution|Fang of Resolution]]. They were the [[Primordials]], the First-Created, kin to the [[Nameless]], for he was one of them before the [[Prehistory|beginning of all things]]. They did not turn the blades on their rebel brother (for the Fangs cannot be used that way); instead they said the Words[1], later known as the Rite of Acceptance, and plunged the Fangs into their own breasts. With this act, they ended the age of [[Primordials]] and enforced Order, accepting Change (for that was the original name of the [[Nameless]]) into the world forever. From that day, all creation has freedom of will. No more are people born to evil or good, to law or chaos. Not even the angels or devils. All ''must'' choose for themselves and bear the consequences of that choice.

[1] These are the words:&lt;blockquote&gt;(Spoken in 8-part unison)

Outcast, Rebel, Stripped of Name and Station

Abyss-dweller, Prisoner, Bringer of Chaos

Now we greet you as Kin and Kith

(Spoken by the four representing the elements, in harmony)

When the elements were ordered, when all was ordained and structured

You counseled for limits to that order.

For freedom to become.

(Spoken by the Primordials of Death and Life)

Without Change, growth and creation are impossible

And death but a mirage

Eternal progress without Change is stagnation

(Spoken by the Primordial of Darkness)

I raised my voice against you, for I feared chaos unbridled

But what means stability without Change?

What benefit to Memory, if all is as it ever was?

(Spoken by the Primordial of Light)

The Law was spoken

The Law reigned

But what of the sinner? 

Without Change, can breaches (for breaches must come) be healed?

(Spoken in 8-part harmony, triumphantly)

For Change we name thee, 

Brother, Companion

And in token of this acceptance, now given

And in recompense and to seal the vow

This Sacrifice. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Located in relatively shallow waters, the main part of the city is located only 150 ft below the surface and there is a port area on a neighboring island with an elevator system (involving weights and flotation bubbles) for moving cargo up and down.

==Notable Things==
The city is protected by a dome-like barrier, which is permeable from the outside to those wearing identification tags registered with the city and to water and animals without hostile intent, but (almost) impermeable to hostile-minded animals or unregistered individuals. This is generated by an artifact known as the [[Kaigara]], tended by the Sea-Priests. Outsiders must register at the port and receive visitor tags before entry is possible.

==Population==
13,500 individuals are registered residents. This includes 8,650 [[kalasaa]], 4,350 [[ika-ika]], and the remainder of various races (mainly [[humans]]).

Where Mirrorhaven is attuned to the Astral, the Dreamlands are attuned to the elemental and the primal. This is the home of many of the fey, but especially the Winter Court. If Mirrorhaven is manic, the Dreamlands is soporific. The daily routine, the static sameness, the wilderness. If Mirrorhaven is deceptive, the Dreamlands is forthright in its madness. Here, the risk is depression and apathy. After a while, nothing seems to matter and the soul drifts into sleep. The spirits that find themselves here are those that were attuned to the primal, to the kami or to the elemental planes. They drift into slumber and disintegrate, meld with the layer, or force through to the Elemental and form bodies there.

The hub here is the [[Dream Titan’s Throne]]. This enormous (and physically inconsistent) castle, seemingly made of wood, rock, and bone changes from day to day; its inhabitants (mostly the fey) migrate around from “room” to “room” lest they get swallowed up in the dream and never awaken.

== Events ==

* Exploring [[Hammerhead]]. The [[Catalysts]] opened the portal to the ruins outside [[Hammerhead]] and found a different experience than that discovered by the [[Wild Cards]] in the mainline history. They found the city under siege by frost giants from the [[Nocthian Caldera]] and beset by tribes of human barbarians under the command of a trio of hags. The residents of the buried city were much more welcoming, but the heroes found themselves enmeshed in their politics, eventually discovering that the Archivist had been manipulating their civilization since the Cataclysm. After making peace between the dwarves and giants and defeating the Archivist, they made allies with the people and [[Crit Bot]] received a mechanical body as a reward.
* Side trip to the [[Plane of Stone]]. From [[Hound's Rest]], they received word of an ancient library at [[Tal Elamor]] unreachable even by divinities. They entered the [[Portal Network]] aiming for that ancient city's terminus, but intervention of a shadowy entity misdirected them to the [[Plane of Stone]]. After doing some work for the angels of the legion there, they made it out to [[Shadvaal]] and thence via portal to [[Tal Elamor]].
* Upon entry into the arcane maelstrom surrounding that city, they discovered it sectioned into zones and under threat by heavy [[Awakener]] infiltration. To reach the inner city, they first dealt with Wrath (possessing an archdruid) in the Primal sector before dealing with Gluttony (possessing a demilich) in the Merchant's Quarter. From there they defeated Greed and captured Lust (disembodied) in the Alchemy quarter, resolving the inter-faction war there. That gained them entrance into the inner city via the Arcane quarter, where they dealt with Pride (possessing an eye tyrant). Their last foe was Envy, who was posing as an angel-figure in the (mostly eaten by the sea) Divine Quarter. Sloth, as it turns out, had turned coat and gone native in the Quarter of Artifice and was not a threat. 
* With the city purged of [[Awakener]] influence, they turned their attention on the [[Eternal Library]]. Here they learned that the real reason for their presence was the manipulation of the Librarian, seeking candidates for the Fourth Wish, as the [[Cosmic Forge]] was primed for such an event. While they pondered, they were interrupted by the approach of several large armies from the southern nations. The most pressing threat was the Dragon King of [[Bel's Kush]], who had gathered souls to attempt the Wish; his goal was to create a "real" afterlife and enforce a notion of cosmic good and evil (partially undoing the free-will of mortals). The [[Catalysts]] opposed him, and met him in a debate battle in the [[Abyss]] (so as not to cause collateral damage). In the ensuing argument, the Dragon King was convinced that he had violated his own laws and was evil, which caused his grasp of the souls he'd taken (voluntarily and not) to waver and he...exploded. Good thing they were in the Abyss...
* With no other candidates, they decided to ask [[Crit Bot]] to make the sacrifice for the Fourth Wish, bringing about the beginning of the Age of Artifice.
* After returning home (sorely missing the entity they could no longer remember), they were contacted by a demigod they'd met--the [[Celestial City]] was under attack by [[Awakener]]-empowered demonic forces under the [[Twisted]], who was personally attempting to destroy the Core of the [[Great Mechanism]]. This they decided wouldn't do, so they came to do battle. And did battle, slaying the demon prince.
* From there, their battle took them to the outer edge of the universe at the [[Crystal Sphere]], where the [[Awakener]] had burst through. There they bought time for angelic forces to repair the breach, sealing the malign entity out. [[Vassarian Kabir]] realized his true nature as a shard of the mate of his patron, long-since destroyed in combat with the Awakener in that strange Dark realm beyond. He reunited with her, leaving the mortal coil forever.
* The rest of them retired, mainly to run a drug trade and be hippies.

After the Librarian self-sacrificed to end that invasion, the heroic little floating crystalline eyeball was repaired with a soul orb, becoming a full-fledged member of the party (although partial to [[Vassarian Kabir]]). It still accompanies him in his duties and is one of his best friends; he seems to understand its rude bleeps and noises where no one else does.

* An energy blast with wide variation (mechanically, crits on a 19-20) but low damage.
* Holographic recording and playback.
* Sarcasm. Tons and tons of sarcasm, expressed in mechanical bleeps and bloops.

== Other ==
In the non-canonical [[Catalyst Side Stories]], Crit Bot received a humanoid construct body, declared herself female, and eventually sacrificed her own existence to bring into existence the Fourth Wish.

      <text bytes="1567" sha1="3f8axgkm2jjwj1pc4qto9uijepm1wh8" xml:space="preserve">A device ostensibly created by the ancient [[dwarves]] (but really by the [[Titans]] before them) that uses the power of rune magic and memory crystals to rapidly transform raw materials into worked goods of highest quality and extremely fine tolerances. The heart of this, however, are the Runesmiths, dwarves who take shifts in wielding the Forges...at the cost of their own life energy. The only Rune Anvil in [[Noefra]] whose location is known belongs to the [[Dwarven Clans|Alkh clan]] and was located in [[Kaelthia]] until it was smuggled out in late 251 AC to avoid it falling into the hands of the [[Prophet of Law Unveiled]] and his zealots. It is a secret only known to a few that they really got it by betraying the original owners (the Bolor clan of [[Bolor Hold]]) to enemies and stealing it while the Bolor were being slaughtered. This anvil is the source of much of the Uulan wealth and power.

In its inactive state it appears similar to a large, rune-inscribed anvil. When activated it unfolds into a chair/"desk" combination of sorts. The wielder sits in the chair, raw materials are placed on the desktop, and the magic happens. Under normal conditions, an average wielder can create an entire suit of plate armor in a day of the finest [[Items and Crafting|dwarven steel]] (other than the padding and straps) from mere ingots. Most commonly it was used for pump housings for the great locks on the Kael River and pumps, pistons, and lift components for the mines under Mount Refuge and the Uulani range.

      <text bytes="1506" sha1="brswzpyayey5hprkec0barivkxkdv9q" xml:space="preserve">A tribal confederation located to the south west of [[Ikela]]. Their territory extends from the Jalshea River in the east out into the trackless jungles of the central [[Great Rift]] and from the &lt;name&gt; mountains that form [[Ikela]]'s western border on the north to the union of the three rivers into the Jalshea to the south.

The tribes of the Nightmare Scar are mostly united in their distrust for everything [[Ikela]]. They were many of the most devoted followers of [[Kozhun]] in his reign. In more recent times, they've started squabbling among themselves.

== Tribes ==

* Swift Spear: A small [[zandolit]] tribe that lost most of its members to a corrupted elemental creature (in league with the Gaping Maw). Now stabilized due to [[Nameless Soefra Party]]. Located along the river.
* Gaping Maw: A large [[zandolit]] tribe that had overwhelmed several others with corrupted strength. Suffered a major loss at the hand of [[Nameless Soefra Party]].
* [[Tor Ysa]]: A village of [[gwerin]] and humans that originated in a different [[timeline]]. Friendly. Located quite centrally.
* &lt;Shattered "human" tribes&gt;: The southern uplands tribes are all of human descent, originating in at least one other [[timeline]]. Not much is known about them.
* Windfoot tribe: Located along the Jao branch bordering [[Ikela]], this [[zandolit]] tribe believes themselves to be the heirs to the [[Kozhun|Dragon Tyrant]]'s empire. They hold onto a cursed relic of his reign.

Located north west of [[Ikela]], the two have been allies of convenience for generations, but relationships are somewhat strained right now (251 AC). By treaty, the flight controls all outside access to their lands.

== Organization ==
The flight proper consists of 2 ancient dragons, 6 adults, and a dozen young. Attached to the flight are three orders of [[Dragon knight|dragon knights]], bonded to [[drakkons]]. These latter serve as the local leadership in the villages of mortals that make up the bulk of the population.

Its nature is of bright colors, constant movement, and frenetic interplay of light and color. It is home to the Spring and Summer Court of the Fey, the assembly of spirits attuned to the “positive” emotions such as love, joy, devotion, pleasure, and the like. Do not be fooled by the names, however. Also associated with this layer is mania and illusion; nothing here is as it seems. Delusion is rampant; everything wears multiple faces. Decadence and lavish excess hide a hollow, insatiable hunger that cannot be filled—the shadow-stuff of which this is made is not stable or real enough to satisfy. The inhabitants continually search for greater and greater sensation to fill this numbness. The majority of the populace is the spirits of those departed mortal souls that were attuned toward the Astral, either as a life of devotion to the Gods or for personal reasons. Here they live a distorted reflection of their lives until either they lose track of who they are and dissolve into shadow-stuff, until they are devoured by one of the denizens, or until they press through to the [[Astral]] plane itself and carve out a residence there through transcendence.

The hub of Mirrorhaven is [[Centrum]]. This city once was the capital of the Western Empire of [[Noefra]] (known then as [[Imperial Center]]) until a tremendous magical explosion threw it into [[Shadow]] about 800 years ago. The inhabitants have become shadow-kin, beings made of shadow-stuff. All the decadence, excess, and mania of the layer are most concentrated here—the entire city is one continual, frantic, eternal festival. Souls drift in and are caught up in the celebration. The weak burn out quickly; the strong prey on the weak for survival.

Many of the gods and ascendants maintain enclaves here.

Located on an artificial island in the middle of [[Lake Coy'in]] (which was much smaller before the [[Cataclysm]]) and connected to the mainland by 16 bridges, it showcased the power and magico-technological might of the empire. Full of gleaming spires and magical lights, it was a wonderland...if you were rich. Hidden underneath (literally, buried in the foundations and piles that held it up) was an undercity of despair and filth, a breeding ground for the living fuel for the empire's insatiable hunger.

It was destroyed in the opening act of the [[War of Souls]], when a band of rebels, sickened by the corruption and evil acts of the empire's mage cadres (especially the creation of the [[Dragonborn]] at [[Imperial Research Alpha]]) sacrificed themselves to throw the city and its inhabitants into [[Shadow]] during a meeting of the Imperial Senate and Court.

Now known as [[Centrum]], it is the home of delusions and dreams, of bright color and predators, at the center of [[Mirrorhaven]].

All roads lead there...and none lead out. At least for the weak. The inhabitants of the mortal city it once was still prowl the streets a thousand years later, condemned to a shadowy existence, preying on the souls of the dead. The Spring and Summer Courts hunt there, bewitching mortal souls for their revels.

Very few that do enter it leave; of those, a few have reported seeing an eye, a calm spot that seems to drift around unpredictably. In that eye...a titanic fortress/city/''construct''.

It also forms the border between the [[Farthingale Duchy]] and the [[Eastwalk Dutchy]] (with the headwaters of the [[Eastwalk River]] lying in the latter and [[Baile Craan]] officially lying in the former).

The Craan is navigable for most of its length, although in 237 AC a system of locks were completed near the capital to allow upriver traffic (where before they'd had to switch to land-bound transport about 10 miles downriver). It ranges from between 80 and 150 feet wide, with most of its length being ~20 feet deep. Fed by snowpack, it floods occasionally during the spring, but generally not badly or destructively.

The city of [[Montavon]] lies on its banks near the headwaters. Unlike the [[Craan River]], the [[Westwalk River]] is only navigable for the lower 1/3 due to large numbers of rocks and rapids. The [[Farthingale Duchy]] has talked about doing something about that, but no moves have been made as of 251 AC.

* [[Jo'Vasha]]

== Adventures ==

* Meeting up in [[Surat]], they took a quest to handle issues with bugs and rats in the sewers there. They discovered active manipulation by forces later discovered to be in the pay of a member of the [[Sura family]], as well as a (false flag) attempt to sabotage the magical purification center for the sewers (with possibly catastrophic results).
* [[Into the Nightmare Scar]] : A trip across the river led to the discovery of corrupted elemental nodes, some elucidation of [[Fai|Fai's]] memories, and making some friends. And discovering the influence of [[Korv'al'zagan]]. As well as some weird timey-wimey stuff.
* Coming back into [[Surat]], they uncovered a devil-run plot to assassinate the [[Sura family]] head and blame it on the [[Jalshea Trading Company]]. This was stopped. [[Jo'Vasha]] also made friends with a pretty kitty. And the party killed the 3rd son of a noble of [[Sheopur]]. He had it coming, but...
* [[Cleansing Greenwood Reach]] From there, they headed south to a place known as [[Greenwood Reach]], where Fai made a fiendish friend and time got really really complicated.
*The trip to Fatehpur resulted in meeting powerful elven wizards and JoVasha's mom, who does ''not'' have it going on. Traveled south to investigate the magical storms that rage in this area.  Met the Two Moons half-elves.  Investigated the silver dragon in stasis and eventually freed her as well as restoring the song. 
*Varanasi was the next stop, and there's an infestation of demonic influence (Korv'al'Zagan yet again) they had to deal with. Ambushed, followed up and eliminated the cell.  Jo'Vasha's sweetie Katya is starring in a musical being put on the the old school which horrifically mangles the adventures and accomplishments of Tempus Machina, all in service of promoting Jo'Vasha as The Prophet.  The dream nodes arise as another possible quest soon.
*In Varanasi, they destroyed a dream node...which made a mess and knocked them into the [[Astral]]. They fled via self-banishment, but ended up in the [[Phoenix Empire]], interrupting [[Phoenix Princess Leina]]'s party.
*While in the Empire, they were accused of violating sacred law. While awaiting trial, Vasha had a direct encounter with the [[Archon of Time]] in a semi-dream state and...asked her out.
*The day of the trial came in the imperial palace. Cats and machinations ahoy. And meteors. Big mess happened, ending with the death of several members of the [[Archmagistrate of Kel'tan]] as well as the Eternal Emperor himself. Party fled back to Varanasi and then to the capital.
*There, they conspired and finally took down the dream nodes and the cult. Including blowing up the astral storage mechanism for all the siphoned power. And freeing the king from his imprisonment by the cult. The cult got outlawed.
*Party was made minor nobles
**Vijil got Morton's Thumb.
**Fai got &lt;the hospital place&gt;
**Erland got &lt;TODO&gt;
**Vasha got the post of Knight of Redwing, an island on the route from Ikel'mer to Fatehpur.
*After some downtime, they headed south toward Charn, hoping to find Erland's dad under the mountains.
*They discovered an Outsider (the Other) protecting a small village of Adversary-changed creatures, including Fai's uncle Alois. They strengthened the Other, which allowed them to be protected through the Vale of Corruption. They also fought some really nasty things.
*They freed some mutated ants. And touched a purple thing.
*Going undermountain, they found and allied with the [[Goroesi]] living there. They also found Erland's dad, suffering from amnesia.
*Searching for relics, they found the Mad One, a relic of ancient days. He had stolen a reliquary containing a piece of the Adversary's Name...supposedly. And in return, he wanted his own Name repaired, which required a sojourn in the Abyss, as it belonged to a demon called the Puppeteer.
*They played games with the Puppeteer, earning his favor as well as the favor of many of the other Demon Princes. Fai got a "card" from the Jester.
*Returning, they took a side trip to [[Aenimos]] so the Mad One could put his name back together. There they met and befriended [[Echidra]], rode on an airship, and talked to some people.
*Council of War.
*Now into the fire. Dropped the Other off to interfere with the surviving Archmagisters' plan to do BAD THINGS with all the death energy released by genocide.
*Approaching Charn.
*Fought through the outer defenses, broke into the Mindscape of the Adversary. Freed the captive [[Awakener]] elements, battled despair. Aided by gods and friends. Turned back time to smash [[Namebreaker]] into the Name of the Adversary, destroying it without destroying Hope/Despair
*Accepted the freed (former) awakener elements.

      <text bytes="2681" sha1="9hajyhnaiqbkmxui9lga8jmhvb6tfry" xml:space="preserve">Specifically ''living'' (or life-like) animated beings. Categories:

== Animatrons and Clockwork ==
These are the simplest form, either brought to life by spells temporarily or constructed around clockwork mechanisms and simple magicite-powered cores. They cannot learn or grow and are extremely restricted in their responses to new information. Clockwork cannot be reprogrammed once constructed. "Bound", long-duration animatrons can be found in ancient ruins, but the secret to constructing such has been lost. Simple clockwork can be constructed, but generally limited to toy uses and simple contraptions.

== Golems ==
Golems are bodies of unliving matter animated by summoned and bound elemental forces (usually a combination of earth, water, and air; fire is too volatile) in the form of True Words. Unlike animatrons, golems can be given new orders and are generally imprinted with a core set of commands to obey the one holding the control wand or their creator. Suited mostly for brute labor or simple defensive tasks, golems are incredibly expensive.

Two notable sub-types of golems exist in [[Noefra]]--the metal and crystal Labor Constructs of [[Wyrmhold]] and the wood and stone Shrine Guardians of [[Byssia]]. Representing very different approaches to the process.

'''Labor Constructs''' are built in factories, with cores created in a laborious, very carefully-controlled aetheric environment. The True Words are taken from the purest elementals that can be summoned and rebuilt into specific forms. As a result, labor constructs are effectively interchangeable. Their control structures are standardized by model and each model is specialized for a single task.

'''Shrine Guardians''' are carved by the Byssian [[ihmisi]] and ''sung'' into life, inviting primal spirits to inhabit them and leave traceries on their cores. Each one is unique in both form and nature, and their behavior is quite unpredictable. They are set to guard the deepest, most sacred parts of the forests.

From the two of these come the majority of the [[soul-forged]].

Golems can be made in even larger forms, such as [[Ar Dolema]], the walking construct-fortress of the [[Jungle of Fangs]].

== Higher Constructs ==
The [[shadesteel guardians]] of the [[Cysgoroesi]] are empowered by actual souls which have been [[Blood magic|pinned]] into soul gems. They are effectively mechanical people.

It is rumored that before the [[Cataclysm]], the technomancers of [[Hammerhead]] had discovered how to make advanced golems capable of individual growth and independent operation while not being actually sentient. The methods of constructing these cores is unknown, however.

This walking fortress is born by four colossal (~100' tall) [[Construct|golems]] and powered by an ancient aether reactor of unknown provenance. During the [[Fanged Kingdom]] it served as the real command center and center for the ruling caste (with [[Ar Salem Dolem]] as the "front" capital). After the masters departed, it walked in an endless circle through the woods 100 miles (ish) NW of [[Asai'ka (City)|Asai'ka]] until it was found and the demonic presence was purged by the [[Catalysts]]. It eventually settled into a stationary state at a "dock" NE of [[Ar Salem Dolem]].

== Origin ==
The origin of this structure is unknown. Its architecture and means of construction do not match those of any known civilization, and the golem-heart and reactor are of technologies unknown to history.

      <text bytes="5212" sha1="23zpxv5678i2vos5lmlu3h0bii61294" xml:space="preserve">A territory captain of [[Zagan]]. Works under Ikal'seka. Epithet is "The Snake in the Grass" His area of responsibility encompasses [[Ikela]] and its surroundings. Some timelines have him strongly connected to the Dragon Tyrant [[Kozhun]]. More subtle than many of his kin.
[[File:Korval Symbol.png|left|frameless]]

== Cult ==
He is known to have created a substantial cult, known as the "Korvite" cult (or just "the cult"), in [[Ikela]] proper. Since the earliest days of the Dragon Tyrant, it has been the secret power behind most of the goings on. Only rarely do cult members take the top role in any public-facing organization, and when they do it's not the leadership of the cults themselves. They prefer to hide behind a façade of legitimate power.

=== History ===
Founded in ?? by ??, it was responsible for sending the assassins who killed [[Kozhun]]'s mate and children, thus depriving him of his hoard and leaving behind a torque emitting corrupting whispers. After corrupting him for a few decades as he slept on her bones, the cult promised him a replacement hoard via secret ritual involving channeling energy to him from elemental [[Ley Lines|ley lines]] and worship through stolen or extorted dragon eggs (taken from neighboring flights) and up through a sacrificial victim. This progressively made him more and more insane, leading to the hyper-destructive Tyrant known to history. This was really just an experiment in channeling energy, partially superseded by information learned from the [[Stormveil Center]]. What they really wanted was a way to manipulate the anima, especially anima of ''belief'' on a large scale. When the leaders had learned what they needed, they transitioned to the next part of the plan, starting the final war of Kozhun's reign and sending the 8 "founding heroes" (secretly under the command of one of the Cabal) to destroy the ritual and thus make Kozhun vulnerable.

Since the fall of Kozhun, they have burrowed deeper into Ikelan society, infiltrating much of the nobility, organs of commerce, the Church and military. Their current plan involves creating a network of altered aether manipulation nodes around Ikela to redirect all worship to Korv himself, as well as make devil summoning easier and stronger within the area. Unwittingly, their efforts have contributed substantially to the event surrounding the  [[Reweaving]], and completing the network is likely to break the seal at [[Charn]] entirely, leading to the end of the world as we know it.

=== Organization ===
The cult is cell-like in organization, with a strong hierarchy both between cells and between cells. 

==== Cell Structure ====
Each cell has a Cell Leader, who commands the Followers, of which there are between 2 and 10. A Follower in one cell might be a Leader of a subordinate cell. Higher-level cells know about their subordinate cells but the reverse is not necessarily true. Followers may or many not know their fellows and generally don't know about cells on their same level, at least officially.

Cell members tend to put a lot of effort into espionage directed at other cells. Backstabbing and infighting are endemic, as betrayal, blackmail, and outright murder are known and accepted means of climbing the status ladder.

==== Hierarchy ====
Most of the hierarchy is between senior cells and subordinate cells. Power is measured by distance from the Cabal, the ruling group. The Cabal always consists of 7 members, themselves broken into three ranks, denoted by the color of their (illusory) masks.

'''Masters''': The two Masters wear white and black masks and know all the details about the Gold and Silver Masks. The White Mask is the High Summoner, the "spiritual" leader of the cult and the direct conduit to the will of Korv himself and is always a powerful mage and summoner. The Black Mask is the High Inquisitor, the mortal arm of Korv. His is the role of enforcer of cult policy, and he is always a warrior of consummate skill. The two of them tend to wander and their own identities are well-kept secrets.

'''Gold Masks''': The 3 Gold Masks are the senior members of the Cabal under the Masters. As of early autumn 251, [[Tempus Machina]] have discovered that one of the privy advisors to King Ikel III is a Gold Mask. The Gold Masks know the identities of the Silver Masks but not the White and Black or each others' (by default anyway).

'''Silver Masks''': The 2 Silver Masks are the junior members of the Cabal. As of early autumn 251, [[Tempus Machina]] have discovered that [[Esla]], head of the South-bay Trading Company in [[Varanasi]], is a Silver Mask. The Silver Masks only know the identities of their own subordinate chains as well as those they've discovered.

The actual mask and attire characteristic of the cabal (a blood-red robe over red-enameled plate armor, with face obscured by a shining, featureless mask of the appropriate color, voice distorted) is generated by their medallions. The actual medallions are powered by unknown forces but contain masking spells so they are magical only on the closest inspection. The medallions can be replaced but only by the White and Black masks acting together.

      <text bytes="4934" sha1="od957jm556zhfyzh239nskwtilrj75x" xml:space="preserve">Oldest continuously inhabited human city in the [[Great Rift]], it marks the (legendary) first landing point of humans in [[Soefra]]. Called "the City of Nobles" and "the city where history walks the streets." Despite its age, the only district that hasn't been rebuilt since the fall of the Dragon Tyrant (ca 150 YBP) is First Landing, and only the Old Palace itself dates back more than 200 years.

== Architecture ==
Mirzapor is a city of contrasts. It's full of grand estates and slums, often coexisting in a single district. The architecture is designed to look old, with upswept roof timbers and grey-tiled roofs. Walls are half-timbered at best; many are made of paper and latticework. Stone is rare and reserved for the Families (as well as the foundations for buildings built on the remains of what came before).

== History ==
Founded by the first settlers in about 1100 BC, it was the last bastion of "civilization" after the northern retreat from [[Soefra]]. The [[Kingdom of Mirzapor]] was founded there in about 600 BC. Under the reign of [[Kozhun]] it was notable for being the most harshly repressed city, ruled by the most cruel of the [[Dragon knight|Dragon knights]], with despotic laws enforced supposedly at the direct command of the Dragon Tyrant himself.

After the fall of [[Kozhun]], [[Ikelan Hero|Arjuna Mirza]]'s wife Apsalar threw her weight behind Rama Ikel, brother to [[Ikelan Hero|Ramajar Ikel]], the leader of the heroes, leading to Rama's ascension as King Ikel I. For that concession, Mirzapor has long considered itself the cultural and religious center of [[Ikela]].

== Demographics ==
Mirzapor is dominantly human, the least diverse city in [[Ikela]]. The only significant non-human population is in the Seafoam district, a combined land-and-water area for the [[kalasaa]]. A [[dragon knight]] named Roald of Moonshell occupies an estate with his companion in the Academy district and serves as the ambassador for the [[Moonshell Dragon Flight]] in the area.

The population of Mirzapor at the last census was 25430.

== Districts ==

* [[File:Mirzapor.png|thumb]]First Landing: Still surrounded by the remains of the original wall built by the first queen of of the [[Kingdom of Mirzapor]]. Small, cramped, but fabulously expensive houses as well as the main CCU temple. This is where the Mirza family and its close allies live; the Old Palace is also located here.
* Cliffside: The noveau riche live here, perched precariously above the river mouth.
* Garden: One of the newer districts, this is mostly occupied by the second-tier nobles (Third Houses) and upstart merchants playing petty noble.
* Sandor: Just down the hill from the Gardens, this was a nice area. It's now occupied by formerly-successful, but now struggling houses.
* Gorai: Mostly commercial, with many of the master crafters.
* North Docks: The nicer docks for goods coming from the bay. Carefully patrolled.
* Vihar: Home of the third-tier "nobles" and wannabes. Known for being ultra-straitlaced and aggressively socially conscious
* Naigon: Not as bad as Mulagon.
* Mulagon: The slums. Cramped warrens of rickety shacks. Located right in the main flood plains, it tends to wash away frequently (every few years). Locals say it keeps the stink down. The outer streets bordering it are actually built up 10' or so.
* Academy: Home of the [[Royal University of Mirzapor]], preeminent (in their own eyes at least) institution of higher education and learning. Surrounded by larger estates and pocket "farms" (mostly of flowers or other inoffensive, socially acceptable plants. 
* Rice Docks: One of two main landing sites for traffic coming down (or up) the river. More respectable than South Docks.
* South Docks: The other major riverine landing site. Known for having a heavy criminal element.
* Panju [Pan-zhu] Island: Home to one of the major "monasteries" and priestly training grounds for the CCU. Also, not coincidentally, home to the red light district. Connected to the North Docks by the White Span, an ancient, magically-enhanced bridge spanning more than 3000 ft of river, high enough for even tall-ships to pass under safely (although most do not). A few smaller islands to the north also are bridged--they contain gardens and green space owned by the Mirza family.
* Second Estate: Slums. More spread out than Mulagon, full of dockworkers, warehouses, and teamsters for the South and Rice docks. 
* Third Estate: Home to large "semi-country" estates for the Second Families. Places away from the prying eyes and wagging tongues of the city proper.
* Arjuna Naval Base: One of two major fitting yards for the Ikelan fleet, as well as Central Fleet Command and home of the Naval Archives.

Part of [[Nameless Soefra Party]].

Erland grew up in the small town of [[Pasona]] in the north of Ikela and was born to a human woman named Evelyn Nygaard. He never knew his father--Evelyn did tell Erland that his father was important and had people after him. So he left to protect them. On his 12th birthday, his mother gave him a heavy signet ring on a chain that she said had belonged to his father. A few months later, unfortunately, she died under mysterious circumstances. Erland wasn't convinced it was natural as Evelyn was perfectly healthy before. Erland was taken in by Qira Hastra, who was the town blacksmith, and her daughter Daelynn. Qira had been a good friend to Evelyn and Erland had been working with her since he was 10 in an informal apprenticeship.

When he was 13, some people came and told him he was being taken to a school for gifted and talented individuals in Varanasi. He jumped at the chance to see more outside of town, but wasn't sure why he was chosen. While he was there he made some friends (the rest of the group) and, for the most part, enjoyed his time there. He also had a habit of sticking up for others at the school, which earned him both friends and enemies.

He left the school when he was 17, and eventually made his way back to [[Pasona]] and went back to working with Qira. One night a few months later, he was outside and saw something crash to the ground. His curiosity got the better of him and he went to see what it was. What he saw was a small dragon that was the color of amethyst. It was injured and, over the next month, he took care of it, though the relationship was a bit rocky at first. He named the dragon [[Aegon]]. One day, a couple months later when he was checking on Aegon, a group of well armed and armored people surrounded him and Aegon. Their leader, a Triton man named Ralis Moreno, seemed to recognize Erland's necklace and stepped forward. He asked Erland where he got the necklace, and a wicked look spread across his face at the answer. Ralis said that Erland and the "beast" were coming with him. Naturally, Erland refused to back down and it was at this moment the bond between Erland and Aegon solidified. Erland's eye became more draconic and turned the color of amethyst. He and Aegon attempted to fight them off but there were too many and the hunters had actual combat training. Just as Ralis was about to finish Erland, there was a blast of lightning and a blue dragon with a man riding it landed near the hunters, causing them to flee. The man picked up Erland and patched him up. He noticed Aegon then introduced himself as Jon Mallory, a Dragon Knight. He then told Erland that, due to the bond with the [[drakkon]] (as Jon called Aegon) that Erland had the chance to become a Knight. He looked at Aegon then back at Jon and accepted. The strange group then made their way back to town and was subject to many strange looks and whispers. Erland said his goodbye's, gathered his few belongings and left with Jon.

He stayed and trained with the Dragon Knights until he was 19, and made a couple of friends: a half-elven woman named Calia Amann (who bonded to a silver drakkon) and a human man named Jaiden Thatcher (who bonded to a green drakkon). Together, the three of them traveled as their own Free Brotherhood band. It went well for several months. Unfortunately, it didn't last. The group had met up with another Brotherhood band and were camping with them when Jaiden and his drakkon suddenly attacked both groups without any explanation. He managed to kill the other Knights (with skill both he and his drakkon shouldn't have at this level of training) and wounded Erland and Calia before disappearing. Shortly after, Calia left to join the Moonshell flight as a Flightbound. Erland managed to contact Jon a short time later, and it turned out Jaiden had managed to convince a majority of the other Free Brotherhood Knights (though not all, Jon being one of the main ones that didn't believe Jaiden) that Erland was to blame for the death of those Knights and that Erland was to be exiled and a bounty had been placed on his head. Erland had no choice but to stay on the move and turn to basic mercenary work.

Most of the time, his jobs weren't well paying and, due to his nature as a tiefling and [[Dragon knight|Dragon Knight]], he was rarely well received (which made getting work rather difficult). Some jobs were less legal than others. However, his luck seemed to change when he came across a job for a noble family in [[Mirzapur]], the [[D'Arcy]] family. They needed someone to find their daughter and bring her home. Erland met with them and took the job, though he felt like something was off. It took him a few months, but he was finally able to track down their daughter. Their first meeting actually escalated to a fight (despite her seeing the drakkon, which didn't seem to faze her, much to Erland's surprise), one that, surprisingly to Erland, ended in a stalemate. Once they both calmed down, she ended up giving her side of the story: her parents, her father in particular, effectively kept her prisoner (gilded cage sort of thing) because she's "different" (i.e [[Plane-touched|celestial plane-touched]]) and she was worried what they might end up doing. She decided she'd had enough, ran off and had no desire to go back. Her story resonated with Erland, who knew what it was like to be "different" and he, to her surprise, decided to not take her back. They parted ways and Erland went back to Mirzapur and was brutally honest with Elise's parents when they questioned him on where their daughter was, telling them exactly what he thought about their treatment of her. Unsurprisingly, this didn't go over very well and Erland was then attacked by their guards. During the ensuing fight, Elise appeared and helped Erland and Aegon get away. A short time afterwards, Erland questioned Elise on why she came after him, to which she responded that she knew her parents wouldn't have accepted she wasn't coming back. She also said she felt she owed Erland for not just dragging her back when he could've easily done so. Next thing he knows, she kissed him (fade to black). They stuck together for a couple months before the trouble with Elise's parents caught up to them and forced them to part ways. He then travels with Aegon while doing whatever work he could find to keep himself and Aegon fed. Eventually, he found his way to Surat where he found Fai, Jo'Vasha, and Vijil.

== Personality ==
Sarcastic, reckless, and somewhat arrogant. These are the qualities that Erland presents to the majority of people. But the people he's closer to will see someone who is terrified of his past(his father and the unknowns with that) and the feelings of inadequacy that came from what he considers his "failings." He's also fiercely protective of the people he's close to.

'''Ideals:''' Can't stand bullies, nobility, and people with huge egos. He'll quickly jump to the defense of victims of these types of people (which led to many bruises and broken bones when he was younger).

'''Bonds:''' He'll do whatever he can to keep the people he cares about safe even at the cost of his own health and safety. Despite many in his Order thinking him a traitor, he still considers the Dragon Knights to be his family and wants to find a way to clear his name.

'''Flaws:''' Has a bad habit of rushing in without thinking. He can also be rather greedy and frugal when it comes to money.

      <text bytes="3916" sha1="4umaig3lpuw0ysmh7q3r0lquyurq8p6" xml:space="preserve">A human(?) man(?) with strange body-modification powers. Doesn't remember much of his(?) recent past.

Part of [[Tempus Machina]].

Age: 21-22

'''Backstory''':

Fai had met the party during his early teens. He had been staying with his uncle, Alois, when he had been in the academy for gifted students. After attending the academy for some time, his family had an emergency regarding Reya, his younger sister, who had some physical issues from birth. He had gone back home to be with her. Before he left, he made a promise to the party that he would go adventuring with them when this whole situation was settled.

Before he met the party again, Fai had somehow gained his Protean ability. He has very fragmented memories, to where he mainly remembers brief glimpses of the past. He does remember two distinct things- his promise to meet the party again and Reya calling out to him.

He woke up a couple months before meeting the party, where he travelled on his own. During these travels, he learned of his abilities as a Protean (completely on accident). However, he also found out the hard way that people don’t respond well to his mutations. So he is a bit nervous around people and using his mutations.

'''Goals''': find out what happened to himself and to find Reya

'''Interesting Tidbit''': Fai doesn’t look like the rest of his family. His family is a lot more tan, with dark hair and brown eyes. He has golden eyes, very light tanned skin, and was initially more honey hair, which has now been dyed darker. There were rumors that he may have been an affair child or something. Who knows.

'''Relationships''':

''Father and mother''- he does not remember them, but they may be alive. Or dead. Update: Fai's mother and father are (in the current timeline) alive. Due to memory shenanigans, his mother had been forced to forget him (and Reya).

Reya- younger sister, who is about 18. Fai briefly remembers some memories of her and the two were very close. Most of his memories involved her being in bedrest or using a cane to walk. Fai wants to find her. Update: She's living in a school for those with aether sickness.

Alois- his uncle who worked at the school and was an ex-military agent. Fai wanted to initially join the military and make a name for himself, so he was sent to school at the academy with Alois as his mentor. Update: Alois is alive, but corrupted by the Adversary. Currently living in the village of [[Makari]] near [[Charn]].

Fai was sort of the second priority of the family due to Reya’s condition. Reya’s condition could go from good days [able to move around with a cane] to bad days [complete bed rest, needs constant care]. For this reason, Fai’s family spent more time taking care of Reya. Fai decided to go to live with his uncle temporarily so he could train to be a knight AND so it is easier on his parents [one less kid to worry about]. As a child, he did have some issues with wanting to be the best/trying to get his parents’ approval due to them favoring Reya. Timeline note: in the current (modified) timeline, Fai's parents had retained their noble status and much of their wealth.

== Seeker and Watcher ==
Fai's mother's family, stretching back to the first humans to settle in [[Soefra]], had become associated with [[Charn]] and its wards. Each generation saw two important figures from the bloodline--the Watcher and the Seeker. The Watcher was always a woman, chosen to keep the book of records and the memory of [[Charn]] (and their connection to it) alive. Each Watcher selected and trained the next Watcher. The Seekers were sent, in company of the previous Seeker (now called the Guide) to [[Charn]] to re-establish the link to the outer warding layer.

Fai is the last Seeker; it was during this trip with Alois (the previous seeker, now the Guide) that the [[Reweaving]] occurred (due to a breach in the outer wards).

      <text bytes="4076" sha1="49v4xcq4qshznbgwf89ndnd6h3p1avh" xml:space="preserve">The first and greatest creation of the [[Prehistory|Dreamer]] before the establishment of the planes. They embodied potentialities and concepts. Although to say that they were discrete individuals is...difficult. Each of the primordials was separate and distinct from each other, but the primordials themselves could fragment themselves and be in many places at once, sharing the same consciousness. Although to say that there was "place" and "time" at that point is ''also'' difficult. But that's the closest analog for our limited minds.

== Eight and One ==
There were originally eight-and-one (the number one greater than eight is...ill-omened to this day) primordials The Eight were

* Fire (Energies)
* Earth (Solid matter)
* Air (Gasses)
* Water (Liquids)
* Light (Law, Progress)
* Darkness (Memory, Stability)
* Life (Organization, Creation)
* Death (Destruction, Decay)

And the one, later called [[Nameless]], was Change (Mediation, Disorder, Adaptation).

The four elemental ones, in cooperation with Life, created and organized matter. Death broke down that matter, recycling the unneeded parts down into raw dream-stuff for reuse. Light and Darkness managed to constrain progress with a memory of what worked and what shouldn't change; Change mediated between the others, acting as the grease in the cogs. Overall, the Dreamer watched and dreamed the plan.

== Lesser Concepts ==
The eight-and-one primordials could not do everything, so they petitioned the Dreamer to give life to fragments of themselves, naming them Concepts. Causality, order, vengeance, happiness, peace, discomfort, all these and more were Concepts brought to life by the Dreamer.

Even lesser beings such as elementals and the First Races were created as the Dream progressed, living among the glorious assemblage of matter and energy, all planes mixed into one whole. Each serving a role in creation's design.

== Fall into Conflict ==
For an unknown reason, [[Nameless|Change]] rebelled. He abandoned his role as buffer and lubricant and mediator, desiring to shape the newly-born creation to his whim. The others, of course, rejected this usurpation. There was war in the Dream; Concepts were weaponized; some Broke and became the [[Broken Concept|Broken Concepts]]; others remained intact but diminished. The [[Nameless]], his name and dominion now stripped, warped many of the lesser races into monsters.

Sometime during this conflict, the [[Oblivion Gate]] was torn open, releasing [[jotnar]] into the Dream. This caused the Dreamer to step in, fearing that the anti-life entities would destroy the dream entire. He cast the [[Nameless]] and the [[Broken Concept|Broken Concepts]] into the [[Abyss]] to serve as the plug to contain the gate. The other primordials, wounded and distorted by the conflict, he turned into the planes themselves. The intelligent followers of each "loyal" Primordial were given the choice to join their prince in the newly-formed plane or descend to the Mortal and take on life there. The [[proteans]], the poor cursed followers of the [[Nameless]], as well as all the living weapons created by that entity, were condemned to the Mortal, to live and die there.

Even with this, the primordials retained some semblance of identity, acting as the will of the planes (to some limited degree).

== Cataclysm War's Ending ==
At the [[Battle of Acceptance]], the 8 and 1 were reunited--the [[Nameless]] in the hijacked body of an elven magus, the Eight having been invited in by loyal mortals. There, they all enacted a ritual sacrifice, destroying their hosts and their essences to stabilize reality and allow Change its proper place in reality. Many of the [[Broken Concept|Broken Concepts]] were healed at that point as well.

However, as multi-valued entities, it is unknown whether all fragments of the primordials were destroyed. It is believed by some scholars that [[Wayland Smith]] is actually a pre-Dawn War, loyal fragment of Change itself; if this is the case, there might be others as well.

Most merely cause some splashing; momentary (pun intended) splits that instantly rejoin. If time is a bundle of yarn, knotted and webbed, then most decisions merely fuzz the fibers. But some actions cause divergence. The stream cannot trivially rejoin around the rock, part of it diverted over a cliff (ok, the metaphor is getting out of hand).

== Critical Points ==
Some decisions occur at critical points, where any change is fraught with consequences. These critical points cause splits in the timeline that last more than momentarily. An example of such a critical point was the instability encountered by the [[Phoenix Empire]] upon the occasion of the first regeneration of the [[Eternal Emperor]]. It was touch and go--in one timeline, he survived and was reborn with increased strength but with a need to consolidate, leading to the empire's withdrawal from the [[Great Rift]]. In another, he died, and with him the empire.

Note that timelines, once split, can rejoin later. But that requires another substantial event in one or both timelines.

== Locality ==
Timelines are not universal. The effects of decisions tend not to have huge scope--a "froth" decision might only reach as far as one person's life; no splitting occurs for anyone else, not even for an instant. A significant point may cause divergence across a continental scope (such as the above-mentioned elven empire decision).

== Fixed Points ==
Unlike a critical point, where differences in behavior lead to splits, a fixed point is an event that occurs across a bundle of timelines. The exact details may vary but the core similarity remains. One such event was the [[Cataclysm]] itself; another the ascension of the [[Archon of Time]]. The [[Reweaving]] is another fixed point for the timelines in and around [[Ikela]].

He interacted with the [[Heroes of Pactum]], granting them back-door access to some of the other Reprobis' domains in exchange for access to study [[Walker]], having never seen a [[soul-forged]] before. After the arcane structure was torn down in the events of [[Redeeming the Lost (Campaign)|Redeeming the Lost]], he returned to his former Family as Pe'vel'Malphas.

When asked, he tells people that he is 19, in order to avoid being viewed as a minor. [[Jo'Raani]], his Mother, a [[sher-ka]] woman, and renowned (but mistrusted) wizard who taught at the [[Sea-Song Academy]] in [[Varanasi]]. [[Jo'darsha]], his father, is a [[sher-ka]] merchant specializing in exotic goods such as spices. His father was distant, teaching him only to speak when spoken to, as his hope was to bring the Sher-ka race the respect and honor that it lacks in the region. Together the two made enough gold to own an upper class estate within the Academy District of Varanasi. 

From a young age, he has been kept within his family home by his mother. She was extremely overprotective of him, refusing to allow him outside unless she was with him. She began homeschooling him at 2 years old, teaching him how to read and do basic math. By the time he was 10, she began training him in wizardry. His real passion was in art (specifically drawing), though he lacked the ability to perceive abstract concepts, so his drawing are always extremely realistic portraits and landscapes. It was around this age, that he met his three friends [[Fai]], [[Vijil the Watcher|Vijil]], and [[Erland Nygaard|Erland]]. They would sneak him out (mostly out of pity, or so he believed), to play with them.

At the age of 12, he witnessed the shattering of reality known as the [[Reweaving]] during what seemed to be a dream. Something made him forget most of the event, but what he does remember is the image of a women staring down at him, with eyes that reflect the scene infinitely. After that event, he would spend hours attempting to draw her again. Each image was slightly different (hair style, or color, or nose shape etc.). He was never satisfied, always feeling like something about the picture was off. It was after this time that he dove into his research into the figure, and took his studies as a budding wizard seriously. He learned the figure was the [[Archon of Time]]. Through what he could find on her, he began learning the ways of channeling the magic of time. His eyes turned a deep black, with slowly drifting mist within and giving them incredible depth. 

Five years passed, and as the years went on, he made more attempts at leaving. His mother was extremely abusive. From emotionally stunting him by the constant over-protection, to physical abuse or, as she would say "smacking some sense into him" if his assignments weren't up to her expectations. His attempts included trying to learn how to teleport short distances (misty step as it is called), only for his mother to catch him halfway through his spell scribing. As well as midnight dashes over the estate ground walls and into the streets, only for her to somehow find him within minutes. His escape was finally successful one night when he found a letter, instructing him to head southwest, to a far off town called [[Surat]]. He didn't know who sent the letter, but he believes the mysterious sender found a way to get his mother out for a long enough time for him to steal the misty step spell inscription, and escape his family home. He made his way our of town and down south as quickly as he could, hoping his mother wouldn't find him as he reconnected with his childhood friends and began an incredible journey.

== Personality ==
Timid, with outbursts of strong emotions in times of innocents being in distress. Has a tendency to overthink, leading to him mumbling and rambling quietly. Occasionally enjoys breaking the minds of women with what he has seen or knows, due to his past. 

'''Ideals:''' Will do anything he can to pursue his research into the Archon of time, wishing nothing more than to meet her. Also very attached to his art, having originally wanted to become an artist, if not for his mothers forced teaching of the arcane. 

'''Bonds''' The few friends he met in his childhood (Fai, Vijil, and Erland). Later adding Aegon and, most importantly, The Archon of Time. 

'''Flaws''' Extremely timid around women, often flinching at attempted physical contact between them. Tries to stay as far away as he reasonably can, when in proximity. Abstractions, as well as metaphors, often elude him. Usually takes such things completely literally.

Not very organized, it exists throughout [[Noefra]] in small cells, totaling maybe 50 people. Each cell is usually a knight and his fellow aspirants and maybe an ally or so. A significant number of pact-bound, often who have pacted with [[Redemption]].

Their oath is

* to protect the light from the darkness,
* to take on the sins of the world so that innocents don't falter.
* to train so that when they're condemned to the Waste for their sins, they can fight the demons there on equal terms from the inside and break the doors of Hell. Despite Hell not really being a thing...

== Poem ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am the last tear of the sinner

I am damned; my sins haunt me.

There is no forgiveness for my deeds;

When I die, the demons will appear.

--

I am the tear of the sinner

Shed so that no one else must suffer

The way I did.

--

I am the gloves that wallow in grime

That the hands may remain clean

I am the overcoat, battered by filth

And discarded lest the frock be spoiled.

--

I am the tear of the sinner

And when the demons come to drag me down

I will fight them on their own turf and break open the gates

From within&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not technically part of [[Byssia]], the Company acts as the government, in conjunction with a mayor chosen from the settled folk. It's only current trade routes are with [[Byssia]] proper, so its independence is notional unless another route can be found. Currently Byssia has no interest in administering it, although that might change if the port is developed or becomes a threat to their interests.

== Student Population ==
The Academy houses roughly 150 students at a time, of which generally 50 are drawn from the First and Second Families and the rest are from wealthy merchanter families or scholarship students. The scholarship students are chosen by methods and for reasons known only to the Headmaster, but his track record of picking people who will go on to make waves is...impressive.

== Course of Study ==
Every student takes courses on

* Ikelan and world history
* Races and cultures of the region
* Basics of magic
* Etiquitte
* Religion

But those only occupy a fraction of the time. Most of the curriculum is individualized, with faculty (some in-residence, others visiting) teaching an eclectic array of courses to hand-picked students. Those with magical gifts are trained in their talents; those with martial gifts are trained in combat. There are rumors that those with more...larcenous...gifts have training in such things in a hidden part of the campus. Those without particular talents can take classes in the arts, discourse, politics (in which they may intern with members of the Houses), etc.

A full course of study, terminating upon graduation or expulsion, lasts generally about 4 years, although many students follow shorter courses and some linger for nearly a decade. Graduation comes when the student and advisors decide it's time.

== Campus ==
The campus is a 300 acre collection of buildings, open areas, experimental areas, and even farms located about 1 mile outside the walls of [[Varanasi]] along the Sheo river. Considered a "hard target" for those intent on harm, it is patrolled both by guards loyal to the Headmaster and...stranger things....

Extremely rarely seen by the surface folks of [[Noefra]], they are most common in the outer islands of the southern [[Primal Sea]] and south-western [[Oelfra]]. Small colonies exist elsewhere as part of the sea-borne alliances.

== Physical Appearance ==
Notable for pale blue-green skin, sea-weed green hair, and short stature. Weilgoroesi rarely stand more than 5'2". Their feet and hands are slightly webbed and clawed (more like long nails) and 2" or so fins ride the forearms and lower legs.

== Settlement ==
Random settlements of ikelan and merai folk, alongside natives. Colonization is only significant near the rivers on the north and west boundaries.

== Boundaries ==
Theoretically, it's the area between the Sheo and the bay on the north, the large (unnamed so far) mountain range to the south, the Jalsheo to the west, and the narrow gap between [[Clan Sunud]] and the [[Red Lightning]] flight's territory to the East. In practice, it's whatever happens to be controlled by [[Ikela|Ikelan]] settlers.

== Significant Settlements ==

      <text bytes="4759" sha1="2alxtdiq005na8450gmvl3h6trd2tbd" xml:space="preserve">A [[Dwarves|dwarven]] clan-group living in the mountains to the east of [[Merais]]. While not xenophobic, they do not interact much with outsiders except selected trading companies from [[Fatehpur]].

== Physiology ==
Dwarves of Sunud are physically distinct from most other [[Soefra|Soefran]] [[dwarves]] (although some of the groups living in the central escarpment are similar in skin color). Slightly more slender than most dwarves, their skins are various shades of grey, with most being ashen. Their eyes are dramatically varied, ranging from black orbs without iris, distinct pupil, or white, to all gleaming white except for a bright, glowing gold ring (again without distinct pupil). Their eyes (especially those of the Keepers) are sensitive to light; a Sunud dwarf on the surface is almost always seen with their eyes shaded by clever lenses (if not a full mask). But the biggest single difference is the hair--Sunud dwarves are hairless except for a single patch near the crowns of their head (on the females, males are entirely bald). This patch is generally grown very long and pulled up into a tail. In color, it is almost always very dark (shades of brown into black).

== Society ==
Clan Sunud, over the last 5 generations or so, has split into two factions. The central mountains are home to the Keepers of Silence, the ultra-traditional group that holds to their founding myth (see below). They believe that to show one's face (especially the eyes) is to uncover the soul; to see another's face is to bear the burden of their soul. Thus, their faces (and whole bodies) are kept covered except among closest kin. They wear elaborate masks that (to a fellow clan member) reveal who they are; the masks are constantly being modified to show the "truth". In the security of the clan hold, buried deep under the mountain, they wear half-masks that cover the upper part of the face. All their masks have crystal lenses that allow vision out, but not in, appearing as faceted gemstones from the outside. The Keepers communicate as much as possible via hand signals in an elaborate sign language; only one member of each group (the lowest-ranking one) is permitted to speak to outsiders. The Speaker to the Faceless's robes are dyed red; all the other robes are grey. Their only ornamentation is on their masks. The Keepers are devoutly religious, devoted to [[Korokonolkom]] in his aspect of Lord of Silence and Lord of Runes. Their only contact with the outside is that they permit a few caravans, run by particular individuals (said to be in payment of a debt) to transit through their highest tunnels (avoiding their clan hold) over into the eastern coastal lands and back. Accompanied by a Speaker and a group of silent, robed Keepers, these caravans are the only safe way to leave the [[Great Rift]] to the east.

The breakaway groups, scattered over the northern and southern flanks of the range, have various names for their groups. Rune-children, the Spoken, Hearers of the Word of Mountains, etc. But they're all united in one thing--they reject the isolationist and silent tendencies of the Keepers. They live in small settlements dug into (or built on) the surface of the mountains, rather than deep inside. Often, they go without masks; instead they tattoo their heads in patterns reminiscent of beasts, insects, or other fearsome creatures. They still cover their eyes, but wear primitive-looking garb. Some reject the use of plants (except in beer...), subsisting on meat and wearing clothes of metal and animal hides and fur exclusively. These groups are dominantly hunter-gatherers, although they do work metal and stone. Their other unifying feature is their obsession with the traces of rune-work left by the ancient [[titans]] which litters the caves in that region. There is a widespread belief that if they can learn to master those runes, the "glory days" will return. 

== History...or Myth ==
It is said among the Keepers of Silence that during the early 3rd age, their ancestors were threatened by some force and they pled with [[Korokonolkom]], then Lord of Elemental Earth, for assistance. He answered, giving them power and etching runic words into their souls (which are visible in the eyes, hence the taboo about showing your face) and changing their appearance as a sign of the covenant; in return, the clan fathers promised to become a separate people and protect the runic remnants from the despoiling hands of outsiders.

The current belief among the scholars of [[Fatehpur]] is that the change is much more recent, being only a few hundred years before the [[Cataclysm]] and mostly due to exposure to sources of eldritch energies radiating from rocks under the mountains.

His home, in a gigantic volcano there, is also the site of the [[Congress of Wyrms]].

[[Tson Azur]]'s wedding was the only recorded time in history that he has left [[Oelfra]].

== Location ==
To the east of [[Ikela]], bordered on the east itself by the mountains inhabited by [[Clan Sunud]] and on the south by the [[Ikelan Colony Lands]].

== Cities ==

* [[Merais (City)|Merais City]] is the capital, located in the shallow waters of the bay. A mix of [[kalasaa]], [[ika-ika]], and [[mkhulu]].
* [[Fatehpur]] is the other major city, located near the shore in the central region of the nation. It is known for its friendliness toward arcane magic, something distrusted in [[Ikela]]. Practitioners from [[Ikela]] often move to [[Fatehpur]] due to persecution.

== Government ==
Merais is ruled by a coalition of [[mkhulu]] adepts, although they do not practice the abhorrent behaviors of many of their cousins. Overall, Merais is a magic-centered technocracy. The Coalition of Adepts confers with the heads of various magical organizations as well as merchant leaders.

== Politics ==
Merais is neutral ground. It does not interfere or wish to expand, but will resist interference with overwhelming force.

== Summary ==
[[Coldwind|Lady Coldwind]]'s family had been murdered (before campaign start) and her brother had disappeared. The party returned to her former home, finding it turned into a nest of [[Barbed Circle]] cultists. They slew the cultists, rescued her brother (who had tried to deal with it, but had been captured) and found tons of cash the cult had squirreled away.

Connections:

* Iraj Mirza (Theodor's great-grandfather) was brother to Tobie Mirza, who was the grandfather of the current head of the [[Ikel]] family (ie King Mazyar Ikel).
* Lessa D'Arcy was the daughter of Charles Varana (of the [[Varana]] line), who was brother to Har Varana, whose daughter Kria was the grandmother of King Mazyar Ikel.

They take great pride in these connections, but the First Families don't consider them significantly connected at all (which is a source of bitterness).

Joined the coastal defense militia/guard once out of school at 18. Spent a few years doing the usual on ships, islands, occasional skirmishes with smugglers and monsters.  Became a scout/spy due to a certain natural talent for it.  Came up river and met old friends from school based on a recommendation to my superiors by my mentor, [[Nestorius|Nestorious]] ...

Married Jenna (who he helped rescue from an alternate timeline) and became Lord of Morton's Thumb and booze dealer.

== Personality ==
I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy. I now always have a plan for what to do when things go wrong.

'''Ideals:''' People. I’m loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care.

'''Bonds''': Someone I loved died because of a mistake I made - I trusted a fool. That will never happen again.

'''Flaw:''' I sat silent while someone was tried and imprisoned for something I know he did not do. My silence was my form of payback for the decision they made that got a friend  of ours killed, and me badly injured, during a scouting  mission...even though I also made a judgment error, I blamed him.

== Koans ==
Vijil is known for his cryptic pronouncements relating to their adventures.

* How far into a song will you go to bring back a concept?
* If an evil one betrays evil allies, is that a good or a double evil?
* When you give someone named Mordred their parole, how long will it be before they turn foul again?
* When the verdict is known before the court convenes, must the kangaroo leap to conclusions, or simply laugh?
* ''If you can become immortal, should you?''
* ''If it has a face that only a mother of monsters could love, can you kill it?''
* When opposing chaotic corruption with an army of monsters, how does one tell the difference?
* ''When tempus machina rush in where angels fear to tread,  are they fools or heroes?'' (Editor: Yes).
* ''By destroying despair, what happens to hope, the other side of the eternal coin?''
*"If you fight with yourself and win, is that victory or defeat?"  
*Does doing the dirty deed define a deal with a devil?
*If you kill the evil shadow of a loved one, should you tell them how it made you feel?
*If a fiend offers to help deal against the ultimate being of destructive chaos, should you accept his offer?
*The druids' wildwood weed: must one fly to get high, or must one get high to fly? 
*Is it more important to know where you are or when you are?
*"If the only thing we have to fear is fear itself, and dragons, when is the right time to be afraid?"
*If fiends' mortal agents are allowed to act, how can fiends be foiled?
*How much reflection is needed for a Watcher to watch the Watchers? 
*When the wytch storm comes, where's your refuge when magic is your essence?
*If you give a dragon an egg, when should you give her bacon?   
*When a birth evokes prophecy, how do you discern its true meaning?
*If celestials, fiends and deities toy with mortals, should mortals speak out or submit to manipulation?
*If you hate what you have become, are you noble?

      <text bytes="2790" sha1="r0qgxdxit8b8gbjxhctq25htb9fzph4" xml:space="preserve">[[Ikela]] is not particularly religious of a country. That said, there are several notable organized religious groups in the area.

== Congregation, United ==
The largest and most "socially approved" (especially among the First and Second Families) organization is the Church of the Congregation, United. Headed by Patriarch Samael [[Ikel]] (brother to King Mazayar [[Ikel]]), it serves all 16 of the [[Congregation]] equally, not favoring any particular one. Each major city has a branch, headed by an Exarch (usually a member of the ruling First Family or a close relative). Smaller towns and villages may have churches headed by a priest or priestess, but they're most concentrated in the larger settlements. The CCU preaches tolerance, respect, and the divinely-granted right to rule of the current noble families. Some accuse the church of being mostly a venue for bribes and a cover for the nobles to do whatever they want.

Founded soon after the [[Ikela History|restoration of Ikela]] in 100 AC.

== Stormqueen's Wake ==
The other major group is called Stormqueen's Wake. Much newer, but growing fast, it was established in 218 AC. While it worships the [[Congregation]], it is most devoted to [[Tatsuryuu]], calling her the "Stormqueen". Its doctrine is one of liberation from "sin", resistance to oppression, and fairness to your fellows. Opponents call it "radical" and "insurrectionist", claiming that the "spiritual liberation" espoused by the overt side is a front for a more radical leveling of society and destruction of the current order desired by covert factions within the organization.

Unlike the CUU, SW has no official leadership. Each Servant (the title for those called to the ministry) acts independently, although they meet periodically for alignment.

SW is quite popular with the urban poor, with some reach beyond the urban areas. Its support is most concentrated near the coast; Calabar has the least support.

== Listeners ==
The Listeners are a group of primal practitioners who advocate for and work to appease the [[kami]] and other spiritual entities. They are strongest in [[Surat]] and among the rural poor, but have groups in most areas. They oppose industrialization, colonization, and generally expansion of mortals' incursions on the natural world.

== Other Groups ==

* [[Demon]] cults are extremely rare and are crushed as soon as they are discovered.
* Rumors of cults devoted to several of the [[Diabolical Families]]. This worship, unlike demon worship, is tolerated officially, but not welcomed in the public sphere.
* Several cults devoted to dragons (including, for some perverse reason, [[Kozhun|the Dragon Tyrant]] himself) exist, mostly in the north and in the very rural areas near [[Jaora]].

No one's quite sure where he came from or how he got to where he is, but it's well known that he has sources of information that most lack. He often travels around in disguise, looking for promising individuals to become pupils at his academy. He retains his place despite not being directly tied to any of the Families for reasons that are hinted to mostly involve massive quantities of blackmail.

== Allies ==
He's known to be allied with and highly respected by

* The Order of the Watchers
* The Weirdling Assembly of [[Merais]]
* The [[Moonshell Dragon Flight|Moonshell Flight]]
* and even [[Clan Sunud]]
* King [[Ikel]] XIV.

== Enemies ==
Most of the First Families, especially the [[Mirza]] family.

      <text bytes="6367" sha1="bd7c4khbs35q00zfsxdo7bcvzgedvyb" xml:space="preserve">City of the Sages, the second largest city in the nation of [[Merais]]. Known to house the largest collection of arcanists, magical technologists, researchers, and outright cranks in the [[Great Rift]]. "Ruled" by the [[Weirdling Assembly]], a collection of such individuals; this rule has a very light touch. Not a safe city by any means, but a city of opportunity.
[[File:Fatehpur.png|thumb]]

== Demographics ==

* Roughly 13,000 individuals.
* Mostly humans, but with a leavening of [[kalasaa]], a significant number of rebel [[sena'ka]], and some of the only [[gwerin]] known to live north of [[Two Moons]] and the [[Phoenix Empire]].

== Economics ==
Knowledge is power. ''Arcane'' knowledge is ''real'' power. Those without either are servants, seekers, or experimental victims...cough...subjects.

== Departments ==
The primary "political" divisions among the Fatehans (the demonym for residents and citizens of Fatehpur) are the Departments. Named semi-jocularly after branches of a university, they represent approaches to power and specialties. Being a member of a Department (which about 60% of the citizenry are) grants both resources and protection, but the cost is that your vote is [[Weirdling Assembly|delegated]] to the head of the Department and you can't revoke it without serious drama (and usually switching Departments). This is considered a small loss for the notoriously administration-averse mages. In decreasing order of size and power, the Departments are

# Information Sciences (specializing in divination, illusion, as well as being the home of chronomantic magic), headed by Hieronimous sur Golai (goes by Hiero), a [[gwerin]] archmage of uncertain origin (or at least he's not talking about where he came from about 10 years ago)
# Life Sciences (specializing in biological magic and transformations), headed by Brinmar sur Pelam, another [[gwerin]] archmage and ex-wife(ish, it's complicated) of Hiero. The two are neck and neck and frequently feuding.
# Physical Sciences (specializing in elemental magic), headed by Raila (no last name), a human woman born to a noble family in [[Ikela]]. She's only a Master mage, but easily the most personally popular of the top 4.
# Psychology (specializing in mind magic, psionics, mind control, etc), headed by Mind-Seeker (not his real name, but what he goes by), a [[mkhulu]] archmage and psion. By some accounts he's the most personally powerful individual in the city, but rarely leaves his domed complex on the north side of the city. Psychology is home to most of the [[mkhulu]], [[sena'ka]], and [[kalasaa]] citizens. Mind-Seeker's right-tentacle-mage, Master Kfthis, is the one who represents those votes on the Assembly.
# Divinity (specializing in the study of both the gods, ascendants, and other residents of the Astral), headed by Master Apsalan, a human mage. Divinity is also home to most of the non-arcanely-powered citizens, who chafe at being second-class citizens (literally).
# Alchemistry (specializing in, well, alchemy), headed by Master Pthai, a rare [[zandolit]] mage.
# Labor Relations (specializing in the study of summoning, binding, and necromancy, as well as dabbling in mind-control a little bit), headed by Boss Hogg, a master mage and [[sena'ka]] exile from the Fleet. Very not popular. Own many of the "Property"-class people in the city.
# General Studies (specializing in, well, not specializing), headed by Adept Solon, a human woman. GS claims to speak "for the common citizen" and seeks to better their life. Newly started.

== Wytch Storms ==
One phenomenon in Fatehpur and the eastern [[Ikelan Colony Lands]] is the Wytch Storm. This is a combination of a regular wind/rain/lightning storm and a magical disturbance. They emanate at random from an area of jungle roughly 100 miles south of the city proper, in the [[Stormveil Jungle]], a particularly dangerous and dense jungled area. This magical disturbance disrupts sensitive magical experiments (at weakest) and may disrupt all active magic, causing spells to fail or backfire. The city is warded against the worst of the effects by the efforts of the Stormwards, a group of mages belonging to Physical Sciences. Travelers to Fatehpur should be aware of the warning flag system, however. The towers of Physical Science may fly colored flags warning of incoming storms (as predicted by Information Sciences). These flags are (in order of increasing severity):

* No flag: normal conditions
* Green flags: Minor storm. Those participating in sensitive ongoing experiments should take precautions to prevent contaminated results. Active spellcasting outside of the ward zone may induce unintended harmless (mostly) sensory effects.
* Yellow flags: Storm Warning. Sensitive experiments should be paused and protected. Unnecessary spellcasting outside of the ward zone should cease and necessary casting should be done only by those trained in storm-time casting. Unpredictable results may occur ranging from minor sensory effects to completely different results than normal.
* Red flags. Seek Shelter. All citizens and Property are advised to seek shelter in a designated Wytch Storm Shelter. Stormwards are on full alert. Once the storm strikes, no access through the ward line is allowed. No spellcasting should be performed outside the most strongly-warded areas, and even then precautions must be taken. Those exposed to the storm may experience substantial unwanted effects, including death.
* Black flags. No Casting Allowed. Under no conditions should you cast a spell. The effects are...unpredictable but always bad. CF the large crater down the SW road--that was someone casting a cantrip during the last Black Flag storm.

In the last year, only 3 storms have reached Yellow Flag status; in the last two decades, there has only been one Red Flag storm. Green Flag storms are fairly common (monthly or more).

The storms get more frequent, more powerful as you travel south toward the Stormveil. There are reports of null storms, where any organized magic simply stops working until the storm passes. Travelers through the Eastern Gap are encouraged to stick close to the Sunud range and move through the gap as quickly as possible. If caught outside during a storm, take shelter underground if possible and watch out for weirdling beasts seeking prey.

They claim a lot of prestige from having voluntarily ceded the throne to the [[Ikel]] family at the reorganization of [[Ikela]] after the death of [[Kozhun]] in 97 AC.

The First Family of [[Jaora]] in [[Ikela]].

== Membership ==

* [[Rajai Jala]]. (50 m). Head of the family. Twin to [[Alana Narbrook]]. Made his name fighting the [[Ship Folk]] during the invasion.
* (Spouse) [[Karena Calabai]] (48 F). Daughter of one of the significant Second Families of [[Calabar]].
* [[Jor Jala]] (28 M). Heir. Landholder in his own right, although struggling at that. He and his wife Ashaia [[Dhamatri]] have 6 children and she is expecting their 7th during the early fall of 251 AC. They were betrothed at age 6 and married at age 14.
* [[Ipsan Temple-minder]] (28 M). Identical twin to Jor. Given to the Church of the Congregation, United at age 7, he is the local high priest. He married Pela (of no particular house), a fellow acolyte about 2 years ago and is studiously non-political.
* [[Rajar Jala]] (24 M). A noted "big game hunter". Known for his brusque manner and lack of conventional niceties. Married Essa, a "barbarian" woman from [[Bayannur]] territory; she matches him drink for drink and outrageous behavior for outrageous behavior. Known to have wrestled a bear and won. Both known for having a temper.
* [[Bureaugard Jala]] (22 M). An effeminate fop. Extremely friendly with the [[Narbrook]] family. Rumor has it that he's a good duelist, however.
* [[Irisala Jala]] (14 F). Not actually a daughter of Karena; she was born as the result of a dalliance with a serving girl, who died in childbirth. She has been legitimized since then.

== Others ==

* [[Rajaput Jala]] (72 M). Father of [[Rajai Jala|Rajai]]. Considered senile, but amusing, by the rest of the family.
*Kal Rotha (38 M). Head of the Jala family guard. Widower with no children, not in a hurry to remarry. Called "the Bear" by many for his size and hirsute nature. Known for brutality in breaking up protests or demonstrations.
*Iereth [[Dhamatri]] (62 F). Officially a Dhamatri, but has served (as her mother before her for a few generations) as the family librarian. Sticks strictly to her library in the Majal Jao, which she defends with extreme ferocity. Takes no guff from nobody. Friends with [[Rajaput Jala]] and the former Jala head.

      <text bytes="2925" sha1="6hakqco8w60bdozarc4kj6vnqqxsbxl" xml:space="preserve">A major branch family of the [[Jala]] family and the most wealthy powerful family in [[Jaora]] district. It's said that they could and would take the throne except that the backward, traditional peasants would revolt. They chafe somewhat under the traditionalistic ways common in the district and look to [[Mirzapor]] for inspiration.

== Main Family ==

* Head: Ashgala Norbrook (70 F). Younger sister to [[Rajaput Jala]]. Known to be a grasping, hard woman. Widow, outlived 3 husbands (2 died in the wars with the [[Ship Folk]]). Has several "maids" (all young pretty girls) that are her confidants and bodyguards.
*Pala Norbrook (heir, 45 F). Itching for her turn on the high seat. Married to a local noblewoman, but has 3 children of her own; her wife has 4 of her own, all of them by different male donors. Very infatuated with [[Mirzapor]] culture.
*Jacob Norbrook (42 M). Serious, business minded. Keeps out of politics. Widower, his wife died along with their first child during childbirth. Has not remarried, nor seems interested in doing so.

== Jala Children ==
A significant source of intra-family friction is the presence of all of the ''other'' children of [[Rajaput Jala]] and [[Salira Jala]], assigned to the lower-status family by tradition once a new Jala head took the throne. In many ways, they act as if they are really in charge.

* Sala Mirz'al (52 F). Married Alka Mirz'al (of one of the branch families of the [[Mirza]]). Believes herself (and her children) much too good for this backwater, preferring to live at her husband's estates in [[Mirzapor]]. She was instrumental in arranging the upcoming marriage of [[Elise D'Arcy]] to [[Bureaugard Jala]].
* Iris Narbrook (52 F). Identical twin to Sala. Spinster, she refused further attempts at marriage when her lover (of no particular family) was killed under shady circumstances. She is a historian of stories and legends, especially of the [[Kozhun|Dragon Tyrant's Reign]]. She is at odds with the rest of the family and lives in Old Town.
* Alana Narbrook (50 F). Fraternal twin to [[Rajai Jala]]. She left the family a few decades ago to live, study, and work in [[Fatehpur]] as an arcanist specializing in elemental behavior.
* Elen Narbrook (42 F). Tyrant Queen of the social scene, she knows all the proprieties and expects everyone else to follow them as well. Married to a local second-house noble who is a total wallflower in her much more domineering presence. Very easily offended and scandalized.
* Toral Narbrook (40 M). Plantation owner/manager for the family. Worries mostly about business. Known to be able to talk your ears off about silkworms. Colossal bore.

== Others ==

* Alex of Varan'a (37 M). Mercenary and head of the hired Narbrook guards. Of a notable family in [[Varanasi]], but estranged. Known for being fair but not suffering fools gladly. Commands about 400 standing troops.

      <text bytes="4089" sha1="gvet6gh9oewi7tiynvp6nhocozdun5c" xml:space="preserve">Three main "streams" of fashion: High [[Mirzapor]] fashion, High [[Varanasi]] fashion, and low fashion.

High Mirzapor mode is the "classic" high fashion. Traditional to a fault, it changes only slowly and emphasizes good breeding and status. High Varanasi is the experimental fashion, with trends being born and dying like froth on the sea. Low fashion is the clothing and styles worn by the country folk (nobles and common alike). It emphasizes practicality and changes extremely slowly.

== Fabrics and Materials ==
Mostly cotton and linen, with silk used extensively among the most wealthy. Fur is used only very rarely, and mostly as an accent ([[Ikela]] being a warm, humid climate). Leather is used in low fashion and as protective gear. Exotic materials such as [[spidersilk]] and [[coralweave]] are used in tiny amounts by the very wealthiest. Elastic fibers (sourced from a few types of plants) are known but expensive.

Fasteners and decorations are bone or wood (at the low end) and brass and gold and gemstones at the high end.

== High Mirzapor ==
Attractive men are slender, pale skin, with dark hair and eyes. Tans, calluses, and visible musculature are lower-class markers. Women are hourglass (enforced by corsets and stays), but also pale with dark hair. "Languid" is a term of approval.

'''Male Fashion''': think "Regency England" (aka Jane Austin's era) in cut. Frock coats, tailored shirts, tight breeches and boots. Generally unembroidered and without lace or ruffles. Nobles go armed, mostly with a smallsword (like a cut-down rapier), but this is usually decorative. Hats are worn, but closer to a tricorne (except). Colors are bright, generally being shades of a single color across an outfit. Blues and greens predominate, with reds being seen as a more feminine color.

'''Female Fashion''': Corsets narrow the waist and push up the bust. The upper bodice is cut low, tight and square, exposing much of the upper side of the breast, with puffy shoulders and long, fitted sleeves (often extending to a point on the back of the hand). Breathing is optional. Lace and ruffles are used sparingly. The skirts are voluminous and layered, often with 7-8 layers of petticoats or with hoop skirts. Artificial bustles are added. Colors are pastels, often very pale ones. Reds (well, mostly pinks) show up frequently. But most dresses are cream or other off-whites or very pale pastels. Women wear substantial jewelry, especially necklaces with heavy pendants. Hair is worn up, but no wigs, although jewels are woven through it. Big hair.

== High Varanasi (ca 250 AC) ==
Attractive men are slightly more muscled and fit than High Mirzapor fashion dictates, but still very pale and soft skin. Slightly more forgiving of various hair colors. Attractive women have more natural figures (although slender is a necessity, cf the dresses).

'''Male Fashion''': Similar in cut to High Mirzapor, but with frills, ruffles, and BRIGHT CLASHING COLORS and high-heeled boots. Men wear jewelry, including ear studs and rings. In the highest fashion, trousers tend to be laminated on with large, padded codpieces made of a very different, contrasting color. Seriously, they look ridiculous.

'''Female Fashion:''' Ditch the corsets and bustles and large skirts. Necklines stay low but become V-shaped, but every artifice is made to fit the dress to the skin. Women frequently have to be sewn into their dresses and can barely walk, as the skirts only flare out in the last 6-12 inches (and often have large trains). Bright colors are the norm, as are arm bands and big chonky jewelry.  Hair is worn down (often to the lower back) or pulled back, but not braided. Jeweled ropes tie it back and are woven through it.

== Low Fashion ==
Trousers and tunics, belted at the waist and laced up the front. Not particularly fitted. Formal dresses tend to be simple but follow somewhat similar patterns (without the excesses) of High Mirzapor fashion: full skirts and square necklines. Sleeves only reach the elbow and the dresses generally are worn with only a single petticoat and no corset.</text>

Known for being similar to a rough silk (roughly 19-25 Momme), but naturally waterproof. Unlike silk, its natural color is a reddish color (hence the name). In [[Ikela]], it is produced primarily in the [[Kal'Mer]] region by the [[kalasaa]] and constitutes the major export of that area. It sells for about 15gp per yard (sold in 48" bolts) or 1500 gp per bolt (100 cloth yards). It takes enchantments related to water extremely well.

      <text bytes="2740" sha1="6pzgl73nhzoo6at442t1fcfu7zx50tu" xml:space="preserve">One of the most expensive fabrics, this is literally the product of spider webbing. It comes in two forms and is a signature material of [[gwerin]] cultures across the globe, as the magic and alchemy required to create it was created by them and it requires the intense training that only those long-lived, arcanely-inclined people can easily spare.

== Giant Spidersilk ==
This is produced by inducing domesticated giant spiders (intermediate between the horrors faced by adventurers and normal spiders), about the size of a large cat or small dog, to spin cocoons around animals. The cocoons are then unspun and the thread treated by magic and alchemy. Stronger and lighter than regular silk, this silk shimmers with an unmistakable iridescence. It costs between 4 and 10 times that of regular silk (40-150 gp/linear yard or 4000 - 15000 gp/bolt) and is most commonly produced by the [[gwerin]] of [[Crisial Kingdom]] in [[Noefra]]. This is the spider-silk most commonly thought of. In [[Ikela]], giant spidersilk is produced near [[Fatehpur]] and imported at a significant expense.

== "Sung" Spidersilk ==
Much harder and more laborious to produce, "sung" spider silk is woven in situ by regular-size spiders specially bred for this. This requires the constant attention of a team of skilled spider-singers, who sing magically-enhanced songs to guide the spiders, often for several weeks straight (taking turns). The resulting bolts are then treated via alchemy and more magic, producing a vanishingly diaphanous fabric of surpassing beauty. Unlike regular cloth, this cannot be dyed--the patterns arise naturally from the magic and processing and vary from bolt to bolt and from season to season. A single mistaken note can destroy an entire season's work--each team generally produces only half of a bolt of the fine-woven variety or a couple bolts of the loose-woven in a season.

'''Loose-woven''' sung spidersilk is the cheaper variety, being effectively lace (albeit in a very tiny pattern). The patterns are irregular, like spiderwebs. This is most often used for over-dresses and scarves or other accents. It costs between 400 and 800 gp per yard (40000 to 80000 gold per bolt), being more expensive per pound than saffron or platinum.

'''Tight-woven''' sung spidersilk is opaque...albeit barely. It costs between 800 and 1600 gp per yard. A single bolt was the tribute given to the [[Ikel]] family on the ascension of the current king by the [[Varana]] family and represented roughly a year's revenue of that family.

In [[Ikela]], all sung spider-silk is imported from [[Two Moons]] via [[Merais]] and the import and tailoring of spidersilk is a tightly guarded secret of the [[Varana]] family.

A 50-year-old human male, he commanded a marine brigade in the war against the [[Ship Folk]] and still leans heavily on his military background. A staunch conservative, he distrusts new-fangled fashions and commerce and supports vigorous foreign policy. He distrusts and dislikes arcane spellcasters more than most Ikelans, because he considers his sister, Alana Norbrook, as having betrayed the country and (more importantly) the family by decamping to [[Fatehpur]] to study wizardry. He recognizes that disliking all practitioners of a tradition for the acts of one (that weren't even ''evil'', just ''annoying'') is irrational, but still indulges it.

He is married to [[Karena Calabai]], although he has been occasionally unfaithful, their marriage is still amicable and his only illegitimate child ([[Irisala Jala]], age 14, daughter of a serving girl) has been legitimized and is one of their favorites.

Raised in an extremely sheltered, controlling environment (although with significant privilege), she factors into [[Erland Nygaard]]'s backstory significantly. She is a storm sorcerer--she believes that she is blessed by [[Tatsuryuu]]. An avid member of Stormqueen's Wake and a secret member of the more radical action branch, she strongly dislikes nobles and nobility, despite benefiting from being one. As of 21 Summer Dawning 251 AC, she is married to [[Bureaugard Jala]] (although that's a sham on both sides).

== Physical Description ==
19 years old, she stands 5'8" tall. Her "tell" is that her hair moves and crackles as if in the wind. She considers that inconvenient, as she's constantly surrounded by static electricity. With violet eyes and dark hair, she is considered quite attractive, if in an unconventional fashion.

It executed its directives, but exerted no influence on proceedings otherwise. With the near-disaster of the [[planar realignment]] and the demise/depowering of the [[Old Gods]] that flowed from that event, the Mechanism recognized that its current state was unsustainable. It needed an interface to make critical decisions and allow information about its internal state to flow outward to those that would be called to replace the past deities. It needed a Voice. It chose the [[Golden Aspects]], as the most neutral and least personal of the [[Old Gods]], to be absorbed into itself. They became the Voice. How much will they retain is unclear. The Voice does not speak to mortals directly--it only manifests within the center chamber of the Core at the heart of the [[Celestial City]], which is only accessible to the [[Congregation]] itself. Generally, its will is transmitted by the Voice to [[Ytra]], who acts as its arm in disciplining the other [[Astral]] beings. It is unclear even how much it speaks. The only ''known'' command was the institution of the [[Congregation|Laws of Divinity]].

      <text bytes="3714" sha1="3bxvcgm410cj6q7rl9zeteh6d2n8kde" xml:space="preserve">The "ruling" "council" of [[Fatehpur]]. Scare quotes intentional. It consists of the 50 people who have the most votes delegated to them by citizens. Its main function is settling disputes and creating general laws (but only a few). The leader of the council (the person with the most delegated votes) is also the nominal Head of Security.

== Vote Delegation ==
Every citizen has a number of votes based on his rank. But since most citizens are way too busy to vote on every matter, they delegate their votes to someone else of their choosing. In principle, this is a free choice, but in practice it ends up being a patron/client relationship (like ancient Rome). Except that there is a pyramid--each person tends to delegate their ranks to someone of the next level up, who in turn delegates their votes (and all the votes that were delegated to them) further up the chain. But not all of them. And not all the way up--those of Master rank or above tend to only delegate votes out of disinterest, not necessity. In exchange for someone's votes, the patron promises to support the client in disputes. Vote delegation is revokable, and revocation campaigns are a common dirty trick. 

== Current Leadership ==
The current Head of Assembly is Hieronimous sur Golai, the [[gwerin]] archmage head of Information Sciences (see [[Fatehpur]]). Close behind him is his (semi-estranged) wife Brinmar sur Pelam, archmage and head of Life Sciences. The third archmage of the city, Mind-Seeker, refuses to become a patron and so is not part of the assembly. But his right-hand...person...the [[mkhulu]] Master Kfthis, is the third point of the triad. Together, the three of them make up a significant majority of all votes and can push through most resolutions. If they agree, which they rarely do. Especially Brinmar and Hiero.

Yes, this is discriminatory. And note that all together, that only makes up ~70% of the population. The rest have the appellation "Property". And have no voting rights and must be overseen by a citizen, who is responsible for their acts and has (nearly) unlimited power over them. They're not ''slaves'', but close. Acolytes are not voting citizens, but have all the other rights of citizens.

For people with powers that don't neatly fit the mold, the examiners (at the docks and land entrances to the city) judge based on the displayed power, assigning it an equivalency-rating. At any time a person can challenge for higher rank. If they fail, they ''lose'' a rank. But that's rare.

      <text bytes="12058" sha1="4u9zdsj9iejf6yzwtbamhkmuayn4dtk" xml:space="preserve">== Basics ==
The rules for crafting items from Xanathar's Guide to Everything are in play.

Non-magical items (and healing potions) can be made during resting hours as long as that makes sense--things that involve very detailed or complex manipulations or that require significant stationary tools (ie refining metals) may only be able to be done during stationary downtime with a properly-equipped crafting area. Value accumulates normally. Note that a work week on [[Quartus]] is 6 days, so a standard healing potion takes 3 work days (24 total work hours), which can be split across several days. Which exact tool proficiency is needed is somewhat flexible, but is bound by the fiction. No using leatherworker's tools to build a house.

Custom non-magical items require a check-in with the GM ahead of time (just as with any custom item).

Potions of healing are not considered magic items. Regular ones can be bought in limited quantities anywhere--larger, adventuring-focused shops may have (almost) unlimited quantities. Higher-grade ones require access to a [[Registered Companies|Registered Company]] most of the time, as they're the primary customers.

== Magic Items ==
Generally, bits of monsters and things found along the way can be incorporated into magic items as the "special component". However, access to the formula is the major sticking point. Formulae can be found/accessed

* During adventures, in forgotten tomes or as rewards
* Certain master crafters may have access to certain formulae. This represents commissioning an item from them, and doesn't require normal downtime (but does require more money, a component and coming back later)
* Very rarely, formulae can be discovered directly by players.

Availability of formulae varies by region.

Spell scrolls do not need formulae (cf Xanathar's Guide), but rarely can be purchased (except in [[Crisial City]]). Mostly, people make and sell ''spell stones'' (which function for all purposes like spell scrolls, except that anyone can use one and they cannot be scribed into a spell book). Generally only spells of levels 1-2 are available in non-specialized shops, and even then only some such spells. Players can make them using the same rules as spell scrolls, although you can substitute Jeweler's Kit proficiency for Arcana proficiency.

=== Magic Item Formulae in the Federated Nations region ===
The following items are known to be commisionable from master craftsmen in areas noted.

* Adamantine Armor: [[Shinevog]] and [[Fuar Uulan]]. : Component: half the weight of the armor in refined adamantine (twice the weight in ore). Cost: armor cost + 500 gp. 
* Candle of the Deep: [[Rauviz City]], [[Crisial City]], and [[Byss]] : Component: a sapphire or ruby worth at least 50 gp, bathed in both magical water and fire (such as the remains of an elemental). Cost: 50 gp.
* Enduring Spellbook: [[Crisial City]]: Component: leather from a magical beast/monstrosity. Cost: normal book cost + 50 gp.
* Ersatz Eye: [[Rauviz]]: Component: a clear glass orb, blessed by either a kami or a priest of 3rd rank or above. Cost: 50 gp.
* Instrument of Scribing: Most major cities. : Component: ink from a giant squid. Can be purchased, but is costly. Cost (not counting component): 25 gp.
* Mithral armor: Most major cities other than [[Byss]]: Component: half the weight of the armor in refined mithral (the full weight in ore). Cost: armor cost + 500 gp.
* Moon-touched Sword: [[Byss]], [[Crisial City]], [[Fort Hope]]. Component: the blessing of a kami-priest of 3rd rank or above. Cost: weapon cost + 150 gp.
* Orb of Direction: Any major city. Component: earth-attuned iron (sliver). Cost: 30 gp. 
* Potion of Water Breathing: Any major city. Component: air-touched water. Cost: 50 gp.
* Veteran's Cane: [[Lyodnoir]] and [[Zhapai Karmap]]. Cost: 150 gp.

== Materials ==
Only a tiny fraction of all the materials that might be used to make or enhance items can be listed here. Each category contains a statement of general use, as well as some common materials, rare/magical materials, and legendary materials.

=== Structural Metals ===
Structural metals are those used to make up large, load-bearing portions of items. They tend to be chosen for strength and ease of use, as well as lightness. The more exotic materials, especially for armor, influence resistance to impact/damage, but mostly ease of wear and weight.
{| class="wikitable"
|+Structural Metals
!Name
!Rarity
!Appearance
!Properties
|-
|Iron/Steel
|Common
|Light grey
|Ordinary steel. Iron, as such, is rarely used for most adventuring items other than pots and pans.
|-
|Bronze
|Common
|Varies, but mostly red-brown
|Similar to iron. Harder to work, but slightly more corrosion resistant. More expensive outside of [[Tlalocana]]
|-
|Rune-steel
|Uncommon
|Like steel, but darker and matte
|Dwarven-made special steel. Does not rust. Harder and stronger than regular steel, but not as hard or strong as adamantine. Mid-way between steel and adamantine in weight. Much harder to work than steel or bronze unless you have the dwarven secrets
|-
|Mithral
|Uncommon/Magical
|Silvery, iridescent sheen
|Extremely light and flexible. Strong for its weight, but not quite as strong as rune-steel. Requires magical assistance to work. Due to its flexibility, it does not make metal-on-metal noises or jingle, acting more like cloth.
|-
|Adamantine
|Uncommon/Magical
|Dark, nearly black. Matte.
|Heavy and extremely durable. Requires significant magical assistance to work, as it does not soften naturally when heated to any temperature below its melting point. Absorbs impact, making effective armor. When used in weapons or tools, those items are especially effective at breaking down objects.
|-
|Water-steel
|Uncommon
|Blue-grey, appears to have waves in its surface
|Forged in magical foundries under the sea by the [[kalasaa]]. Very light, but not as strong as regular steel. Immune to rust.
|-
|Aelf-steel
|Legendary
|White, as if lacquered. 
|Said to have been produced by the ancient aelvar. Key to their towering, "impossible" structures. Said to have been lighter than mithral but stronger than adamantine and immune to most impacts. Some legends say it was grown, rather than forged or cast. Said to have been an excellent substrate for spell work.
|-
|Aether-steel
|Rare/Magical
|Varies, usually bronze or golden. Always has glittering flecks embedded throughout.
|A signature of construction in the Astral plane, as it is used in all the major works (including the arms of the [[Great Mechanism]] and the [[Celestial City]]) as well as most astral-origin equipment. It can also be produced on Quartus, although the secret is lost. Impervious to corruption/rust, lighter and stronger than steel, it also makes a great conductor of astral-aspected anima.

=== Decorative Metals ===
These metals are used for non-structural parts of items, or for items that are not load bearing directly. Often as ornamentation or part of enchantments.

=== Crystals and Gems ===
All crystals and gems (including organic ones such as pearls) serve as reservoirs of strongly-aspected aether. In most, the stored aether is bound up in the crystalline structure; releasing it destroys the gem (converting it into inert dust). However, they can be used to attune other aether to the aspect that they represent without destroying the gemstone. This is the primary magical use of gemstones, and why gems form components in so many spells.

=== Fibers ===
Used to make cloth-based components. Some of these are animal products, others from plants. The rarer and more magical of them require alchemical and/or explicitly magical steps in their creation process.

=== Beast Parts ===
Bits of magically-attuned creatures can be used during the crafting of items. In general, with the exception of scales and skins, these components are used as reagents, transferring some part of the magical nature of the beast (or an analog) to the item, rather than being used directly as part of the final product.

== Monster Bits (WIP) ==
'''NOTE''': these are preliminary thoughts. Not intended as a final.

Each monster has a quality, drawn from the list below. They also have a drop quantity, based on their CR (tier^2?). Each quality can be transferred (if you have enough of it, depending on rarity) to an item during or after crafting. Each one has a rank (does more per rank). Humanoids, giants, and humanoid-appearing monstrosities generally do not have qualities.

Veneration varies from full-on worship to considering their stories to be valuable lessons. The exact number of paragons also varies, but there are a few consistent members of this pseudo-pantheon. Each one is taken to symbolize a key virtue.

== Paragons consistently numbered as such ==

* Khaidai Fuar -- One of the more historically-attested paragons, she led the newly-formed Fuar clan against an invasion of [[goblins]] during the early Third Age (about 2500 years ago). She symbolizes the virtue of Martial Prowess.
* Terbish Truthteller -- A mythic figure supposedly dating back to the Second Age (ca 8k years ago). Supposedly told the [[aelvar]] emperor the truth about one of his schemes (the details vary from telling to telling), knowing that it would get him and his entire clan wiped out. Symbolizes the values of Truth and Honesty.
* Maral Hammerlight -- Another mythic figure with no firm date. Supposedly the first dwarf to discover the art of making [[Items and Crafting|dwarven steel]] after spending 30 days working straight without sleep. Symbolizes the virtue of Industry.
* Bujeg Uulai -- Historically attested, the most recent Paragon. He gave up much of the uulani holdings to accommodate the refugees from the [[Cataclysm]], leading to the present state. Symbolizes the virtue of Charity.
* Runeminder -- The oldest paragon figure, dating supposedly back to the end of the First Age. Preserved the art of writing in the runic script after the creation of the dwarven kind. Symbolizes the virtue of Knowledge.

The region of [[Crisial Kingdom]] east of the [[Windwalker Confederacy]] border and north of the Shaslari Mountains (an extension of the [[Outer Barrier Range]] NE of the [[Sha'slar Autonomous Zone]]).

Named for the major feature, a range of hills that runs along the southern border of the kingdom and through into most of the Confederacy (although its name changes several times). The other two major land features are the Mistyvale Lakes and the Sundown Slough. Both are an anomalously-wet area--the rest of the area is quite dry (not arid, but not wet). But the lakes and slough are boggy moorland dotted with lakes (the largest of the two are the upper and lower Mistyvale themselves).

== Inhabitants ==
The area is dotted with tiny hamlets, mostly human (with some dwarven, goblin, and other inhabitants). The three most significant are (in order of size):

* Honel. The seat of Duke [[Bertram of Honel]], who rules over the entire southern flank of the Kingdom. About 5k inhabitants, a mining town.
* Adair. Seat of Countess [[Anara Badmergh-Shoryu]]. Located about 2 days SE along the Bor's Head River. About 1200 inhabitants. Also mining, but seat of the [[Dwarven Clans|Badmergh]] clan.
* Adlarnis. Tiny village (~500 people) nestled in the Greenwood Valley. Exporters of onyx and agate. Considered rather odd by the other regionals.

      <text bytes="4948" sha1="1uv72hh32fhgcxmt65tedvd6i8oer2w" xml:space="preserve">Giant-kin are the descendants of failed [[Jazuu|giant transformation rituals]]. In a quirk of fate, they are fertile and breed true (mostly, see below about throwbacks) unlike true giants who are sterile. In fact, giant-kin are notoriously fast-breeding. Which most other peoples consider a bad thing, as these oversized humanoids are also known to be hungry and aggressive. At least in Western [[Noefra]]. The [[Oelfra|Oelfran]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have different attitudes.

== Types ==
There are 3 major groupings of giant-kin, with innumerable sub-branches. These are mainly convenience groupings for scholars--the breeds themselves are inter-fertile and only sometimes pay attention to the differences. These main groupings are ogres, trolls, and ettins.

=== Ogres ===
Those who fail out after the first command (or their descendants) "GROW IN STRENGTH, SIZE" become larger than most folks as well as stronger. Generally standing from 9-12 feet tall and weighing between 500 and 700 pounds, these massive chunks of flesh and muscle are the most common of the giant-kin. While not necessarily ''stupid'' (despite the stereotypes), ogres tend to prioritize physical strength and disdain the intellectual pursuits. Throughout most of western Noefra, they are found in small kin-bound bands, working as mercenaries, hired labor, or raiders. While not as genetically hungry as trolls, they still take a lot of food to feed that bulk, which, combined with their cultural disdain for farming, often leads to aggression. Ogre bands are known to keep sheep, in particular, however. Ogre women are just as big, strong, and predisposed to physical solutions as the men are. 

Beware the rare ogres who take up the arcane (only very rarely the primal or the religious arts, for various reasons). Often outcast or semi-outcast by their bands, they are uniformly dangerous.

Ogre bands are most common in the western [[Nocthean Caldera]] and the eastern hills and mountains near the [[Giant Spine Mountains]], at least in known lands. In [[Soefra]], they are common in the southern part of the [[Ikelan Colony Lands]] and down into the Southern Confederacy.

==== Throwbacks (aka half-ogres) ====
The idea that half-ogres are the offspring of humans and ogres is a myth. Instead, so-called half-ogres are ''throwbacks''--individuals for whom the titan transformation didn't entirely stick. So they end up a hybrid of the original [[jazuu]] stock and an ogre. Due to their relative lack of strength (compared to their full-blooded brethren), they tend to gravitate toward more intellectual and tactical/strategic roles. Oddly, this is broadly tolerated. Many bands are led by a half-ogre.

=== Trolls ===
Trolls (or their ancestors) failed before the third step. They have the powerful build of the ogres as well as the long life bestowed by the second step, without the hunger satiation of the third step. Trolls are consumed by hunger. Every growing and regenerating, but constantly insatiably hungry. Some few manage to transmute their hunger into a hunger for immaterial things like knowledge, but most hunger after food and sensation. Conventional trolls live in swamps and forests, especially in the Sundown Bog and the northern parts of the [[Jungle of Fangs]]. They are also common in the western parts of the [[Great Rift]].

Most adventurers know that fire or acid are your friends against the common troll, but there are whispered reports of more exotic troll-kin who can only be truly harmed by other means.

Unlike ogres, trolls are known to be clever thinkers, as long as there's food to be had. Females tend to bear litters of young, but the insatiable hunger of both parents and children leads to high infant mortality. Only few trolls make it to adulthood, and the more civilized tribes intentionally keep their numbers down by one means or another, so as not to denude their habitats. Those tribes that don't are generally wiped out by their neighbors once they start swarming.

=== Ettin ===
The rarest of the giant-kin, these are they who failed after the first BECOME step, but before the next line took hold. They have the long life and size and strength of ogres and trolls, but do not have the insatiable hunger. Instead they are bound to the land. Their failure takes the form of mutations--generally either two heads (the classic ettin) or only a single eye (the so-called cyclops). Standing closer to 16 feet tall, their minds are slightly warped by the runic energies. Those with two heads are prone to bickering among themself, but can learn powerful arts if they agree. Cyclopean ettin are very focused on specific pursuits. In either case, the stereotype of ettins is ''laziness''. Because the step they (or their ancestors) failed was VALUE WORK. Unlike trolls, they are only marginally fertile, and only sometimes breed true. They are found most commonly as individuals or mated pairs, and are not common anywhere.

Rethinking how races (now called "lineages") work for PC construction.

'''Lineage''': The "biological" part. Every lineage specifies

* Size (both category and suggested height/weight bands)
* Age (both age of physical maturity and usual max age)
* Base speed (walking + any others as appropriate)
* Ability Score Increase (+1 to one ability score from the list given, total ASI cannot exceed +2 to any given ability score)
* Status. One of "core", "regional X", "rare", and "X-touched". Core lineages are found everywhere and raise no especial eyebrows. Regional lineages are common/normal in region X, but will raise eyebrows elsewhere. Rare lineages raise eyebrows everywhere. Touched (X) is special--these are more like templates attached to core or regional lineages rather than independent lineages. They may add, change, or modify characteristics of the parent lineage.
* Some combination of features. One ''minor'' feature only counts as half of a ''major'' feature; each lineage has the equivalent of 2 major features.

'''Culture''': The area you come from. In general, any lineage can come from any culture. Restrictions are as noted in each description. Cultures specify

* Region (where they're mostly found)
* Ability Score Increase (+1 to one ability score from the list given, total ASI cannot exceed +2 to any given ability score)
* Extra languages. 1 or more languages other than Common, which every adventurer speaks.
* Proficiencies. 3 total proficiencies (tools, skills, or otherwise).
* Feature. One major-equivalent feature.

'''Background''': As currently, except also pick an ability score to increase by +1 of your choice. Total from lineage, culture, and background can't exceed +2 to any single ability score (so +1/+1/+1 or +2/+1).

== Lineages ==

=== Core Lineages ===
'''Human'''
{{race|asi=+1 Intelligence OR Wisdom|age=adult at 16, lives until 80-ish|size=Medium. 5' - 6'6", 100-300 lbs|speed=30ft.|status=core|feature_1='''Desperate Plea''': As a reaction when you make a d20 test, you can choose to reroll the d20 test and take the second result. If you had advantage or disadvantage, the reroll does as well. You can use this trait a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.|feature_2='''Cultural Mimicry''': Choose any feature granted by a different culture.}}

'''Dwarf'''
{{race|asi=+1 Constitution|age=physically adult at 20, lives until 150-ish|size=Medium. 4' - 5'6", 150-250 lbs|speed=30ft.|status=core|feature_1='''Stone's Endurance''': When you expend a hit die as part of a short rest, you can choose to either remove a level of exhaustion (keeping the rolled healing) or maximize the healing received from that hit die. You can use this feature once per short rest.|feature_2='''Darkvision''': You have darkvision out to 60ft.|feature_3='''Poison Resistance''' You have resistance to poison damage and make Constitution saving throws against being poisoned at advantage.}}

'''Ihmisi''' (aka wood elf)
{{race|asi=+1 Dexterity|age=adult at 20, lives until 120-ish|size=Medium. 5' - 5'9", 80-180 lbs|speed=30ft.|status=core|feature_1='''Voices of the Kami''': While on the mortal plane you can meditate for 1 minute. During that time, your senses (vision and hearing) expand to 100ft (increasing to 200ft starting at level 5, 500ft starting at level 11, and 1000 ft at level 17) regardless of natural obstructions and you can sense the presence and number of any creatures within range. The exact location of "unnatural" creatures (fiends, undead, aberrations, or celestials) are pinpointed and you know their type. In cities or other "worked" environments, the range is halved and only unnatural creatures are sensed. You cannot see through or into buildings or other constructed obstructions. You can use this trait a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.|feature_2='''Trance''': Instead of sleeping during a long rest, you spend the 6 hours of 'sleep' in a semi-conscious state, still able to perceive your environment.|feature_3:'''Mask of the Wild''': You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.}}

'''Orc'''
{{race|asi=+1 Strength|age=physically adult at 12, lives until 70-ish|size=Medium. 5'6" - 7', 150-350 lbs|speed=35ft.|status=core|feature_1='''Red Fang's Legacy''': Once per long rest, you can rage as if you were a level 1 barbarian, except that you can concentrate on spells (but not cast them) while raging in this way. If you have the Rage class feature, you instead can use that feature an additional time per long rest and can concentrate on spells while raging with the feature|feature_2='''Relentless Advance''': Your speed increases by 5ft.|feature_3='''Brutal Critical''': When you critically hit with an attack, instead of rolling the damage dice twice, roll the damage dice for the attack once and add the result to the maximum roll of the dice (ie max + roll). Features that increase the number of critical dice are not maximized.}}

=== Regional Lineages ===
Hobgoblin (Western Noefra)

'''Gwerin''' (aka high elves)
{{race|asi=+1 Intelligence|age=adult around 20, live to 190-200|size=Medium. 5'4" - 6'5", 100-200 lbs|speed=30ft|status=regional (Western Noefra, Southern Soefra)|feature_1='''Legacy of Knowledge''': When you make an ability check involving either Intelligence or Charisma, you can choose to apply double your proficiency bonus instead of whatever level of proficiency (including none at all) would normally apply. You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.|feature_2='''Aetherically Sensitive''': When you make an ability check to disbelieve an illusion or a saving throw to resist an illusion, you do so at advantage.|feature_3='''Trance''': Instead of sleeping, you remain semi-conscious and aware of your surroundings.}}  

'''Halfling'''

On a failure, the target makes attack rolls against you at disadvantage and their attitude increases by one step (hostile -&gt; indifferent -&gt; friendly) for the duration of the interaction. In combat, targets that fail can repeat their saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success. Creatures that succeed on their saving throw or for whom the effect ends cannot be affected by this ability again for 24 hours. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.|feature_2='''Small''': You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.|feature_3='''Diminutive Target''': When you gain cover against an attack from another creature, it counts as 3/4 cover, not half cover.}}

'''Dragonborn, True'''
{{race|asi=+1 Charisma OR Constitution|age=adult around 16, live to 80-ish|size=Small. 5'0" - 6'6", 110-300 lbs|speed=30ft|status=regional (Western Noefra)|feature_1='''Draconic Soul''': Choose either (a) Breath weapon (as in Fizban's), (b) gaining the Draconic Fear racial feat from Xanathar's, or (c) Vestigial Wings, gaining a fly speed of half your walking speed but must land every other turn.|feature_2='''Draconic Ancestry''': Choose a color from the table in [[dragons]] and gain resistance to the related damage type. If you chose the breath weapon, this also sets the damage type, saving throw, and shape of the breath weapon. |feature_3='''Minor Draconic Trait''': Choose either (a) Vestigial Wings--you gain a flight speed equal to half your base speed, but must land every other turn or (b) Armored Hide--your AC is equal to 13 + your Dexterity modifier while not wearing armor.}}

Sher'ka (Great Rift)

Zandolit (Great Rift)

'''Ophidian'''
{{race|asi=+1 Intelligence or Charisma|age=adult around 15, live to 70-ish|size=Medium. 4'9" - 6'0", 90-190 lbs|speed=30ft|status=regional (Jungle of Fangs)|feature_1='''Distracting Charm''': Proficiency bonus per long rest, as a reaction when you are targeted with an attack by someone you can see, the attacker must make a DC 8 + your Charisma modifier + proficiency Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you can force them to change the target of the attack to another creature of your choice within range or choose to make them lose the attack.|feature_2='''Entwining Limbs''': When you successfully grapple a creature, you can make them restrained instead. If you do so, you cannot drag them along with you.|feature_3='''Heat Sense''': You can detect the presence (and pinpoint location) of living creatures within 30ft even through opaque concealment but not total cover. You do not count as able to see them for spells and effects that require sight, but they are not concealed from you and do not count as an unseen attacker.}}

'''Soulforged, Steelborn'''
{{race|asi=+1 Strength|age=null. No soulforged is more than 40 years old, but adulthood is not defined nor is a maximum age known.|size=Medium. Usually 5'6"+, 200-400 lbs|speed=30ft|status=regional (Western Noefra)|feature_1='''Lightning Core''': As a bonus action, you can cause your weapon attacks (including unarmed strikes) to deal an additional 1d4 lightning damage on hit for one minute. You can use this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.|feature_2='''Living Construct''': You are immune to disease and do not require food or air. You do "sleep" normally, however.}}

'''Soulforged, Shrine Guardian'''
{{race|asi=+1 Wisdom|age=null. No soulforged is more than 40 years old, but adulthood is not defined nor is a maximum age known.|size=Medium. Usually 5'0"+, 150-350 lbs|speed=30ft|status=regional (Western Noefra)|feature_1='''Friend of the Kami''': The kami whisper to you about possible threats. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to find hidden creatures. Additionally, if you are not surprised but a creature that can hear you within 30' is, you can spend your reaction at the start of combat to alert them, removing the surprise.|feature_2='''Living Construct''': You are immune to disease and do not require food or air. You do "sleep" normally, however.|feature_3='''Natural Mimicry''': While in natural environments and stationary, you appear indistinguishable from a tree to visual inspection.}}

'''Barbegazi'''

=== Rare Lineages ===
Cysgor

Goror

Gnome

Kalasaa

=== Touched Lineages ===
For all of these, start with a base lineage. The first feature listed for that race (under the boilerplate that everyone gets) is removed and you choose one of those listed for the -touched lineage. For all other purposes, you count as being a member of the base lineage. Some Touched lineages also may change other features; those replace the appropriate feature entirely.

Light-touched (Celestial)
&lt;ul class="bold-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Ability Score Increase''': +1 Charisma instead of the normal lineage ASI.
&lt;li&gt;'''Avenging Wrath''': When you hit with an attack, you can cause a flare of light to erupt, potentially blinding the enemy. The target must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failed save, they take 2d6 radiant damage and are blinded until the end of their next turn. On a success, the target takes half as much damage and is not blinded. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Wings''': As a bonus action, you can cause glowing wings of energy to extend from you, granting you a fly speed equal to your walking speed for one minute. Once you use this trait, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''No End to Duty''': As an action, you can touch a creature and restore hit points equal to 3 times your level. Starting at 5th level, instead of healing someone you can use this trait to cast ''lesser restoration''. Starting at level 9, you can use the trait to cast ''greater restoration'' instead of any other effect. Once you use this trait, you cannot do so again until you finish a long or short rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Fiend-touched (devil)
&lt;ul class="bold-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Ability Score Increase''': +1 Charisma instead of the normal lineage ASI.
&lt;li&gt;'''Hellfire Blast''': When you hit with an attack, you can cause a flare of hellfire to erupt around the target. The target takes 2d6 fire damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failed save, they are frightened of you until the end of your next turn. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Wings''': As a bonus action, you can cause leathery wings to extend from you, granting you a fly speed equal to your walking speed for one minute. Once you use this trait, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Diabolical Sight''': You gain Darkvision with a 60ft range and can see through magical darkness. As an action, you can bestow this sight on an ally within 30' of you for 10 minutes. Once you use this trait to bestow darkvision on another, you cannot do so again until you finish a long or short rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Element-touched
&lt;ul class="bold-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Firelight Flicker''': As an action, you can teleport to an unoccupied location you can see within 30' that is not behind total cover. You can use this trait a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Shielding Stone''': As a reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30' of you is hit by an attack, you can increase the AC of the target by your proficiency bonus against the triggering attack and all other attacks until the end of the current turn. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Rushing Waves''': As an action, one creature within 5' must make a Strength saving throw of a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your choice of Strength or Constitution modifier. On a failed save, they are pushed 10' and knocked prone. On a success, they are only pushed 5'. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;'''Lightning Burst''': As an action, all creatures within 5' must make a Dexterity saving throw with DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your choice of Strength or Constitution or take &lt;proficiency&gt;d8 lightning damage and be unable to take reactions until the start of their next turn. On a success, half damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficency bonus, regaining expended uses when you finish a long rest.

The [[Wyrmhold]] controlled part of the [[Nocthian Caldera]]. It consists of the area east of the Precipice and north of the regions around [[Lake Kyol]]. Borders are approximate.

== Towns ==

* [[Adron's Folly]]: The largest civilian town in the Caldera proper. About 4500 people.
* [[Redcrest]]: Second largest, an up-and-coming town. Stepping off point for ventures to the south.
* [[Old Wyrmhold]]: Not so much the ruins themselves, which are still mostly off limits (although reconstruction has started in the outer fringes). There's a town of about 1200 outside the former walls, mostly a military and scholarly outpost.
* [[Bedni]]: The furthest north large-scale settlement. Named such when settlers realized that the land there was, in a word, poor. There are logging camps in the woods to the north and north east.
* [[Medvyed]]: A tiny village (~500 people) that has the distinction of being the furthest permanent settlement of [[Wyrmhold|Wyrmholder]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in the Caldera. Known for bees, mead, and being a bit...strange.

== Other locations ==

* The [[Frostbound Wall]]: a gigantic fortress spanning the gap leading into the pass out of the Caldera. Finished in 206 AC.
* The Memorial: A garden memorial with walls inscribed with the names of everyone known to have died to the [[Hungering Frost]]; a symbol of [[Wyrmhold]]'s dedication to survival.
* The [[Bulwark (Caldera)|Bulwark]]: A wall/fort guarding the more settled Memorial Valley. Passing through the Bulwark is the official entrance into/out of the Caldera on the [[Wyrmhold]] side.

== Neighbors ==

* Immediately to the west is the Hornet tribe of [[barbegazi]]. Wolf-riders, known to be extremely territorial and stubborn. They do not raid out, generally.
* North of them is the Shrikenest tribe of [[barbegazi]]. Smaller, known as cowards and lickspittles. They suck up to the wyrmholders.
* Further west and encroaching are the Red Ice, of whom not much is known other than that the local tribes are afraid of them.
* The Tuath tribe is across the small range of mountains to the south-west of [[Redcrest]]. They have few dealings with the people of Wyrmhold.

== Ecology ==
In the main, Wyrmhold Reborn is open plains, with scrubby trees. At the northern extreme, the trees become more dense as they approach the feet of the mountains. The ground is relatively fertile, but hasn't been worked in long enough that it's full of rocks. Decent grazing land, however.

The Precipice is a major landform, a cliff ranging from 50' down to ~15' that divides the highlands from the caldera floor and serves as the unofficial border of the wyrmhold-controlled territory. Two significant rivers span it--the Sweet Honey river to the north and the Xhladna (KHLAD-na) that runs down through the Wall and down to [[Lake Kyol]].

== Threats ==

=== Beasts ===
A main constant threat are the mixed warg/wolf packs that live in the forests and mountains and descend to prey on the bison and shaggy wild cattle native to the open lands. And on the smallfolk and their more settled, less dangerous cattle. This is especially bad at the various ends of the area.

Recently (the last couple years), there has been a marked increase in sightings of tunnel worms, large armored centipede-like creatures with digging claws and an acid spit. They burrow underground and come up to take cattle. There is currently a substantial bounty on their acid glands.

=== Other ===
The weather is frequently stormy due to a conflux of fire and air-aspected [[Anima|aether]] in the region. During some storms, lightning elemental creatures leave the Wind Portal (found at the North Sentinel Peak, the high mountain peak north of the [[Bulwark (Caldera)|Bulwark]]) and "play catch" with people down below via throwing lightning bolts at them. This is notoriously hazardous for the mortals.

Dotted around the terrain are buried pre-[[Cataclysm]] Nocthian vaults and remnants of [[Hungering Frost]] fortresses. Most of the ones in the central and southern area have been cleared out (at substantial cost), but they become more frequent as you descend the Precipice into the floor of the Caldera.

== Leadership ==
The area is officially controlled by [[Anu|Clan Anu]] but much of it is still under de facto military control.

* Memorial Valley
* Adron's Folly
* Redcrest
* Bendi--[[Rytsar]] Ivars ka Anu. Hardscrabble local knight, trying to hold things together. 
* Old Wyrmhold--Commander Alexandra vo Gal. Young military commander.

== The First Titan-Wyrm War ==
No one's quite sure why this started. All we know is that the [[Titans]] and the [[Wyrm]] (or large portions of them) fought for a millennium or so. Creation vs destruction--maybe the argument was over aesthetics? No one knows. All that's known is that the [[Titans]] lost, but the [[Wyrm]] did not follow up and destroy their enemies. Maybe they were too battered to continue?

== Fallow Time ==
Between the First War and the Second War was a fallow time, when the survivors regrouped and rebuilt their civilizations.

Near the end of this time, the [[Titan Conclave]] gathered to prepare for what they considered the inevitable resumption of the war (which they denied they had lost), creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. They began work on the [[Orb of All Might]]--the empowering of which created the [[dwarves]] from much of the titan race (those the Conclave considered "lesser").

== The Second Titan-Wyrm War ==
A frantic attempt to stop the completion of the Orb, Titans against Titans, dwarves, aelves, goblins, and wyrm. So not really titan-'''wyrm''', but Titan Conclave vs everyone else. It failed...or succeeded? In the end, the Orb was activated, shattering both [[runic magic]] and [[true sorcery]]. No more would mortals wield the true words of creation directly. In the backlash, titan became [[jazuu]] and [[giant-kin]]; [[wyrm]] became [[dragons]].

      <text bytes="5064" sha1="1aov5hgeu40tul0n4fg23i0gyw2ow7b" xml:space="preserve">The village of Medvyed [med-ved] is the furthest-north permanent settlement in the [[Nocthian Caldera]]. Known for its production of honey and mead, it has a reputation as being a home for "weird folks"--the ones who don't fit in elsewhere. Founded about 15 years ago, it is home to roughly 300 people. About half the population is orcish; another 75-ish [[barbegazi]] of various original tribes, now the Honey-eaters tribe, 50-ish [[jazuu]], mostly of the [[Stonehammer]] clan (now either in exile or estranged from the clan), and a few random others make up the rest.

== Government ==
Officially, Medvyed falls under the authority of Rytsar Ivan ka'Anu, who lives in [[Bedni]], about half a day's trip SE. In practice, it's self-governing. Or maybe ungovernable. The only semblance of local authority is Rita, who everyone considers the town "secretary" and who handles matters of collective concern. While she has no official power, everyone ends up listening to her--it's less trouble that way. Not that she is a tyrant or anything.

== Places of Interest ==
Medveyd subsists on farming, trading with the local goblins (mostly of the [[Shrikenest]] tribe, trading "civilized" goods for forest products and, recently, cash in the form of old coins), and especially the production of honey from local hives, which is used to make the famous local mead at the Badger Brewery.

=== Badger Brewery ===
Attached to the Drunken Badger tavern is the Badger Brewery. The brainchild of Zap, it produces about 2 hogsheads of mead every month, most of which is taken to [[Bedni]] for bottling and sale further on. The sale of this mead produces roughly half the town's yearly income. Known for its sweet, strong, and unique flavor, Badger mead has somewhat of a cult following as far as [[Adron's Folly]].

=== Drunken Badger Tavern and Inn ===
The only public house, eatery, and inn in town, the Drunken Badger is a single-story building with a main taproom and 3 guest bedrooms. It is attached to the Badger Brewery near the banks of the Aphidwine river (ok, overgrown stream) that runs along the north-west border of the village. It's the main unofficial gathering spot for locals. The proprietor is Cormac, a [[jazuu]] male in his late 30s. He and Zap are a couple. Cormac is known for his flamboyant dress, usually wearing dresses and other traditionally women's clothing.

=== Shrine of the Congregation ===
The local house of worship, devoted to all the [[Congregation]] equally, is the shrine. Located on the central market square across from the town hall, it is watched over by the priestess Jess, known for her long speeches.

=== Town Hall ===
A large stone building capable of housing most of the adult population (if they sit on each other's laps, mostly), the town hall is the official gathering place and Rita's workplace. It also houses the town records, which Rita maintains.

=== DD's Blacksmithing ===
A smithing establishment, mostly making farm implements. The proprietor, DD of [[Skem]], has dreams of doing more military work and the training to match.

=== Watchtower ===
Located about half a mile west near the precipice marking the border of [[Wyrmhold Reborn]] and the start of the tribal areas, the watchtower is the brainchild of Peg-Leg and some of the other old war veterans who have settled here. They've roped several of the youngsters into participating as well. It stands about 20' tall and overlooks the gap in the precipice that the Aphidwine runs down through. Not designed for a protracted siege, it maintains a bell and signal fire and the veterans man it 24/8.

== People ==

* Zap Brewer. [[Barbegazi]] male, 25 years old and about 5' tall. Shrewd businessman and much more independent than most goblins. Partner of Cormac.
* Cormac Inkeep. [[Jazuu]] male, 32 years old and about 6'7" tall...and roughly as wide. Extremely muscular. Cheerful and flamboyant. Partner of Zap.
* Jess Priestess. [[Orcs|Orc]] female, about 26 years old. Young for a priestess, it's said she was given this post after her seminary teachers discovered that she can't be shut up once she starts speechifying. Gets very animated about it (what? &lt;u&gt;Everything)&lt;/u&gt; as well. People come to her for blessings and have learned to tune out her ramblings.
* DD (Deidre) of [[Skem]]. [[Orcs|Orc]] female, about 35 years old and about 5'2" tall. '''Hates''' people talking about her height and becomes violent if you do. Some wags have said that her name really refers to other attributes...but only very quietly when she's not around. Known for believing that the best approach is the straightest, most direct one.
* Rita. [[Humans|Human]] female, looks about 17 years old. But has been the secretary here for 5 years and hasn't aged notably at all. Moves as if she's dancing on an unseen wind. Extremely flighty in her personal life (known for missing meals because she got distracted by butterflies; never expect her to be on time for anything) but rock solid in her official capacity.

Other titles: Phoenix Emperor, Immortal Emperor, Mageborn god-king.

Ostensibly the most powerful mage to have ever lived. Born 25 years before [[Moon's Fall]] to the Pwyll family (a minor collateral branch of the [[Aelvar]] imperial family) of [[Aelvar]]. After the fall of the moon and the splitting of [[Soefra]] from [[Noefra]] via the [[Eyes of Qa'desh]], he and his father, Pyderi fab Pwyll, united the scattered, shattered remnants of the empire into the [[Kel'tan]] Empire, named after the mythological entity known as the Phoenix. Once his father passed away (under mysterious circumstances), Hafgan took the Sunfire throne and has ruled ever since.

== Sustained by Magic ==
Until the [[Cataclysm]], Hafgan was sustained by expensive and complex rejuvenation spells (the source of which is unknown). He appeared frequently in public, had many wives and concubines, sired many children. Toward the end of the Third Age, those magics were notably becoming unstable--treatments lasted less and less time before having to be renewed and new treatments were explored. He became less and less frequently in the public eye, and his decrees became more detached (and some would say insane).

The [[Cataclysm]] broke that. No more would the immortality spells work at all. Other means were investigated, the details of which are unknown. But it is known that the price is incredibly high...and that the treatments are no longer effective. The Immortal Phoenix Emperor, one of the oldest living beings on [[Quartus]], is sliding toward death.

== Death at the hands of Gleaner and Adventurers ==
During an audience with [[Tempus Machina]] (ostensibly a trial for their having breached the borders of [[Kel'tan]]), one of his [[Archmagistrate of Kel'tan|Archmagos]] betrayed him and disabled the barriers that surrounded the Palace of the Sun. In the resulting confusion, [[Rune]] entered and engaged the Emperor while the adventurers fought his court and the "loyal" Archmagos. Hafgan was killed, and then all of his clone and substitute bodies were destroyed. The Immortal Emperor is dead...

      <text bytes="3848" sha1="p6ljysm35vkusa57ml137ect54yrweo" xml:space="preserve">The seven most powerful mages of the [[Kel'tan]] Empire, the Archmagosi, form the Archmagistrate. Separate from their clans of birth, they are the real day-to-day power in the Empire. An Archmagos can command almost any lesser [[gwerin]], let alone one of the magebred to do almost anything at any time, and they must obey.

== Dramatis Personae ==
The following appear in order of seniority on the council. This information is mostly public at least at the noble level--6 of the 7 openly wield their power in full view of everyone. The last, the Veiled, is not well known and always appears in costume for official acts and meetings. The other Archmagosi likely know their identity, but have not revealed that publicly.

# Senior Archmagos Un Ynafol [oon EENA-fol] is, second to the Phoenix Emperor himself, the oldest living being in the Empire. Born sometime during the 3rd age, he has used countless clones to avoid death. And it shows. Known to be extremely paranoid, he usually does not appear in person but sends semi-illusionary duplicates of animated ice in his place. His area of focus is on the magical barriers that protect the borders of the Empire. Known to be extremely devotedly loyal to the Emperor.
# Archmagos Gwaedlyd [WAE-did] was born in about 350 BC and is a known practitioner of necromancy and blood magic (by which he sustains himself unnaturally). He is the normal High Judge for matters appealed to the Archmagistrate unless the body decides to take it collectively. Another loyalist.
# Archmagos Shvant [ZVANT] was born in about 150 BC. An ardent clone practitioner, she is a known sybarite with...wide...tastes in partners. As well as taking pleasure in rather extreme forms of recreation (of the bedroom/torture chamber variety). Her area of expertise and focus is on the breeding and control of [[sena'ka]] and [[chaudeekar]] as well as the beast races. Cares for little except her own pleasures. (dead)
# Archmagos Enaid [en-AID] was born in about 100 BC. He also practices the cloning arts. His area of focus is the southern border and the overall military. Loyal to the nation, openly disdains the culture and government. Survives because he has the backing of many powerful individuals and is extremely hard to kill.
# Archmagos Gwydian [GWID-ain] was born in about 2 AC. He is on his first clone body. His area of focus is on the soul and on history. He is one of the most active of the Archmagos in most respects, and has a very strong personal following as a charismatic speaker. Of the Archmagistrate, he is the only one known to be stably life-mated (instead of the contract marriages and concubines most common to major nobles). Publicly espouses total loyalty, but is known to push against the decadence of the current culture.
# Archmagos Bathory [BA-thor-ee] was born about 18 AC. She practices blood magic to stay young; it's whispered that she bathes in the blood of (commoner) virgins. She handles most of the economic matters of consequence. In it for the money, as far as anyone can tell. (dead)
# The Veiled Archmagos is an interesting, mysterious figure. Elevated to the Archmagistrate about 5 years ago after successfully defeating (and killing in the process) the former occupant of the seat when he attacked them. Always appears shrouded in black, impenetrable veils of illusion (and cloth) and uses both magical and mundane means of disguising their voice. Nothing is known (publicly) about their origins, magical specialties (other than that they're powerful enough to shrug aside an Archmagos's full attack and capable of warding themselves against very interested prying), or political leanings. Since their elevation, they have taken an active role in many areas, especially the smaller concerns that normally would not attract the attention of the Archmagosi.

== Events ==

* Delivering the Goods/Politics -- The party is hired to deliver a care package to a noble's mentor in a small village to the south. They discover that there are strange things going on here.
* Dipping the Toe -- From that village, they head east in search of adventure. They discover an aelvar mansion, just returning after being thrust out of time at [[Moon's Fall]]. There they assist the future queen of the [[Crisial Kingdom]], [[Queen Raanee]]. From there, they discover the Temple of the Green Moon...which has severe creeper issues. The priests there are really really weird. Leaving there, they head north, where they get involved with a clan of gryphon-riding dwarves, preventing the takeover by an advisor.
* Looping back to the capital, they realize that other strange things are going on politically. Heading south again, they discover the Saaka Baa tribe, who are under threat from strange, no-nose, lizard-faced individuals (the first encounter by [[Noefra|Noefran]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of the [[Ship Folk]]) who are invading, assisted by devils sent by a fellow claimant for the throne of the Southern Dominion. This they stop, bringing the invasion to a standstill. They also befriend a fashion/beauty-obsessive green dragon.
* Returning to the capital, they discover that [[Kel'al'ar]] is being threatened by an army of tribal [[ophidian]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s...manipulated by the priests of the Green Moon, who are really [[Awakener|Awakener-twisted]] druids (those who brought down the moon on the aelvar empire and ended the 2nd age). They're working in concert with the syndicate's noble patron, who has herself become possessed by the spirit of Lust. Helped by an angel, they enter Lust's mindscape and defeat her, freeing the patron. They then spearhead a trap to destroy the awakener leadership, allowing the Stone Throne army to stop the invasion (the [[Battle of Kel'al'ar]]).
* From there, they press south with aid, destroying the awakener presence at the Temple of the Green Moon.
* Later, they participate in ending the [[Devil's Rebellion]].

== Events ==

* Venturing into the [[Nocthean Caldera]] to investigate why the [[Hungering Frost]] has been so quiet, they encounter the mythic craftsman [[Wayland Smith]] and ask him to design them an airship. He demands certain parts.
* They also assist in building the Bulwark, sealing off the upper valley from the lower caldera floor.
* In searching for various pieces, they
** Enter the [[Plane of Wind]] and make a deal with the ruler of a cloud whale, treating for the necessary equipment to trap lightning essence to serve as the motive power.
** Discover the hiding place of [[Nocthis]], a ritual site where she incarnated (and was held in stasis) to avoid the destruction of the gods at the [[Cataclysm]]. They end the ritual, granting her the necessary worshipers to re-ascend as an [[Ascendant]].
** Enter [[Beastholme]] and treat with a Court of Winter for a fey spirit to serve as binding and guiding spirit for the airship.
** Discover [[Adron's Folly]] and treat with Adron, whose foolishness enabled [[Isskap]] to start the Winter War. Defeating him provides the necessary crystal to serve as the heart of the airship.
* They return to [[Lyodnoir]], where they convince the queen to lend them the resources to have a ship built in [[Byssia]], serving as the hull.
* Taking to the air with a crew of goblin gunners, they encounter the white dragon who serves as [[Isskap]]'s right hand. Grievously wounding her, they force her to flee into the [[Plane of Ice]]. They then land on the top of [[Mount Nyx]] and sabotage the planar ritual that bound the frost to the land, thus ending the primary threat of the [[Hungering Frost]] (even if [[Isskap]] herself wasn't dealt with for another year).

      <text bytes="6077" sha1="rzxdnwx4rlvffu0s80bfq1ep6ld7gte" xml:space="preserve">Modern Runic script is a debasement of Low Runic, the mundane writing system of the [[titans]]. Low Runic, like High Runic (the language of power used by those same [[titans]]), was (as far as anyone knows) logographic (like real-world Mandarin), using an incredibly complex set of concept-runes, where placement in an aggregate rune had meaning. By contrast, Modern Runic (which has remained fundamentally unchanged since the end of the Second Age) is a true alphabet, with characters expressing sound values. It is used by [[Tumni]] (spoken and written by the [[dwarves]]) and [[Too-til]] (also called "Giantish"), spoken and written by the [[jazuu]] and giant-kin of [[Noefra]]. Titan-related races elsewhere in the world use other variants of Low Runic or completely other scripts.

Modern Runic is traditionally written in blocks of four characters, with each word having 4, 8, 12, or very rarely 16 characters. Normally, these are written horizontally from left to right, bottom to top, although older writers will often write bottom to top, right to left. Poetic writings are often arranged into square 2x2 blocks, with part of the art arranging the letters such that you can create multiple readings by changing the direction you read (at least for some phrases). "Perfect" sentences have a total number of characters that is a power of 4. The dwarves of [[Shinevog]], as well as the [[Abandoned Clans]], have started using Reformed Runic, where these numerical restrictions are removed and more letters are added to represent non-tumni phonemes (especially in loanwords). Traditionalists avoid loanword and instead form complex phrases.

Informal writing places spaces between words and varies the size of the symbols (with larger symbols indicating names and other semantic emphasis. Older, more traditional writing does neither of these (hence the rigid adherence to the 4x rule to ease parsing).

== Letter Forms ==
Modern Runic has 28 letter forms, divided (among the dwarves at least) into '''consonants''' (or prime letters), '''vowels''' (secondary letters), and '''particles''' (unspoken letters).

=== Consonants ===
There are 16 consonants. Tumni and Too-til mostly disagree on assignment--they use very similar letter forms and sounds, but assign different letters to different sounds. Generally, words ''spelled'' the same (same sequence of consonants) will have similar meanings but will generally have very different sounds. Each letter has a name associated with it. A few of these can be palatalized by particles: d, r, l, n are the most commonly palatalized.

=== Vowels ===
There are 8 "normal" vowel forms (but note that vowels can be lengthened by particles. These generally keep their sounds consistent between Tumni and Too-til. One caution is that in writing, the number of letters is more important than marking all vowel sounds--words can be shortened to fit the 4x format by leaving out inconvenient vowels, usually an a or eh out of the last syllable. But different dialects will keep different vowels.

== Runic Lexicon ==
Most of these are words recovered from either Low or High Runic. In many cases, word-length was prioritized over vowels, including leaving out all vowels. The pronunciations provided re-insert the consensus reconstruction. All pronunciations use the Tumni reading (for political reasons). The null particle is represented by * and the combining null is :.

Generally, each creature has one Type with possibly one or more subtypes. This document discusses how those fit into the world of Dreams of Hope.

== Creature Types ==

=== Beast ===
Beasts are those creatures that

# Arose naturally or were created by [[Primordials|Primordial]] level entities; they generally trace their roots back to before the [[Dawn War]]. While they may have been selectively bred by mortals since then, they are a longstanding part of the natural order and breed true.
# Participate fully in the cycle of life and death. They eat and are eaten by other creatures (if only in decay); they are born from mothers (or eggs), live normal lifespans and grow from infants to adults, etc. They are part of the food chain.
# Generally do not have complex civilizations or language. There are a few exceptions, but they're rare.
# Generally do not have significant fantastic abilities. They're things that, in principle, could exist on Earth (if you ignore violations of the square-cube law and other pesky details).

For example, the wolf and the dire wolf are both beasts. One is the larger, stronger, more powerful version of the other, but both are perfectly normal, natural creatures.

=== Monstrosity ===
Monstrosity is a bit of a catch-all category, but generally share the following traits.

# Are not humanoid in shape.
# Participate normally in the cycle of life and death and food chain.
# Generally were artificially created originally, usually by non-"natural" means (ie by spells and other magical/alchemical processes rather than simple selective breeding). Such meddling normally is well in the past.
# May breed true OR be "sports" (one-off or limited-number derivations of beasts). 
# May have fantastic abilities such as spell-like abilities, breath weapons, unusual body shapes

For example, the warg is a type of dire wolf that have enhanced intelligence due to ancient meddling. As such, they are nearly human-smart and have language of their own. Winter wolves are similar, but were created by exposure to elemental Ice. They tend to be "sports", popping up in regions heavily influenced by the Plane of Ice. Chimaeric creatures such as...well...chimera and manticores and owlbears fall into this category due to their origins.

=== Aberration ===
Aberrations, while not always tied to the [[Dark Beyond]] and the forces that swim there, frequently are. They

# are generally grotesquely twisted in shape
# have strange, unworldly abilities
# are almost always one-off creations, twisted results of malign energies warping "real" creatures.
# do not participate in the normal cycles. They may not be born (but are created), may live until killed, and often do not eat or drink normally (instead subsisting on esoteric foods such as "thoughts").

=== Humanoids ===
The basic "mortal races". Invariably intelligent and social (although some would say that [[gwerin]] are ''anti-social'' by nature), they are what most people think of as "people". All playable races are humanoids.

=== Giants ===
[[Giant-kin]] or true Giants. All of these either were transformed themselves (see [[Jazuu]]) or are the descendants (in the case of the giant-kin) of failures during that process.

=== Constructs ===
See [[Construct]]. They have true names in fragmentary form.

=== Celestial ===
Celestials are [[lucians]] whose energy/form derives from the [[Great Mechanism]] itself. These might be bonafide members of the [[Angels|Angelic Hosts]] or other residents of the [[Astral]] who are acting on behalf of the [[Congregation]] or the Hosts. They are defined by true names.

=== Fiend ===
Fiends derive their energy/form from mortal soul energy directly. These are of two forms.

* Devils/Infernals (more politically correctly "Contractors") are [[lucians]] or ascended mortals who are paid in the coin of excess energy collected via worship or contractual agreement from mortal souls. Yes, this does make most [[Ascendant|Ascendants]] technically infernal, at least technically. Generally, only members of the [[Diabolical Families]] are referred to by that term. They are defined by true names.

* Demons subsist on souls sacrificed to them and consume souls entire. See [[Demons]] for more details.

=== Undead ===
Undead are the remains of formerly-mortal bodies and spirits animated by various methods. ''Most'' undead are animated by [[jotnar]] and exist to destroy all life. A select few retain their presence due to unfinished business, binding magical oaths, or other unusual means. See [[Undead]] for more details.

=== Fey ===
Fey are groups of [[kami]] that have taken on themselves true names (derived from concepts and emotions). See [[Fey courts]] as well as the article on [[kami]] for more details.

=== Plants ===
Well...plants. At least the less sessile varieties. Often magic was involved in getting them to be more active than most, but sometimes this happens naturally.

=== Ooze ===
Protoplasmic creations, usually alchemical/magical in origin.

=== Elementals ===
Those bound to the Names of the Elemental Planes. Unlike [[lucians]], these share most of their true names and are bound very tightly to the elemental energies they derive their life from. Sometimes humanoids shed part of their mortality to take on elemental nature.

      <text bytes="3439" sha1="2ggamn8ehmzjusdsb2mtoy3vdr3m6vi" xml:space="preserve">It is said that the [[Prehistory|Dreamer]] spoke, sang, and danced the world into existence. The words it spoke were not those of a mortal language--they outright embodied truths about the nascent reality and gathered the mists of the [[Dark Beyond]] around themselves, taking solid form as the 8+1 [[Primordials]]. In essence, those entities were living clusters of Words, instantiations of complex concepts given life by the Dreamer's power and the reactive nature of the Dark. The lesser concepts and progenitor races were formed as those Primordials fractured sub-concepts and gave them independent life to handle more things at once.

Being made of Words in their full form, the primary power of the Primordials was over those Words and anything composed of them--rewriting, adding, and subtracting at will. But only the Dreamer itself could speak totally new Words, bringing new concepts into existence ''ex nihilo''. None of his creations had the innate control over the substance of the Dark, being but subordinate dreams. They owed their very existence to It, drawing sustenance from its eternal flame.

== After the Dawn War ==
In the aftermath of the [[Dawn War]], the Primordials were no more--their Words were used to anchor the new-born planes (other than the [[Nameless]], who was confined in the [[Abyss]]). Some of the lesser concepts still existed in their fallen, [[Broken Concept]] form, but were also exiled from reality. The Dreamer, too, was no more a physical entity, its self having gone into the [[Great Mechanism]]. The multitudes of mortals had been created, with their temporary natures and supernal ability to create, as if they themselves could Dream.

But the True Words continued, if only in fragments. All of the immortals (including [[lucians]] and denizens of the elemental planes) are, at their core, True Words of varying complexity. Usually just a fragment of words and "letters"--the dot of an i, the tail of a script a, etc. This is both a strength and a weakness--as long as the Words are not absorbed into another Word, the immortal will reform even if its body (which is aether bound and condensed around that central truth) is destroyed. In essence, only another immortal or a [[jotnar]] can completely destroy an immortal. On the other side of the coin, the fixed nature of the Words and the lack of anyone who can truly speak these words means that immortals can only change in limited ways unless they absorb another immortal's Words. They are bound to the fragments of meaning that their Word embodies. This includes those mortals who gave up their Sparks in exchange for Words during their ascension, securing immortality at the price of growth. Immortals also depend on external energy for their existence, not being able to create their own. And those that depend on worship ''become'' what is worshipped, to a greater or lesser degree.

== Magic And True Words ==
Magic, as it is seen among mortals, involves manipulating true words. "Arcane writings" are fragments of written representations of True Words; verbal components are tiny fragments of True Words, and material and somatic components are the physical and rhythmic echoes of the Dreamer's dance and song in the beginning. It is said that the runic powers of the Titans and the spoken sorceries of the Wyrm, along with the All-song of [[Leviathan]], were truer, purer renditions of those primal Words.

It is the major population center of the [[Wyrmhold]]-controlled portion of the caldera. Named after the wizard [[Adron ka Ipsalan]], a dragonborn arcanist who built a mage tower near the site (adjacent to the pre-[[Hungering Frost]] village of Chornozem); his Folly was assuming he could treat with [[Isskap]] fairly. His lust for power brought about, in part, the Winter War and led to the downfall of Old Wyrmhold. After the end of the Winter War, the tower became a site of research and the local goblins who had allied with the [[Wyrmhold]] forces allowed the founding of a settlement. As the main entry point and controlling strong point for access to the southern contested territory, it has grown tremendously, now numbering about 4,000 permanent residents, plus a major military garrison.

Built sometime early in the [[Ages of the World|Second Age]] after aelvar mages tortured tribes of local goblins into summoning their "deity" (to be used as a source of power). This back-fired when the [[Adversary]] answered the call from the [[Abyss]] and quickly proved too much for the mages to handle. It took a combined coalition of aelvar, the angelic Legions, fiendish Families, rune-wielding giants and sorcerous dragons to contain the entity. It is believed that the containment somehow holds the entity between the timelines in a null space. It is believed that if the Adversary were to fully escape, the entire continent would have to be reduced to ash to prevent it from corrupting the whole world.

It was maintained for millennia by unknown hands, but that lapsed at some point. In 246 AC (roughly), a mage from the [[Phoenix Empire]] opened the outer wards and enacted some sort of ritual that cracked the inner prison, letting the entity's influence leak out. This caused the event known as the [[Reweaving]]. Its continued influence has warped the surrounding area, now known as the [[Vale of Corruption]].

== Relevant Lore ==
A family of [[Ikela|Ikelans]] has maintained a book of lore and prophecies relating to the site and its prisoner, supposedly dating back to the unknown maintainers. Each generation has one woman called as Watcher (lore-keeper and rememberer) and one other person called as Seeker. The Seeker goes to Charn and somehow "bonds" with the wards. Later in life, the previous Seeker becomes the Guide who leads the next Seeker and explains the history. The current Seeker is [[Fai]]; his mother serves as Watcher. Most of the book is in an unknown language related to yonwach. Some sections have been translated, including the following poem, believed to tell about the construction of the prison:&lt;blockquote&gt;angels to see (amaranthine heart) 

wyrm to destroy (unsleeping enemy) 

fiends to design (prison eternal) 

titans to build (unchanging bulwark) 

summoners to deny (coiling malice) 

sacrifice to bind (between the lines)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The exact personalities and rites vary by village--each village maintains its own shrines. As a collective, their worship is generally benign. Token sacrifices of flowers, food, animal feathers or wool, plants. Each shrine is watched by a priest of sorts, who usually also serves as the area's [[kami]] servant, village social worker, and often herbalist and druidic/divine practitioner. They rarely have significant magical power--a few blessings, a cure for poisons and common diseases (mostly herbal) and similar.

Gossips in the [[Astral]] paint those that actually have ascended as rural country bumpkins, an assembly of people who talk and worry but don't actually do much. They are firmly lower-ranked ascendants.

Founded about 300 years ago around the crystals that make up the body of the Other. Originally a sacred space tended by monks, it became a haven for those who fled the corruption of the Adversary after the [[Reweaving]]. The Other both shields the village from the corrupted and prevents further degeneration by the afflicted while inside its radius of influence.

Recently, it was re-vitalized by [[Tempus Machina]], who recovered the Other's heart, which had been stolen a decade ago by a neighboring tribe.

== Notable Individuals ==

* Alois, [[Fai]]'s uncle.
* Chatty, one of the former priests of the Other. Spent a decade feeding his life-force into the Other to preserve it after its heart was stolen, now recovering. Not very vocal.
* Quarters, the village quartermaster.
* Elphas, leader of the "young bucks" who serve as the guards and hunters.

== Personnel ==

* Fiona ka'Anu. Silver dragonborn druid. Noble born, but distanced from her family. Native to the Caldera.
* Simalanthe Genlamin. Half-elf (sharp-ear) ranger. Born out of wedlock to a member of a noble House of the [[gwerin]], fostered on a distantly-related merchanter family in [[Asai'ka]].
* Telarendril Hawal. [[Gwerin]] noble, ranger. Looking for his lost company of scouts who fought in the last Winter War against the [[Hungering Frost]].
* Kvychya. Halfling cleric of [[Kela Loran]]. Runaway from an arranged marriage. Looking for freedom at the bottom of a coinpurse.

== Associated Personnel ==

* Zip of the Shrikenest. Goblin (barbegazi) wizard. Taken prisoner by the group, but has proven his worth.
* Daen Kydell. Human (wall-builder) warrior, rune-scarred. Currently on detached duty conducting negotiations with the Shrikenest.
* &lt;monk&gt;. Human (nights-child) monk and elementalist. Currently on detached duty conducting negotiations with the Shrikenest.

== Adventures ==

* Into the Goblin Tunnels:
**Gathered at the [[Frostbound Wall]] late summer 251 AC
**Arrived at [[Medvyed]] after defeating some tunnel-worms for a bounty
**Took up residence in a haunted house (haunted by the very tidy spirit of the former owner).
**Ambushed the [[Shrikenest]] goblins coming up from a hidden tunnel and pretending to be Hornet Tribe.
**Later, with Zip in tow as a hostage, delved into the tunnels. Fought [[Red Ice]] intruders as well as giant spiders.
**Discovered evidence of the [[Deep Mind]], as well as a vault with 3 keys. As part of this, they dispelled a portal to the [[Plane of Ice]].
**Found two of the keys secreted on dead bodies in the underground tunnel network.
**Talked to a ghost who pointed them toward [[Old Wyrmhold]] and the crypts there.
* Wyrm King's Rest
**Arrived in [[Old Wyrmhold]], found they needed the sponsorship of a [[Registered Companies|Registered Company]] to enter.
**After talking with [[Imperial Legacy]], a representative from [[Selan's Seekers]] (creepy), and a sage of [[Guardians of the Forgotten]], they signed on with the latter. Promised to seal off the [[Nechrarch|Nechrarchs']] Quarters.
**Heard rumors of an elven woman with the same scout insignia as Telarendril.
**Delving into the catacombs, they bypassed the Demon Door with a map provided by GotF, entered the Nechrarchs' Quarters, defeating the undead there and sealing the place after retrieving some genealogies.
**Further in, they encountered a fragment of [[Broken Order]] which was causing the undead to regenerate, along with a dragon-mashup hybrid entity. Laying both of those to rest, they uncovered a stash of documents and artifacts in the ancient king's tomb.
**Those documents included
***The original Wyrmhold Agreement giving the [[Dragonborn]] a place in the [[Nocthian Caldera]]. This was signed by the "Underking", the ruler of a yet unknown civilization.
***One of the pieces of the wyrmhold royal regalia, the Ring of Night
***A secondary treaty where a former ruler got help in exchange for promising to tell the ancient [[Nocthians]] it was safe to return.
***Correspondence showing that the Wyrmholders had violated both treaties multiple ways.
***Evidence that the current noble families (except the queen herself) are not actually descended from the original noble families.
**They also discovered the third key, along with a stone that supposedly should have been used to signal the Nocthian return.
**Simgen and Fiona were both touched by things found there--Simgen by what appears to be residual frost-aspected energies on a note left by [[Isskap]], Fiona by the [[True Word]] at the heart of the fragment. The effects of these are as of yet unknown. 
**Returning to the surface, they found out that more time had passed than expected and the battle against the fragment of order was very flashy.
**They officially joined [[Guardians of the Forgotten]] and are currently deciding what to do with the (explosive) documents discovered.
**They returned the regalia (mostly) to the Queen of Wyrmhold and were rewarded. Telarendril left the party here.
*To New Nocthia
**They traveled to [[New Nocthia]] via the Caldera route, stopping to clear a vault full of were/demon creatures.
**They got involved in some shenanigans in the city, including hiring help and scaring the crap out of a fey.
**They acquired a magic map that showed the locations of all the vaults and earpieces/cores.
*To Mt Nyx
**They headed up NW, rounding up earpieces (acquiring a Knowledge one from a friendly mercenary group of giantkin).
**They cleared out a vault, freeing a succubus prisoner and destroying the vampire resident. They've taken over this place, naming it the Halfway House.
**They stopped by an ancient prison on the south flank, where the War core was hidden. They defeated the fey named Pain who ruled it, giving power to the local goblins in exchange for prisoners to torment.
**Freed some people, including [[Nocthis|Nocthis's]] former husband and [[Ascendant]]. He's in hiding from her currently.
**Headed up north to [[Nighthold]].
**Discovered that the city's ruins were inhabited by feral, degenerate goblins (barely able to use language).
**The military HQ (where the remaining cores were placed) was inhabited by intelligent automatons:
***The Duty are humanoid ones with strong fealty to the [[Deep Mind]]
***The Pack is a distributed consciousness across many non-humanoid robots, mostly interested in playing. Sometimes playing rough.
***The Archivists are 4 individual consciousnesses in the equipment of the [[Apocalypse Archive]], a secure storage facility for dangerous artifacts gleaned by the [[nocthians]] throughout the ages.
**The party allied with all of them
**The party cleaned out the remnants of [[Broken Order]] which had coalesced inside [[Mount Nyx]] and driven out the goblins there, banishing it to the Abyss. Fiona's influence by [[Broken Order]] was ended after it was banished to the [[Abyss]].
**They recovered the remaining cores and re-assembled the [[Deep Mind]] with explicit commands to basically not do much and restricted access.
**They also made a pass through Wyrmhold's holdings, recovering the other two cores and earpieces. Lady _____ came with them to the Halfway House as she was under threat from various nefarious forces.
***Attacked by assassins, cut deal to stop the interference from [[Sorrow's Thorn]] in the succession dispute of the plane of ice.
*Recovering Fiona's Memories
**To the [[Palace of Shimmering Waters]], met the [[Morrigan]]. Cut a deal with Sorrow's Thorn to pull back in exchange for the party to ensure that none of the existing claimants to Ice's throne won.
**To the [[Plane of Ice]] ([[Hall of Frozen Memory]]) to recover Fiona's memories. Made some enemies of various parties.
***Also discovered that the influence of [[Isskap]] on Simgen was more than just a single memory--it's a literal fragment of her soul (specifically the parts devoted to the ongoing stability of the Plane of Ice). It desires to lay down its burden.
**Helped the [[Wild Hunt]] against demons.
**Found Fiona's child [[Illia ka'Anu]]
**Danced with [[Terpsichore]]
*Heading North/Depot
**North to the [[Scalefoot]]
**Shenanigans with leadership, including murdering the warlord under pretense of a party in a Magnificent Mansion. Aided and abetted by others.
**Met [[Sargoranyx]], the adult white dragon who (lightly) rules there.
**Headed to the Machinery Depot, got rudely rejected at the front gate. Heading in the top.
**The Machinery Depot was occupied by insane, hyper-xenophobic outcasts from [[Sigani]] territory, who were using its technology to "ascend" to corporeal immortality by replacing their bodies progressively with mechanical parts.
**After some incidents, they made a deal to teach the outcasts to [[Blood magic|encode their souls into objects]] as a (possibly more successful) alternative to their current path, in exchange for the earpieces present there and a promise not to interfere with the outside. They also (successfully?) sabotaged the training so that it would fail in a (hopefully) undetected manner.
**From there, they headed into [[Sigani]] territory, where they met envoys and negotiated a trade deal, in exchange for favors and letting the [[Sigani]] have access to the [[Deep Mind]].
**They fought a mutated deep drake that had occupied the Sigani treasury, gaining favor.
*Into the Ice
**After teleporting back to the [[Halfway House]], they decided to deal with the issues around the [[Plane of Ice]] and the [[Glacierheart]].
**Decided to back [[Elphas]] as a surprise candidate.
**Traveled to the Plane to begin politicking to gain their candidate a power base.

      <text bytes="7745" sha1="f0yvt1rnx5cb5nnxwhqju9ejos7dtfx" xml:space="preserve">Unlike the real world, coinage on [[Quartus]] has been much more stable throughout history, mainly due to magical enforcement. Standards have varied over time and many different devices have graced coins, but four general types of coin have been known.

== Ancient Times ==
Very few examples of pre-3rd-age coinage remain. From records uncovered among the [[Tuura Adam]], it seems that the ancient [[Titans|titan]] civilizations used rune-marked stones as means of account, where the runes indicated personal power. As such, they were claims on someone else's rune-working powers. As the [[wyrm]] rarely congregated and were always few in number, it's doubtful that they used any coinage at all.

The [[aelvar]] of the 2nd age used coins, to be sure. A few examples of gold, platinum, and silver have been recovered. In addition, it seems that high-value exchange was done in the form of arcanely-etched crystals and gems infused with aether, probably similar to modern [[magicite]].

== Noefran 3rd Age ==
During the age of Man, each of the two Noefran empires established their own currency.

=== Quan Pei ===
/TODO

=== Tibor Imperia ===
The western empire used a pattern very much like the modern Council Mark--platinum, gold, silver, and bronze. The weights and compositions varied, with later-era coins being notoriously poor in quality. The gold coins were called "crowns" and generally bore a crown on one side and the current emperor's face on the other. Silver eagles had the empire's two-headed eagle mark opposite a crown. Copper (really bronze) coins were minted regionally and their marks varied.

=== Post War of Souls ===
After the breakup of [[Tibor Imperia]], the follow-on states generally kept to similar patterns, although the markings varied. One notable exception to the varying quality were the coins of the [[Iron Dominions]], minted at [[Hammerhead]]. Marked with crossed hammers on the obverse and a set of runic markings for the sequence number (related to the year they were minted), these coins were substantially larger than most others and exceptionally regular in composition. For this reason, "hammerheads" were the "gold standard" for coinage of that era.

== Noefran Post-Cataclysm ==
The nations of the East still tend to use coinage derived from that of [[Quan Pei]], while the west has mostly (in the [[Federated Nations]] at least), settled on the Council Mark as the standard of coinage. Each nation mints their own, but weights and purities are standardized. For ease of adventuring, all adventuring pricing and valuation is done in the Council Mark unit. These coins are still minted all over the [[Successor States]] and represent the bulk of the FNC coinage in circulation, although

=== Council Mark System ===
First derived by the [[dwarves]] of [[Fuar Uulan]] for the [[Council Lands]], the Council Mark is a decimal metallic monetary system using four metals as references: platinum, gold, silver, and copper (really bronze). All coins are standardized to 50 per pound (actually ''defining'' the pound as 50 gold Council Marks) and 1 platinum piece = 10 gold pieces = 100 silver pieces = 1000 copper pieces. In reality, since a platinum mark is so valuable and rare, all valuation uses the gold council mark as a reference. All alloys are standardized to 90%:10%, with the 10% usually being copper (or tin in the case of the copper mark).

==== Platinum Coins ====
The platinum mark, often called a "moon mark" in the [[Successor States]] is 90% platinum and 10% cobalt. They get their name because they were commonly struck with the twin crescent moons facing each other in the dwarven mints at [[Kaelthia]]. The reverse contains, as usual, a glyph for the minting year. In size, they're about the size of a modern US dime--about 2 cm in diameter, 1.3 mm in thickness. The edges are reeded (knurled, cut into lines like the US dime). The [[Wyrmhold]] platinum crown is similar, but stamped with the mark of the crown and a stylized dragon on the reverse. Byssia does not mint platinum coins, preferring to use (where necessary) those of other nations. The former [[Stone Throne]] minted the blue serpent coins, where the cobalt gave a blue sheen to the stamped coiled serpent.

==== Gold Coins ====
Gold marks are the largest coin in common use. Classic [[Successor States]] gold marks are nicknamed "god marks" or "holies", as they are conventionally marked with one of the symbols of the [[Seasonal Four]] depending on the season of coinage on the obverse. In size, they're about the same as a modern US penny--1.5 mm thick and about 2 cm in diameter, with reeded edges. Wyrmhold gold dragons have a crowned dragon on the obverse with a laurel wreath on the reverse. [[Asai'ka]] ororobai have a serpent eating its tail on the obverse and a phrase in Iath Neidr on the obverse (written counter-clockwise around the edge); neither the [[Serpent Dominion]] nor the [[Sha'slar Autonomous Zone]] commonly mint their own gold coins. Byssian palms are thinner and larger and often irregular, with plain reverses and a palm leaf on the obverse. They're fairly rare.

==== Silver Coins ====
Silver coins make up the bulk of the actively-used coinage and are commonly called a "tenpenny" throughout the FNC. Those minted in the [[Successor States]] have a stylized mountain on the obverse and an inscription praising [[Kela Loran]] on the reverse. Wyrmhold silver pieces have a tree on the obverse and a celtic-style cross on the reverse. [[Asai'ka]] silver coins are stamped with whatever the current ruler's profile is, with an inscription praising the Queen Ascendant on the reverse. [[Serpent Dominion]] silvers have a serpent fang on the obverse, but similar reverses. Byssian silvers have a stylized flame on the obverse and waves on the reverse.

==== Copper Coins ====
Technically, all the coppers are really bronze. But who's checking. Usually just called a "penny". Since their metal value isn't really bound to their face value, there is much more variation, with each larger populated area (possibly even down to the town) minting their own. As long as they basically keep to the standards, no one cares.

== Soefran Coins ==
/todo

== Currencies of other Planes ==
The standard unit of account in the [[Astral]] is the "unit", also called a "soul coin" by the more old-fashioned. It represents the average daily excess aether production of a standard humanoid mortal. Coins are not used--instead, each resident has an identification card that also serves as a bank book; deposits and payments are made remotely and virtually. Generally, mortal coins trade 10:1 for units; gemstones and other aether-rich items trade at closer to parity. 

== Verification ==
The [[Adventurer’s Guild]] is responsible for enforcing the coinage standards within the FNC. This they do by handing out ritual tools and knowledge to all their [[associate merchants]]. This takes the form of a small basin with arcane inscriptions. A simple ritual chant activates the bowl, into which the suspect coins have been placed. The ritual assays the coins and glyphs around the outside glow in particular patterns indicating the composition (at least as far as the precious metals go) and the mass. This allows ancient coins recovered by adventurers to be fairly and accurately assayed and valued. Attempting to manipulate this ritual is a serious crime in all of the FNC. Strangely, counterfeiting coinage isn't policed at the upper levels--individual merchant associations may care, but since all coins are assayed and reminted at the national level, no one in power cares.

Similar patterns exist in most other civilized nations, although the coinage standards and enforcement agencies vary.

Mortal spell-casters often believe themselves the lords of creation...and act that way. Mage hunters are trained to counter those. They employ the inversion of a family of techniques called formshaping--manipulating aether into the platonic shapes of "forms". Or in this case, shaping their personal aether to ''disrupt'' patterns, especially those created by spell-casting.

This is an archetype of the Rogue class.

== Features ==

=== Shaping Dice ===
You have four shaping dice, each of which is a d6. You use these to empower your archetype features. You regain expended dice when you complete a short or long rest. The the size of each die increases with level as shown on the Mage Hunter.

=== Disruptive Strike ===
Starting at level 3 when a creature within your reach (if wielding a melee weapon) or normal range (if wielding a ranged weapon) begins casting a spell or using a magical ability, you can use your reaction and spend a shaping die to make an attack against them with a wielded weapon. If it hits, you add the result from your shaping die to the damage dealt and the target must make a concentration check at disadvantage. On a failed check, the spell or magical ability fails and the spell slot or charge is consumed.

=== Magical Awareness ===
Also starting at level 3, you can create the effect of ''detect magic'' or ''identify'' without requiring components or a spell slot or concentration twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a long or short rest.

=== Slippery Form ===
Starting at level 9, your awareness of the limits of spell-craft has increased. You can expend a shaping die when you make an ability check or saving throw against a spell or magical effect and add the result to your total. You can do so after you know whether you've succeeded or failed.

=== Greater Disruptive Strike ===
Starting at level 13, your ability to disrupt magical effects has increased. As an action you can spend a shaping die to make an attack against a magical effect you can perceive. On an attack roll of 10 or higher, treat the effect as if you had cast ''dispel magic'' at 3rd level. For effects from higher level spells, your attack roll is the ability check; if the attack roll exceeds 10 + the spell's level, the spell effect ends. This can even disrupt magical effects that cannot be dispelled by ''dispel magic'', such as ''force cage'' and ''wall of force'', assuming the result is high enough.

=== Resurgent Shaping ===
Starting at level 17, you recover your ability to shape forms more quickly. When you expend your last shaping die, roll a d20. On a result of 10 or above, the shaping die is not expended.

      <text bytes="6472" sha1="dyfyndo49ug4wfjrce6a6h7jnugjcrq" xml:space="preserve">Formshapers, unlike conventional mages, don't manipulate external aether into resonant patterns. Instead, they study the essential nature of forms themselves--finding the platonic ideal of a concept and then using their personal aether to replicate this concept, often in the form of a pseudo-physical object. Often, this "form" has a blue glow and looks as if it is made out of solidified light.

Formshapers and conventional spell-casters are often at odds--the search for the ideal of the form is hampered by the twisting of aether involved in casting spells. And the level of control over one own's aether makes spells less effective against an experienced formshaper. As such, many cultures have trained formshapers as mage-killers or wardens for magically-endowed prisoners. In return, spell-casting-dominated cultures have often outlawed or strictly controlled the study of formshaping.

== Forms ==
Note: these aren't being used by anything right now.

=== Ankheg Gorget ===
A chitinous gorget of dull gold encircles your throat. You gain resistance to acid damage. ''Active effect'': As an action or as an attack in the Attack action you can expend a shaping die to spit acid. Make a proficient ranged attack roll using your shaping modifier against a creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, the creature takes acid damage equal to one roll of your shaping die + your shaping modifier.

=== Astral Wings (level 5) ===
You sprout wings made of electric blue aether. You gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed. ''Active effect'': When you would take damage from a ranged attack or ability that forced a Dexterity saving throw, you can expend a shaping die. The damage you take is reduced by the amount you rolled plus your shaping modifier.

=== Beast Mask ===
A mask of aether patterned after an animal's head appears over your face, although your vision is not obstructed. While you are shaping this form, you have expertise in Animal Handling and can use that skill to influence beasts and beast-like monstrosities as if you were using a Charisma check. ''Active Effect'': As an action, roll a shaping die and choose up to half your proficiency bonus in beasts or monstrosities that can see you within 60 ft. Each target must make a Charisma saving throw against your shaping DC. On a failed save, the creatures are charmed by you for one minute and cannot attack you or your allies while charmed. If the result of the d20 is under the number you rolled on your shaping die and they fail the saving throw, they are instead turned to your side and will attack your enemies for 1 minute, although you cannot command them. After the domination effect ends, they will attempt to flee if possible, turning hostile if not. On a successful save, the targets are frightened of you until the end of their next turn and then immune to further effects from this form for 24 hours.  

=== Bulwark Armor ===
Your armor is overlaid with a transparent tracery of gold aether. You do not take extra damage from critical hits against you. ''Active effect''. When you are targeted by an attack, you can expend a shaping die to increase your armor class against the triggering attack by half the maximum value of the shaping die (d6 -&gt; +3, d8 -&gt; +4, d10 -&gt; +5)

=== Circlet of Non-Interference ===
A circlet of blazing golden aether with a central "gem" of electric blue encircles your forehead. You make Wisdom saving throws against charm, fear, and domination effects at advantage. ''Active Effect''. When you make a Wisdom saving throw, you can roll a shaping die and add the total to the result of the saving throw. You can do this after you know whether you succeeded or failed on the saving throw.

=== Disruption Armbands ===
Bands of shimmering silver aether inscribed with electric-blue glyphs encircle your wrists. When you hit a construct, undead, or fiend with a weapon attack, you ignore any resistance or immunity to damage types they may have. ''Active Effect'': When you hit a construct, undead, or fiend with a weapon attack, you can roll a shaping die and add the result to the damage dealt. If you are level 11 or higher, the target must also make a Constitution saving throw against your shaping DC. On a failed save they are stunned until the end of your next turn. 

=== Doppleganger's Vestments ===
Your clothing and armor blurs under a mutable shroud of aether. While you are shaping this form, you are under the effects of ''disguise self''. ''Active Effect'': When you make a Charisma check to influence someone, you can roll a shaping die and add the amount rolled to the check result.

=== Dragon Mask ===
A mask of ruby aether in the form of a red dragon's head appears over your face. While you are shaping this form, you have expertise in Intimidation and can use your shaping modifier instead of Charisma on those checks. ''Active Effect'': As an action, roll a shaping die and choose a number of creatures up to half your proficiency bonus that can see you within 60 ft. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw against your shaping DC. On a failed save, the creatures are frightened of you. If the result of the d20 is under the number you rolled on your shaping die and they fail the saving throw, they are so frightened that they cannot move or take any action. Frightened creatures can attempt the saving throw at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success. 

=== Gecko Boots ===
Gleaming green aether forms over your feet. While you are shaping this form, you have a climb speed equal to your walking speed and do not require hands to climb. ''Active Effect''. ...

=== Ghost Ribbon ===
passive perfect darkvision (60 ft). Activate as reaction to blink through obstacles.

=== Elemental Gloves ===
passive resist &lt;element&gt;. Spend die to add &lt;element&gt; damage on hits (mini-smites).

=== Mask of Eyes ===
passive bonus to perception. Spend die to add to initiative.

=== Ogre-grip Gauntlets ===
can grapple bigger/shove further. Spend die to add to grapple/shove checks.

=== Shadow Cloak ===
A cloak of opaque aetheric shadow wraps around you. When you Hide, you can add your shaping modifier to the check total. ''Active Effect'': When you are hidden and hit with an attack, you can roll a shaping die and add the amount rolled to the damage done.

=== Thunderstep Boots ===
passive speed increase. Activate on hit after moving to deal thunder damage and stun target (1 turn)

They focus on the essential form of the shield, shaping their personal aether into protective aegises. But what can shield can also harm, for that is the essential duality. As with all formshapers, their art is in tension with conventional spell-casting.

== Features ==

=== Manifest Shield ===
Starting when you pick this archetype at 3rd level, you can create an aetheric shield that functions as a normal one. As a bonus action, you can create or dismiss an aetheric shield that functions exactly as a normal shield except that it has no weight. When dismissed, it takes up no space and you can use your shield arm freely.

Additionally, at the end of a long or short rest you can form a bond with a magical shield you have in your possession. Once bonded, the shield becomes part of you and can be summoned or dismissed exactly as if it were your aetheric shield.

=== Arcing Shield ===
Starting at 3rd level, as long as you have a shield active (aethereal or bonded), you can use that shield as a weapon. It functions as a thrown (30/120), returning light melee weapon dealing force damage equal to a roll of your shaping die on a hit. Additionally, it functions normally for two-weapon-fighting regardless of the properties of any other wielded weapon. If you have bonded to a magical shield that provides a bonus to AC, it provides the same bonus to attack and damage when used as a weapon. Since what you are throwing is actually an aetheric copy of the weapon, throwing it does not deprive you of the benefit of your shield. Using the shield as a weapon consumes a shaping die if it hits.

=== Shaping Dice ===
You have 4 shaping dice, each of which is a d6. You use these to empower your archetype features. You regain expended dice when you complete a short or long rest. The the size of each die increases with level as shown on the Aegis Seeker table.

=== Trained Intuition ===
Starting at 7th level, you can expend a shaping die to substitute your Intelligence modifier for Wisdom or Charisma when making an ability check or saving throw that would normally use one of those two ability scores. When you do so, roll the shaping die and add the result to the total for the check.

=== Shared Indomitability ===
Starting at 10th level, your Indomitable class feature can be used when you or an ally you can see within 30 feet fails a saving throw. When you use this feature on yourself or someone else, you can also expend a shaping die and add it to the result.

=== Spell Reflection ===
Starting at 15th level, when you are targeted by any spell, spell attack or magical effect, you can use your reaction and expend a shaping die to make a proficient Intelligence check, adding the shaping die to the total against a DC of 10 + the spell level (or half the creature's CR for non-spell magical effects). On a success, the spell is reflected against the caster. None of the original targets suffer any effects, and the caster must make any relevant saving throws against their own DC, suffering the normal effect depending on the result. 

=== Resurgent Shaping ===
Starting at level 18, your shaping dice are fully restored both at the end of a long or short rest or when you roll initiative and have none remaining.

== Features ==

=== Shaping Dice ===
You have 4 shaping dice, each of which is a d6. You use these to empower your archetype features. You regain expended dice when you complete a short or long rest. The the size of each die increases with level as shown on the Whirling Blade table.

=== Aetheric Weapons ===
Starting when you choose this archetype at level 3, you can manifest aetheric blades from one or both of your hands as a bonus action. These glittering blue swords count as light melee weapons with the thrown (60/120) property. Their damage die is equal to your shaping die and they deal your choice of slashing or piercing damage. When you throw one of them as an attack, it reappears instantly in your hands after the attack completes, hit or miss.

Additionally, you can choose to meld with up to two one-handed magical weapons you are touching at the end of a long rest. While bonded, the weapons disappear and any magical properties they possess are replicated on your aetheric blades.

=== Blade Dance ===
You gain the two-weapon fighting style. When you hit with your aetheric blades, you can spend a shaping die to increase the damage done by the amount rolled.

=== Flash Step ===
Starting at level 6, while enraged, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed toward anyone who attacked you or cast a spell with you as a target. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks if you expend a shaping die as part of the reaction.

=== Shielding Tempest ===
Starting at 10th level, you can expend a shaping die when you are targeted by a ranged attack. If you do so, make an attack roll against the attacker's AC. On a hit, you suffer no ill effects from the attack and the attacker instead takes the normal damage of the attack + the amount you rolled on your shaping die. You can only use this once per turn.

=== Warp Strike ===
Starting at 14th level, when you make a thrown attack with your aetheric blade and hit, you can choose to teleport next to the target.

Built in the waning days of [[Tibor Imperia]], it was home to a [[gwerin]] noble family, part of the legacy of the keepers of the [[mysterium magicii]]. In the chaos of the [[War of Souls]], it was besieged by enemies. Those inside gave their lives to summon a [[Broken Concept]] to take the tower and its precious cargo (both one of the orbs as well as their children) out of time. There it remained until returning sometime around 249 AC. Unfortunately, the location now was in the depths of [[Lake Coy'in]], burying the tower under several hundred feet of water. The presence of a lingering fragment of the Concept ([[Broken Memory]]) kept it protected from the environment, but wrapped in a time loop, filled by the echoes of the inhabitants in earlier days.

In 250 AC, the [[Vault Seekers]] investigated the wreckage in search of one of the [[mysterium magicii]]. After fighting through the tower and dancing with the ghosts of the past, they defeated the fragment, liberated the orb...and rescued about 20 surviving [[gwerin]] and [[Humans|human]] children who had been placed into stasis there at the base, the true treasures of the Tower. With the defeat of the Concept, the inrushing water soon made a graveyard of the tower in truth. Members of [[Imperial Legacy]] still brave the depths looking for relics of the past.

It lay fallow until ~248 AC, when archaeologists from [[Ikela]] began to excavate. They were stymied by the layers of timeline breakage present. After many shenanigans in 251 AC, [[Tempus Machina]] put an end to the time bubbles and altered the timeline slightly. Since then, the archaeologists have begun their efforts in earnest.

      <text bytes="2120" sha1="swpf5ulxyajimh8cno7i5qheadp1mc9" xml:space="preserve">The [[Fuar Uulan|Uulani]] [[Dwarves|dwarven]] custom of honoring specific individuals (living and dead) as supreme examples of proper dwarven nature has given rise to the title of Exemplar. By long-standing tradition, there are always living dwarves chosen as Exemplars of the following categories. They sit on the Council of Exemplars by right, although usually the duties are delegated.

== Exemplars of Craft ==
Eight seats, chosen by representatives of the various crafts, which are

* Stonework (including mining)
* Metalwork (all forms)
* Gemwork
* Textiles
* Cuisine (includes brewing)
* Rhetoric/Storytelling
* Music
* Livecrafting (wood, but also non-food agriculture and husbandry)

Generally these are chosen by popular acclaim, often after a competition. Being dwarves, small incremental improvements are much more highly regarded than groundbreaking new methodologies.

Some, less traditional sub-cultures add one or more of the following, but there is less agreement on this matter and they do not sit on the Uulani council.

* Magic/Knowledge
* Trade/Diplomacy
* Exploration
* Beauty

== Exemplars of Virtue ==
The Four Virtues are

* Endurance: Standing as a stone in the stream and not being washed away.
* Faith
* Unity
* Diligence

== Cultural Weight of Exemplar Status ==
Living exemplars have very little direct political power in the Uulani government--the Council of Exemplars is only advisory. However, since Uulani culture is so centered around "clan think", the exemplars have tremendous ''cultural'' power. They are seen as the ultimate example of what dwarves should aspire to be (in that respect at least). This makes the Exemplar title one of tremendous prestige--having a living exemplar in your clan is a ''massive'' status boost. Of course, this makes the selection of a new Exemplar an exquisitely political event, with many factions attempting to find ones that meet the criteria (no one would ever think of appointing someone lacking in the qualities of that post) while still having an attitude favorable to their particular views on society.

Founded in the first days following the [[Cataclysm]], it stands near the peak of Mt. Vigil, a solitary peak NW of [[Fuar Uulan]]. Unlike most of the other great monasteries of western [[Noefra]], it is completely non-political. Here, the Dwellers train body and soul, taking vows of silent contemplation while at the monastery. Dwellers do venture out into the world, acting as passive scribes of events and collectors of books. It is said that the library at Tysh is second only to those kept by the [[Cysgoroesi]]. Dwellers also practice arts of unarmed combat, learning to protect themselves against those that would interfere. Unlike those of the [[Home of the Elements]], they hone the body and soul alone, not relying on elemental forces, and unlike [[Tyom]], they do not hire themselves out as spies and assassins. Both men and women of all races are welcomed...if they can endure the trials. For the Lord of the Mountain is also Lord of Silent Endurance.

Many high peaks, but the average elevation isn't much over 8000-9000 ft. Separated into three ranges:

* Inner Dragon Range. The eastern border. Not much is known about this by westerners. Said to be inhabited by monstrosities, with rogue [[giant-kin]] tribes living in the valleys.
* Vengeance Range. This is the northern section, walling off the land pass to [[Moon's Fall Vengeance]]. No known passes exist through it. Explorers report that it is comprised of sheer, 10000-14000 ft-high glassy cliffs. In the heights, strange beasts have been seen to circle, but there is no other sign of life.
* Serpent Range. Much lower and more hospitable, this forms the eastern border of the [[Jungle of Fangs]]. Populated by tribal humans in the north, the great city of [[Ar Salem Dolem]] in the middle, and the various dwarven tribes (both surface-dwelling, gryphon-riding ones and underground, religious zealots) in the south.

* the Dragon Crown was said to be a relic dating back to the [[Titan-Wyrm War|Titan-Wyrm Wars]]--a crown of dragon bone and astral gold, said to allow communication over large distances. It was lost in the confusion around the [[Cataclysm]], although recent evidence suggests it was used as part of the [[Deep Mind]] and is buried in a vault in the Caldera somewhere.
* The Scepter of Dragon Kings is a golden scepter topped with a cylindrical "head" of rune-inscribed stone. That head is actually part of the [[Orb of All Might]], although this is not known generally. The scepter is in the possession of [[Wyrmhold]] as of 251 AC. The origin of this item is unknown, although documents recovered by [[Half Measures]] say that it was created by a mysterious entity/nation known as the Underking.
* The Ring of Moons, a silver ring with gemstones representing the two moons, was given by the ancient [[Nocthians]] as a symbol of acceptance. It has no particular magical significance. It was lost in the scramble after the start of the Winter War. [[Half Measures]] recovered it from the vault of the Wyrm King near [[Old Wyrmhold]] but has not publicized that fact.
* The Ring of the Sun, a gold ring with a large piece of yellow jade embedded in it, was granted by the residents of the Lupaus Plains (now part of Wyrmhold proper). It also has no magical significance. Like the scepter it is in the possession of the Wyrmhold government as of 251 AC.

Devout worshipers of the [[Old Gods|Old God]] [[Nocthis]] in her aspect as Lady of Mystery, they were a matriarchal culture that eschewed entanglements with the outside. Secretive in the extreme, they remained a distinct nation even during the most expansionist parts of [[Tibor Imperia]]'s reign. How they managed this is unknown, although some believe that it had to do with the dormant volcano slumbering under [[Mount Nyx]].

During the post-Imperial era, the Nocthians started accumulating artifacts and items of power by hook or crook, including sending covert squads to "acquire" them by force. This they did believing that it was their religious duty to keep those secrets out of the hands of those that could not be trusted.

During the [[Cataclysm War]] the Nocthians managed to withstand the Army of Chaos through means that are not quite clear, although some evidence points to an army of mechanical constructs commanded by something called the [[Deep Mind]]. Very soon afterward (by 45 AC), an unknown force made the entire Nocthian people flee through a secret tunnel to the south, becoming the ancestors of the modern [[Byssia|Night's Children of Byssia]].

Dating back before the [[Cataclysm]], the artifact is comprised of 5 pieces: four cores and a central base that allows the cores to communicate and blend together into one will. 

Each core is a quarter-cylinder about 2 feet long and one foot wide, made out of obsidian-like stone and inscribed with aetherically-conductive veins of various metals and runic writings. Believed to have been constructed originally by dwarves who somehow granted these cores a form of sentience and will. The cores independently can speak, hear, and see as if they had normal senses, but can also scry on things known to them personally. Each core has 4 "terminals", astral-gold earpieces that allow wearers to communicate over near-infinite distances with the core. The terminals allow the core to perceive through their wearers' senses as well. Each core can sense the location of their own terminals and can sense the presence (within a few miles) of terminals belonging to other cores. They have a vague sense of the direction and relative distance (near vs far) of other cores. The cores cannot dominate minds but are incredibly persuasive and have an alien sense of morality, leaving them totally fine with lying if it suits their purposes.

While separated, the cores have their own desires and wills and do not necessarily cooperate. Once they are attached to the central base and tied together via a cross-shape data bus,  their minds fuse into one, producing the entity known as the Deep Mind, with all the terminals cooperating. It is believed that during the [[Cataclysm War]], the [[Wyrmhold Regalia|Dragon Crown]] was enchanted and attached to the assembled Mind, allowing it to control legions of mechanical constructs. This went badly, however.

Reports indicate that he was once a junior monk of the [[Church of the Seasons]], cloistered in the [[Temple of the Four]]. Since his renunciation of his former name, he has shown great power, foiling multiple attempts on his life by assassins loyal to the old government. He has never acted against anyone who didn't act directly against him or his folk. Reported to be ''extremely'' charismatic, capable of converting dire enemies into allies in a short sermon.

He has the total loyalty of the [[Holy Hands]], who act as his enforcers.

He preaches the [[Law of Truth (Religion)|Law of Truth]], a quasi-monotheistic (but not god-centric) religion/ethos based around hard work, avoidance of "mercantilism", and inward living. By all accounts, he lives it as well, wearing nothing but rough monk garb and going barefoot, eating grain pottage and dark heavy bread and drinking nothing but water.

      <text bytes="1417" sha1="jje87y78xakkon7x5iwyd1oygyswjfd" xml:space="preserve">Formerly (during the Council Era) known as Kelvintown, after the pre-[[Cataclysm]] mage/lord who made his home there along with a small, sleepy village. It was Kelvin who gave the [[Refuge Seekers]] and the refugees of the [[Cataclysm War]] permission to settle the city named as [[Kaelthia]], separated by the flanks of what is now known as Mt. Refuge.

During the [[Council Lands]] period, a dwarven-engineered tunnel was carved from Old [[Kaelthia]] through Mt Refuge to Kelvintown. In 205 AC, the [[Catalysts]] took possession of Kelvin's (who had passed away about 15 years previously) manor, [[Hound's Rest]] and made their base there.

After the [[Crystal Spire War]], the [[Adventurer’s Guild]] claimed the town as part of a settlement, shifting the [[Portal Network]] node located there a short distance from [[Hound's Rest]] and building administrative facilities there. It became known as Guildtown, second administrative center of the [[Federated Nations]] after [[Fort Hope]]. The [[Catalysts]] continued to be based there officially, although in reality [[Vassarian Kabir]] was the primary resident, with the others having their own homes.

All the gate-based traffic for [[Kaelthia]] (up until the embargo in early 251 AC) passes through Guildtown. Officially it is an independent enclave rather than part of the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]].

Started about 15 years after the start of the [[Winter War]] with the [[Hungering Frost]] with the foundation of the North Fort, it was steadily (and very slowly) expanded every year. Most of the heaviest battles of that war occurred in its immediate vicinity, often in the valley just caldera-ward of it. A final push to complete the wall happened in late 205 AC when [[Catalysts|Catalyst]] [[Kalesin]] led the [[dragonborn]] of the [[Council Lands]] to rejoin their kin. This final battle managed to throw back the Frost far enough to complete the wall, ending the major hostilities of the war.

A gigantic earth-and-stone truncated pyramid nearly 200' tall and 80' thick at the base at its thinnest point, it extends between a chain of forts. The top and caldera side are studded with artillery cutouts and embrasures; the interior has walkways and (at the inner side of the base) storage rooms and barracks. Behind the wall at the one gate is the major military encampment of the [[Wyrmhold]] military. Up the valley is the town of Frosthold, once the last outpost in friendly territory, now a staging point for traffic down the pass and out into the caldera.

Passage through the wall is controlled by the military, with merchants paying significant taxes and all first-time visitors being required to take an orientation class.

Starting in 115 AC, it ended in 205 AC with the construction of the [[Frostbound Wall]] and then a few years later with the fall of [[Isskap]] at the hands of the [[Wild Cards]]. For all but the last year or so, the fighting was carried out entirely by the forces of [[Wyrmhold]], occupying nearly the entire adult population of the nation during winter time. Only the defensive nature and the fact that it was mostly during the fallow winter time spared the people. At the final set of battles, forces from across the [[Federated Nations]] region participated, including companies of rangers, large masses of dragonborn from the [[Council Lands]], dwarven engineers, and even [[Byssia|Byssian]] elementalists.

Ostensibly friendly with [[Wyrmhold]], they were tricked/bribed/threatened into participating in false-flag attacks against the town of [[Medvyed]] in an effort by the [[Red Ice]] tribe (under the direction of the War segment of the [[Deep Mind]]) to spark a war between the forces of [[Wyrmhold]] and those of the [[Hornet Tribe]], the Shrikenest's insular southern neighbors.

This was halted by the efforts of [[Half Measures]] and the Shrikenest have now become formally allied with [[Wyrmhold]] after the [[Red Ice]] were defeated at the Battle of Medvyed in late summer 251 AC.

== Notable People ==

* Zip, a goblin arcanist who participated in the false-flag and was captured and then befriended by [[Half Measures]]. Currently living in [[Medvyed]] where he is courting a member of the Honey Badger "tribe".

Started with reports that beasts of the local forest were stalking a child and that attempts to log the forest had been violently rejected.

== Events ==

* The child, named Elena, had been badly injured by her abusive father and was "simple". Although physically 16, she was mentally about 4.
* The beast had not hurt anyone, but large lupine footprints had been found and those working near the child had been watched.
* The party delved into the woods, avoiding and dealing with unnaturally angry and coordinated beasts.
* At the center, they found an ancient tree, whose spirit was concerned for Elena and offered a bargain--allow it to bond with the child, merging its spirit with the child's. In exchange, the child would be safe, healed, and have a long life. The tree would get a voice and the strength to resist "corruption from the south".
* They ended up making that bargain after punishing the abusive father.
* This grove of trees is now known as the [[Lady's Grove]] and [[Safrir Tree-friend]] is its guardian and he and Elena (now the host of the ancient tree spirit but still herself as well) are co-leaders of that grove.

They are used to ascend [[jazuu]] into true giants. None of the known ones are truly complete, but some have the potential to usher the ascension to the rank of ruler (aka cloud giant).
[[File:Titanwall.jpg|center|thumb|1100x1100px]]

== Known Locations ==

=== Noefra ===

* There is one complete (as far as they get) one in [[Too Tekterin]] in the lands of the [[Tuura Adam]], located on the first (lowest) ring of the citadel, nearest to the city of [[Kozhuyn]].
* Ancient records indicate that there was once one in the [[Ladyfrost Mountains]], but its exact location and whether it has survived is lost to history.
* Some [[Wyrmhold|Wyrmholders]] and [[Byssia|Byssians]] speculate that there must be one in the [[Nocthian Caldera]] due to the numbers of giants (predominantly frost, but hill giants have also been spotted), especially in the western reaches. None has been found, however.

=== Soefra ===
There are no known locations in [[Soefra]].

=== Oelfra ===
There are 6 in various states of completion in the lower "boot" of the continent. They are considered sacrosanct by the giantish nations of that continent. Free access is granted to worthy seekers and pilgrims, where worthy is judged by the orders of monks that protect each site.

      <comment>/* Common Incantations */</comment>
      <origin>2530</origin>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text bytes="36026" sha1="7zzhqs3cbhawm48s1hzogetrcsag707" xml:space="preserve">An alternate method of creating spell-like effects. Available to anyone of the appropriate strength (ie level). Requires a special item called a Ritual Scroll, which is not consumed on use.

Note: names in [square brackets] are the PHB spell that this mimics.

== Finding and Learning Incantations ==
The knowledge to perform an incantation is encoded into Ritual Scrolls. These are similar to spell scrolls of the same rarity, with the difference that they are not consumed on use but that performing the incantation requires reading from the enchanted scroll. Characters can prepare a Ritual Scroll following the same rules as crafting a spell scroll; the rarity of the incantation matches the rarity of the “spell scroll” created. 

Successfully performing an incantation requires a certain strength of will above all. Mechanically, this translates into level requirements. Incantations come in similar rarities to magic items, with corresponding level requirements to perform.

Common incantations can be learned by anyone. They correspond to spells of levels 1-2 as well as cantrips.

Uncommon incantations require at least someone of level 5. They generally correspond to spells of levels 3-5.

Rare incantations require at least someone of level 11. They generally correspond to spells of levels 6-7.

Very Rare incantations require level 15 to perform. They generally correspond to 8th level spells.

Legendary incantations require someone of level 17 to perform. They correspond to 9th level spells.

== Incantation Tags and Costs ==
Each incantation has one or more tags that summarize the costs associated with performing the ritual. The exact details are explained in the text of the incantation entry. The tags are listed below:

'''Costly''' (X): This incantation requires a component with value of at least X gp, and that component is consumed per performance.

'''Focus''' (X): This incantation requires a component with value of at least X gp, but that component is not consumed in the casting.

'''Debilitating''' (X): Performing this incantation is exhausting. If you perform it again before finishing a long rest, anyone participating gains X levels of exhaustion, with subsequent performances causing stacking penalties.

'''Debilitating''' (Major, X): Like Debilitating, except takes place immediately on first use per long rest as well as subsequent uses.

'''Exclusive''': The effects of this incantation immediately end if the incantation is performed again or if the target of the incantation is targeted by any other incantation.

'''Cooldown''' (X): This incantation can only be performed once every X amount of time.

'''Group''' (N): This incantation requires N people who all know the incantation. All share in any negative effects/costs.

'''Location''': This incantation can only be performed at specific locations as described in the text. Implies Immobile.

'''Immobile''': Those performing the incantation cannot move more than 5 feet during the time required to perform the incantation and for the duration of the incantation; if they do, the incantation fails.

Each incantation also requires a certain amount of time to perform (generally more than one action). Since these are not spells, that does not trigger the need for concentration. Incantations that are not Group (2) or larger can be performed by multiple celebrants simultaneously. Having one or more extra participants reduces the time required by 1 step (see below) with a minimum of a full-round action. Each participant shares in the restrictions and penalties and must know the incantation to participate.

=== Time Steps ===
Full Round (takes effect at the beginning of the performer’s next turn, requires action, bonus action, and reaction and is interrupted by any damage) -&gt; 1 minute -&gt; 10 minutes -&gt; 1 hour -&gt; 4 hours -&gt; 8 hours -&gt; 24 hours.

== Incantations by Rarity ==

=== Common Incantations ===

==== Alarm ====
''Common, 10 minutes, duration 8 hours.''

As the spell.

==== Animal Friendship ====
''Common, Full round, Exclusive.''

As spell, with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. No upcast.

==== Animal Messenger ====
''Common, 1 minute, Exclusive, Costly (Special).''

As the spell, see special note.

Special: By burning a sachet of costly herbs worth at least 10 gp while performing this incantation, you can extend the duration by 24 hours for the first 10 gp worth of herbs and 24 hours for every 50 gp of herbs after that.

==== Arcane Lock ====
''Common, 1 minute, Exclusive, Costly (25 gp of gold dust)''

As the spell.

==== Augury ====
''Common, 10 minutes, Focus (as spell), Special (see text).''

As spell.

==== Continual Flame ====
''Common, 1 minute, Costly (ruby dust worth 50 gp), Cooldown (1 hour)''

As the spell.

==== Enthrall ====
''Common, Full round (see text), Focus (a gold pendant worth at least 100 gp).'' 

You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. Any creature that can’t be charmed succeeds on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target is blinded and deafened to all creatures other than you until one minute has passed or you stop performing the ritual (by incapacitation or otherwise). Once the effect ends for a target, they cannot be affected by it for 48 hours regardless of the source.

(Editor’s note: this one’s been buffed, heavily)

==== Extradimensional Refuge [Rope Trick] ====
''Common, 1 minute, Debilitating (1)''

As the spell

==== Floating Disk ====
''Common, 10 minutes, Immobile'' 

As the spell.

==== Gentle Repose ====
''Common, Full round, Costly (2 cp).''

This incantation prevents the decay of corpses for 10 days, prolonging the time over which the Resurrection incantation can be performed while still counting as an uncommon effect. This also increases the time that the Revivify spell will work. While in effect, it also prevents the raising of the target as undead.

==== Gift of Tongues, Lesser [Comprehend Languages] ====
''Common, Full round action, Costly (a small fish worth 1 gp)''

As the spell.

==== Identify ====
''Common, 10 minutes, Focus (as spell).''

As the spell.

==== Illusory Script ====
''Common, 10 minutes, Costly (a lead based ink worth at least 10 gp)''

As the spell.

==== Lockbreaker’s Boon ====
''Common, 1 minute, Exclusive.''

One creature touched gains proficiency with Thieves Tools for 10 minutes. If the target already had proficiency, they gain expertise instead. The incantation also creates a set of thieves tools made of solid force. When these tools are used on a door that was locked via Arcane Lock, the magical lock is suppressed for the duration of the attempt.

==== Magic Aura ====
''Common, 10 minutes, Costly (silk worth 10 gp)''

As the spell. Note: This does allow bypassing such things as glyphs of warding keyed to creature type.

==== Magic Mouth ====
''Common, 10 minutes, Costly (10gp, a small bit of honeycomb and jade dust)''

As the spell, with the following paragraph added.

The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions (the mouth has passive perception of 10 and no special senses such as darkvision) that occur within 30 feet of the object and cannot be triggered by another magic mouth effect. Triggering circumstances that involve significant logic may be rejected by the GM.

==== Mending ====
''Common, 1 minute.''

As the spell

==== Purify Food and Drink ====
''Common, 10 minutes''

As the spell.

(Editor’s note: I’m fine with spamming this, since it’s a ritual anyway).

==== Restoration [Lesser/Greater Restoration] ====
''Common (see text), Variable time (see text), Costly (see text).''

This incantation removes afflictions. The power depends on the time spent and the components expended:

Lesser Restoration (Full round, diamond dust worth 10 gp): The creature touched at the end of this ritual is cured of one disease afflicting it or one of the following conditions: blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

Greater Restoration (1 hour, 100 gp of diamond dust, requires 5th level): The creature touched at the end of this ritual either reduces their exhaustion level by one or has one of the following effects ended:

* One effect that charmed or petrified the target
* One curse, including the target’s attunement to a cursed magic item
* Any reduction in one of the target’s ability scores
* One effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum 

==== Unseen Servant ====
''Common, 10 minutes, Costly (1 gp).''

As the spell, although it cannot take any action that would directly or foreseeably cause damage to another creature (as decided by the GM, although rejected courses of action won’t burn its turns). Intent: This is a noncombatant and can’t directly help you in combat.

==== Voice the Voiceless [Speak with Animals, Speak with Plants, Speak with Dead] ====
''Common (see text), 10 minutes, Debilitating (1, see text)''.

As the appropriate spell. Speaking with the dead requires level 5 and imposes Debilitating (1); the other options do not.

==== Water Breathing ====
''Common, 10 minutes, Exclusive''

As the spell

==== Water Walk ====
''Common, 10 minutes''

As the spell

=== Uncommon Incantations ===

==== Abjure Espionage [New] ====
''Uncommon, 1 minute, Exclusive, Debilitating (1)''

You ward a 30’ sphere around you against spying magics for 1 hour. Any spell or effect that would allow someone not in the area to see or hear the interior fails; no sound or vision can see into the area from the outside.

Special: if you expend a pearl worth at least 100 gp while performing this incantation, you can instead cause any foiled scrying attempt to see or hear a scene that you designate when you cast the spell. This scene can last up to 10 minutes, after which it loops to the beginning.

==== Augment Fertility [Plant Growth, partial] ====
''Uncommon, 8 hours, Cooldown (1 week), Location (the place to be enriched)''

You enrich the land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on your location become enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.

==== Clairvoyance ====
''Uncommon, 10 minutes, Focus (a focus worth at least 100 gp, either a jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing), Costly (herbs and incense worth 25 gp), Immobile.''

As the spell, except that a creature that can see the sensor can attack and destroy it (AC 10, 1 HP, immune to all damage from anything but attacks)

==== Create Food and Water ====
''Uncommon, 1 minute, Costly (45 sp), Exclusive, Cooldown (1 day)''

As the spell

==== Divination ====
''Uncommon, 10 minutes, Costly (incense and an appropriate sacrificial offering worth at least 25 gp), Cooldown (8 hours).''

As the spell, except strike the last paragraph and note that while the answer will be truthful, it will be worded in a way to suit the entity’s interests, which may not be identical to your interests.

==== Dream Messenger [Dream] ====
''Uncommon, 10 minutes, Focus (a body part, lock of hair, nail clipping, or some similar portion of the intended target).''

This incantation shapes a creature's dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this incantation. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, can't be contacted by this incantation. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can't take actions or move.

If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the incantation. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the incantation early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the incantation, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the incantation) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target's dreams.

The target is aware of the identity of the messenger and can choose to reject the message. If they do so, the incantation immediately ends.

==== Find the Path ====
''Uncommon, 10 minutes, Focus (as spell).''

As the spell.

==== Gift of Tongues, Greater [Tongues] ====
''Uncommon, 10 minutes, Focus (a golden tongue worth 100 gp)''

As the spell.

==== Instant Summons ====
''Uncommon, 10 minutes, Costly (sapphire worth 1000 gp)''

As the spell.

==== Legend Lore ====
''Uncommon, 1 hour, Focus (as spell), Costly (as spell).''

As the spell.

==== Nondetection ====
''Uncommon, 10 minutes, Costly (as spell), Exclusive.''

As the spell.

==== Perceive Aura [Detect Evil and Good + Detect Magic] ====
''Uncommon, 1 minute, Focus (a small clear crystal worth 10 gp), Concentration''

You open your senses to the environment. While concentrating as if on a spell for up to 10 minutes, you perceive auras around each creature and magical effect or object you can see. The strength and shape of the aura reveals information about the entity it surrounds, as follows. Auras of items in the possession of creatures tend to blend into the creature's aura unless the item is much more powerful than the creature, in which case the reverse is true.

'''Creature Type''': Different creature types have different auras. Beasts, monstrosities, plants, and oozes have fuzzy, indistinct auras that cannot be distinguished from one another. Humanoid and giant auras are indistinguishable. Each other creature type has a distinct aura. No further scrutiny is needed to determine the type of a creature you can see.

'''Power Level''': More powerful creatures and effects/items have stronger auras than weaker ones. By focusing on an aura for a full round, you can determine the following (depending on the type of entity):

* relative CR (compared to your level). You know whether it is Much Weaker (CR &lt; level / 2), Weaker (level / 2 &lt; CR &lt; level), Stronger (level &lt; CR &lt; 2 * level), or Much Stronger (CR &gt; 2 * level).
* Item rarity
* Spell level equivalent

'''More Details:''' By focusing on an aura for one full minute, you can read more information about the nature of the creature. You learn one of the following of your choice

* Whether the creature can cast spells and, if so, what general type (divine, primal, harmonic, or arcane)
* Presence of outside magical influences (domination, suggestion, possession, curses, etc.) on creatures
* An approximate idea of the type of magic (spell school, hostility, etc.) of an item or effect

==== Phantom Steed ====
''Uncommon, 10 minutes, Exclusive.''

As the spell

==== Private Sanctum ====
''Uncommon, 1 hour, Exclusive, Debilitating (1)''

As the spell, without an upcast option.

==== Rapid Fortifications [Wall of Stone] ====
''Uncommon, 10 minutes, Cooldown (10 minutes), Immobile''

A non magical, permanent wall of solid stone forms at a point you choose within 120 ft over the duration of the incantation. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten 10-foot- by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick. If the incantation is interrupted, the wall disappears.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this incantation to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.

If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.

The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the GM's discretion.

==== Resurrection (Raise Dead, Resurrection, True Resurrection) ====
''Uncommon, Time varies (see text), Costly (see text), Group (see text), Location (see text)''

This ritual is capable of restoring life to the dead. The cost and requirements depend on the condition of the target. The target must be a creature that did not die of old age and is not undead. Mortal wounds are healed, as well as any disease or poison that affected the target.

If the target has been dead less than 10 days and the body is intact, this ritual counts as an Uncommon incantation, with a minimum casting level of 5. Enacting this incantation requires an hour of casting and consumes 500 gold pieces worth of diamonds but no other requirements.

If the target has been dead more than 10 days but less than 100 years, this ritual counts as a Rare incantation with a minimum casting level of 11. Enacting this incantation requires 8 hours of casting and consumes 5,000 gold pieces worth of diamonds. Unless performed in a sanctified location or by a cleric with the Life domain, enacting this form requires Group (2).

If the target has been dead for more than 100 years or the body is destroyed, this ritual counts as a Legendary tier incantation with a minimum casting level of 17. Enacting this incantation requires a group of 4 eligible casters, 24 hours, and 15,000 gold pieces worth of diamonds. Unless one of the participants is a cleric with the Life domain or the incantation is performed in a sanctified location (via the hallow location incantation), the target cannot regain hit points or spell slots for 8 days and all participants and the target gain 2 levels of exhaustion. This weakness can be removed by greater restoration or wish.

==== Secure Shelter [Tiny Hut] ====
''Uncommon, 10 minutes, Immobile''

As the spell, with the following proviso. The dome of force is an object with an AC of 10 and a damage threshold of 10 + half the performer's level. Any attack or effect dealing more damage to the dome than this forces the performer of the incantation to make a Constitution saving throw as if he were concentrating on a spell and had taken that amount of damage. On a failed save, the dome vanishes.

==== Sending ====
''Uncommon, Full round, Costly (gold-inlaid feathers of a blue bird worth at least 10 gp), Cooldown (1 hour)''

You send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like manner immediately. The incantation enables creatures with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive. The cooldown applies per sender.

Special: If both you and the target are willing, you can prolong the conversation by adding Debilitating (N), where N is 1 for every additional 25 word (in each direction) segment. Note: this does not impose penalties on this conversation, but does on any subsequent performances before you finish a long rest. The hearer also suffers this penalty if they attempt the ritual again before finishing a long rest.

==== Sense Location [Locate Animals or Plants, Locate Creature, Locate Object] ====
''Uncommon, Full round, Debilitating (1), Focus (see text).''

Choose either a type of animal or plant, a specific creature familiar to you, or an object that is familiar to you. The details are as the appropriate spell.

Animal or plant: Requires a focus of a carving of an animal or plant.

Creature: A carving of an eye worth at least 25 gp.

Object: A short forked stick.

==== Spell Trap (Glyph of Warding) ====
''Uncommon, 1 hour, Costly (500 gp), Immobile''

As the spell, but with the following conditions:

* The incantation cannot be performed in a demiplane or other extraplanar space. If the object on which it is inscribed is moved into such an extraplanar space, the effect immediately ends without being triggered.
* The glyph has no special senses and passive perception 10, but can detect creature types.
* If the Spell Glyph option is taken, the spell stored must either deal damage or conjure a creature hostile to the one who triggers it.

(Editor’s note: As noted by the name change, this is a trap, not a buffing device).

==== Telepathic Bond ====
''Uncommon, 10 minutes, Group (2-8).''

As the spell

==== Teleportation Circle ====
''Uncommon, 10 minutes, Costly (as the spell), Cooldown (8 hours), Immobile''

As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence--a string of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it for 1 minute.

(Editor’s note: note the absence of the option to make permanent circles. That’s a plot/worldbuilding thing IMO.)

==== Teleport Trap [New] ====
''Uncommon, 1 minute, Exclusive, Debilitating (1)''

You ward an area up to 1000 sq ft by 20’ tall against teleportation for 24 hours. Choose one of the options below:

* When a creature attempts to teleport out of or within the area, they must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, they are teleported to an area you designate and stunned for one minute. Stunned targets can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the stun effect on a save. On a success, the teleport succeeds normally but you are aware that it happened.
* When a creature attempts to teleport into the warded area, they must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, they instead are shunted to a false destination (see the Teleport mishaps table). On a success, the teleport succeeds normally but you are aware that it happened and the creature does not appear until 1 minute after it should have normally appeared.

==== Transport via Plants ====
''Uncommon, 1 minute, Immobile''

As the spell

==== Zone of Truth ====
''Uncommon, 1 minute, Immobile.''

As spell, with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.

=== Rare Incantations ===

==== Awaken Intelligence [Awaken] ====
''Rare, 8 hours, Costly (agate worth 1000 gp), Immobile, Debilitating, Major (3)''

As the spell

==== Binding Circle [Planar Binding] ====
''Rare, Costly (a jewel worth at least 1000 gp), Immobile, Location (a prepared ritual circle large enough for the target creature), Exclusive, 1 hour. Duration 24 hours.''

With this incantation, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the entire casting of the spell inside the prepared ritual circle. At the completion of the casting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. On a failed save, it is bound to attempt a single task you specify at the end of the casting. If the creature was summoned or created by a spell, the other spell immediately ends but the creature does not disappear until the incantation expires.

A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its ability. You might command the creature to guard a location, assassinate a target, or to deliver a message. The task must have a clear, fixed end condition and cannot be changed once assigned. The creature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

A creature bound in this way cannot be bound again for a full year and a day after completing their binding. As binding a creature in this way involves compelling them by the True Words that comprise their essence, a very uncomfortable and agonizing process, creatures bound this way are almost invariably unfriendly to the performer after being released.

'''Note''': The specificity of the task is a conversation between you and the GM. The intent is to make it clear when the task is over and avoid open-ended tasks.

'''Special''': By increasing the sacrifice, you can increase the duration of the binding. If you sacrifice a gem (or gems) worth 10,000 gp, it lasts for 10 days, 50,000 gp buys you 30 days, 200,000 gp buys you 180 days, and a sacrifice of gems worth 500,000 gp buys you a year and a day.

==== Commune [Commune, Commune with Nature, Contact Other Plane] ====
''Rare, 10 minutes , Immobile, Location (See Text), Cooldown (see text).''

You commune with a deity, primal spirits, or an non-deific otherworldly entity.

'''Deity''':  You can ask up to three yes or no questions. You receive an honest answer, but the deity is not guaranteed to know the answer. Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity’s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity’s interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.

This incantation requires a pre-existing relationship with a deity and an environment attuned to the deity in question (such as a shrine, consecrated location, or the presence of holy symbols of that deity). Contacting this same deity again before completing a long rest angers the deity and they will refuse to answer.

'''Primal Spirits (Nature)''': As the spell ''commune with nature''. Nature spirits are capricious, and communing again before moving out of range of the initial communion (ie 3 miles outdoors or 300’ in caverns or underground settings) results in at least one lie.

'''Other entity''': As the spell ''contact other plane''. Each time you perform this ritual again before finishing a long rest increases the DC of the saving throw by 5. The answers will generally be honest, but may be misleading.

==== Extradimensional Mansion [Magnificent Mansion] ====
''Rare, 10 minutes, Focus (1500 gp), Immobile''

As the spell

==== Fabricate ====
''Rare, 1 hour, Debilitating (2), Costly (Special)''

You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool. If you are creating an item out of metal, the metal must have been refined from ore previously.

Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the incantation is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials. No matter what you create, you can only create a single object at a time, and the entire object must be created out of the same material.

Creatures or magic items can't be created or transmuted by this incantation. You also can't use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship such as jewelry, exotic weapons (such as firearms), glass, or fitted armor (plate or half-plate).

'''Special''': The costly component required is that the amount of materials required is 150% of the amount of material used in the final product.

==== Fly ====
''Rare, 1 minute, Exclusive, Debilitating (1)''

As the spell, except that it affects 4 creatures. Special: If you take 10 minutes and expend a golden feather worth 100 gp, it can affect up to 8 creatures.

==== Forbiddance ====
''Rare, Focus (as spell), 1 hour.''

As the spell.

==== Guards and Wards ====
''Rare, 1 hour, Cooldown (12 hours), Focus (as the spell)''

As the spell

==== Hallow ====
''Rare, 24 hours, Group (2), Debilitating (Major, 2), Costly (as the spell)''

As the spell, with the following proviso: Clerics and paladins in good standing ignore the immediate debilitating effect, treating it as Debilitating (2) instead.

==== Modify Memory ====
''Rare, Full round, Focus (a gold and clockwork pendant worth at least 1000 gp), Immobile, Debilitating (Major, 1)''.

As the spell, no upcast option. DC of 17. A creature who makes the save or has the effect end cannot be affected again.

==== Planar Ally ====
''Rare, Immobile, Special (requires a pre-existing relationship with the entity providing the ally), Exclusive, Costly (see text). 1 hour.''

As the spell, with the following additions: 

* the one beseeching the aid must have a pre-existing relationship with the entity beseeched
* All tasks must have a clearly-defined duration and terms. Throughout its service, it acts as it sees fit and is not under your control, although it will follow through on the bargain to the best of its ability.

==== Plane Shift ====
''Rare, 1 minute, Focus (as the spell), Cooldown (1 day)''

As the spell.

==== Programmed Illusion ====
''Rare, 1 minute, Cooldown (8 hours), Focus (as spell)''

As the spell.

==== Shadow Creation [Creation] ====
''Rare, 10 minutes, Focus (Special), Exclusive, Costly (Special)''

As per the spell.

'''Special''': The focus is a small piece of the material being used. The cost of the component necessary depends on what is being made and can be any item with the indicated value (including currency or gems). If the object is made of multiple materials, use the most expensive.

* Vegetable Matter: No cost.
* Stone or Crystal: 10 gp
* Precious metals: 50 gp
* Gems: 100 gp
* Adamantine or mithral: 500 gp

==== Scrying ====
''Rare, 10 minutes, Focus (as spell). Cooldown (1 hour).''

As the spell.

==== Teleport ====
''Rare, 1 minute, Cooldown (8 hours), Immobile'' 

As the spell

=== Very Rare Incantations ===

==== Antipathy/Sympathy ====
''Very Rare, 1 hour, Cooldown (1 day), Exclusive''.

As the spell.

==== Earthquake ====
''Very Rare, 1 minute, Group (4), Debilitating (Major, 3)''

As the spell, with DC 17 for any necessary saves.

==== Mind Blank ====
''Very Rare, 1 minute, Debilitating (3)''.

As the spell.

==== Project Image ====
''Very Rare, 1 hour, Focus (as the spell), Cooldown (1 day)''

As the spell.

==== Tidal Wave [Tsunami] ====
''Very Rare, 10 minutes, Group (4), Debilitating (3), Location (requires a body of water within range)''

As the spell, with the DC changed to a flat 18. The wall diminishes at a rate of 30’, not 50’ per round.

=== Legendary Incantations ===

==== Astral Projection ====
''Legendary, 8 hours, Group (2-8), Debilitating (5), Costly (as spell), duration as spell.''

As spell, except that damage done to your astral form also damages your real body. You still awaken at 0 HP. Each person affected must participate in the incantation and acts separately in astral form (and can end the effect for themselves as an action).

==== Gate ====
''Legendary, 1 hour, Costly (a diamond worth at least 5000 gp), Cooldown (1 day)''

You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for one minute.

The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.

Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.

==== Irresistible Summons [Gate] ====
''Legendary, 1 hour, Group (4), Costly (a diamond worth at least 5000 gp), Cooldown (1 day)''

When you perform this incantation, you speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn't work). If that creature is on a plane other than the one you are on, a portal up to 20 feet in diameter opens in the named creature's immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.

Deities and other planar rulers can prevent this incantation from working on any creature in their presence or anywhere in their domains.

==== Total Transformation [True Polymorph] ====
''Legendary, 24 hours, duration special, Exclusive, Location (a prepared ritual circle)''

Choose one creature. It must remain in the circle for the duration of the caster.  At the conclusion of the incantation, the target is transformed into another creature or into a non-magical object (as described below). An unwilling creature can make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw, and if it succeeds, it isn’t affected by this incantation.

'''Duration''': The effect lasts until dispelled (counts as a 9th level spell) or unless the target is reduced to 0 HP, in which case it reverts to its original form with any excess damage carrying over. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.

'''Creature into Creature''': If you turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its level, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating), but cannot be a specific unique individual. The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the new form, although it does not gain any of the listed equipment. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

'''Creature into Object'''. If you turn a creature into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that form, as long as the object’s size is no larger than the creature’s size. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the effect ends and it returns to its normal form. Damaging the object in any way (including any alteration to its form) ends the spell immediately.

      <text bytes="2444" sha1="36j9xksdsle4h97l9tx08rw20nnbeou" xml:space="preserve">The most mixed, progressive significant town in the [[Uulan Confederacy]]. Founded originally in 185 AC when explorers in the [[Uulani Underground]] discovered a natural spring and opening that led to the southern face of the [[Outer Border Range]]. As no one felt comfortable leaving an open back door at ground level, the Uulan clan took responsibility for founding and staffing a fort. It stayed small and quiet until after the [[Crystal Spire War]] and especially after the formation of the [[Uulan Confederacy]]. After the departure of the more forward-thinking dwarven clans to found [[Shinevog]], a desire to not lose all progress gripped the Council of Paragons. They declared that the fortress, now known as Harmony, would serve as the site of a new town--one explicitly founded as a clan-free experiment. Malcontents, starry-eyed dreamers, Those are directed toward Harmony.

In the last 10 years or so, since the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]] became so fanatical, a large number of exiles from that theocracy have travelled through the intermountain wastes and settled near Harmony. This makes the town roughly half-and-half human/dwarven; the neighboring settlement of Devotion is mostly human (and once was a "training camp" for those convicted of not fitting into the HKR).

== Demographics ==
Population: ~2500, roughly 50/50 human/dwarven.

Industry: Farming and ranching. Due to the more temperate (although still harsh) climate, it is one of the only native sources of food year-round for the Confederacy.

== Leadership ==
Elected Mayor: Darvin of Fieldtown. Human male, ~45 years old.

Town Council: 15 other individuals elected by the populace. Any individual is allowed to speak at their public meetings. All business is conducted by majority vote.

== Amenities ==
Inns/Taverns:

* The Red Rock Tavern is an oddity--it's a combination of a tavern, a brewery, and a music venue. Run by one of the only folks from outside the HKR/UC area--a jazuu woman named Ulgah from the [[Tuura Adam]] (now estranged). She plays a mean tuba.
* The Woke-Right Inn, run by a dwarven couple (Alma and Aerith). Two stories.

Blacksmithy: Struck Stone Steel, run by a married dwarf/human couple, Sari and Selma (both women).

[[Ironshroud]] outpost (1 squad), led by Sergeant Xekka Uulan-Fuar.

General Goods Merchant: Wayfarer's Drygoods, run by a member of the Rauviz Merchant Consortium.

It specifically applies to [[Varieties of Magic|arcane]] magic, although it claims that the principles are more broadly applicable.''

Friends, colleagues, Imperial Guests. My topic today is on the 8 Laws of Magic. What is a Law? Is it something set by a Power, whether a god, an ascendant, or even by the universe itself? Nay. A Law, in this context, is a description of observed reality. Laws of reality cannot be broken; they can only be rewritten by a Wish at the change of an Age. These laws, specifically, govern ''magic''. What, then, is magic?

== Magic ==
Magic in this context is ''manipulation of aether to produce effects that have either a low probability of occurring in that situation or cannot exist at all.'' No one calls it magic that a hawk flies, even though that necessarily involves manipulation of aether (in light of the Law of Unity). But when a mage chants a few words, makes some hand gestures and begins to fly himself...''that'' is magic. As is the arts of the dedicant [''editor: what we now call a monk''] or the uncanny durability of a raging primalist [barbarian]. Mostly we think of ''spells'' and enchanted items as being magic; there is much more magic around us all. We live in a magical world.

== Laws ==
The eight Laws of Magic are divided into two groups: First, the Laws of Being, relating to the static nature of magical phenomena. These are the Law of Unity, the Law of Similarity, the Law of Inherent Cost, and the Law of Contagion. Second, the Laws of Becoming, those laws that describe transformations between aspects of Being.

=== Law of Unity ===
Summarized, this law says that all things are made out of the same thing. [[Anima]], also called aether. All the diversity of matter, energy, motion, souls, and everything else around us is but variations in aspects applied to matter. As a consequence, these Laws apply to all matter in like manner.

=== Law of Similarity ===
Like affects like stronger than like affects unlike. This Law reflects the truth that the strongest effects result from building on existing foundations. By contrast, forcing something against its basic nature tends to weaken the magic.

=== Law of Inherent Cost ===
Any transformation between aetheric aspects consumes aether in proportion to the dissimilarity of the starting and ending conditions and in proportion to the scale of the effect. Any mage casting a spell consumes their own personal aether and diminishes the blanket of diffuse aether on which the spell acts. While one can create matter "from nothing", the drain on the world's anima is ''greater'' than the quantity of matter produced. Only the action of mortal souls as they learn and grow, via ineffable means, can create aether. No magic can create more than it consumes.

=== Law of Contagion ===
Objects once in contact remain connected. The part affects the whole. This is the principle upon which communication stones work; the principle behind the Naming of Entities. Generally, magics that take place at range are weaker than ones that take place in contact (all else being equal).

=== Transformation Laws ===
These laws reflect the cycle of the elements and are interrelated. The first Transformation Law describes the cycle; the second and third are oppositions, and the fourth discusses non-elemental transformations

# Earth fuels fire, fire energizes wind, wind moves water, water softens earth. In return, earth fixes water in place, water gives substance to wind, wind gives breath to fire, and fire hardens earth.
# Fire consumes water; water quenches fire.
# Air scatters earth; earth blocks out the air.
# As the luminosity of any elemental aspect increases, the similarity between the elements is maximized. As the luminosity of any elemental aspect is diminished, the differences become more stark.

Its location is not widely known to outsiders, although all reports put it near the mouth of the [[Kairen River]] as it empties into [[Lake Coy'in]] at the eastern edge of the [[Lupaus Plains]].

Outsiders are forbidden to approach the area, and ships on the lake report extensive reefs in the area which preclude further easy approach. That's not to say that adventurous individuals ''haven't'' approached...but none have returned. The [[Horse Clans]] guard their secrets jealously.

== Truth (252 AC) ==
Pyhin is located at the mouth of the [[Kairen River]] as was believed. It consists of clusters of [[Gnomes|gnome]] (Puuha) houses and winter homes/storage for the [[Horse Clans]] around a (now collapsed) temple/cave complex. After the demise of [[Vetel]], the illusion of rocks in the bay was banished, revealing a nice harbor. It has since become an area of significant commerce, cutting lots of travel off of the Wyrmhold/Crisial route...much to the dismay of the folks who lived along the Dragon Road.

Inhabited by three primary tribal groups of [[goblins]]--the Stonefire, the Red Hawk, and recently, the Stranglevine to the south (migrating away from the wildlands for reasons unknown).

The only significant settlement is the Trinity Trading Post where the Byssian Road splits into the Goblin Path (to [[Fort Hope]]) and the Dragon Path (heading north along the edge of the mountains to [[Byarmarsh]]). A tiny village, it's mostly just a fortified trading post and resting place for caravans, especially those waiting for the periodic escorted caravans across goblin territory.

The mount itself is distinguished by the Three Crones, three mountain peaks that rise head and shoulders above the rest of the terrain. While most of the range is ~3000 ft up from the sea, the Three Crones reach into the cloud layer--their true heights are unknown.

This area is highly under-explored due to the legends of strange creatures and well-attested records of extreme elemental and especially [[kami]]-centric activity in the region. It's said that the land itself there only barely welcomes mortals...

To the east are the Dead Fens, including a remnant pocket of Twisted corruption that has taken root.

The goal of this is to decouple resource recovery from in-game time and instead couple it to natural breaks in the narrative. It relies on two definitions: Scenes and Arcs.

== Definitions ==
A '''Scene''' is a set of interconnected events/challenges where everything is happening in the main game loop (narrate -&gt; act -&gt; resolve -&gt; narrate). If there's a notable gap or scenery change, it's probably a new scene. This includes things like "you walk on down the road for a while..." or "you set up camp and watches for the night" or "you hole up in this side room and take a breather, listening carefully for signs of patrols". Note that camping in the wilds is only a Scene transition. Every Scene contains at least one challenge--something that you could conceivably spend resources (spell slots, daily uses, HP, etc) to overcome. A challenge still counts as a challenge even if you bypassed it without spending resources.

An '''Arc''' is a set of Scenes (generally 2+, but not always) that ends with the party in a safe, fortified spot. Somewhere where they don't need to set up watches or significantly worry about threats. It's unlikely to have an Arc transition inside a dungeon unless everything's dead there. Even ''tiny hut'' doesn't fully provide a safe spot, since it can be taken down by various means. This means camping in the wild doesn't count as an Arc transition unless you have enough people with you that the party doesn't need to take watch (so camping in a military camp might work, even if the camp moves). Often, Arc transitions are coupled with downtime.

== Resource Recovery ==
Between Scenes of the same Arc, you get the benefit of a Short Rest. Between the last Scene of one Arc and the first Scene of the second Arc, you get the benefits of a Long Rest.

=== Exceptions ===
There are some magic items, boons, and class features that can provide resource recovery during a Scene. For example:

* The potion known as [[Apprentice's Friend]] provides the benefits of a short rest as long as you're not in active combat, but cannot be used more than once per Arc per PC (as it's horrifically addictive).
* The blessings of the gods have been known to grant partial or full benefits of a Long Rest during a scene.
* &lt;potential&gt; class features for monks, fighters, and warlocks could grant a SR in the middle of a Scene; similar features for other classes might restore Rage uses, spell slots, etc during Scenes or recover some LR resources on a SR (such as Arcane Recovery).

This greasy-looking black liquid comes in pint-sized jars and has a bitter, almost burnt taste and smell. Drinking this potion requires spending 10 consecutive actions over the course of a minute. This potion cannot be administered to someone else. At the end of that time the drinker gains the benefit of a Short Rest. An individual character can only benefit from this effect once between any two consecutive long rests.

'''Access''': This potion can generally be purchased in small quantities in cities that host schools of the Arcane, as it is the traditional aid of struggling junior apprentices (hence the name).

'''Formula''': One pound of blackjuice pods, 0.5 oz of wake-me-up powder (uncommon), and water. Alchemy or Culinary proficiency.

== Basic information ==
Lamies [LAH-mees] was a ranking elemental prince of Air pre-[[Planar realignment]] who rose to leadership in the [[Plane of Cloud]] in the aftermath of the [[Cataclysm]]. He rose to power based on his subtle manipulations of those around him.

Lamies is most associated with dreams; other titles he is known by include

* Dream-lord
* Nightmare walker
* Lord of the Forgotten

His most common title "the Silent" comes from the fact that no one has (on record) heard him speak. Interactions with him happen by an odd empathic semi-telepathy. Mostly, people in his orbit tend to "just know" what he wants. Occasionally, he shows up in people's dreams and "speaks" there...although no one remembers what his voice sounds like.

Physically, he appears like a vaguely elven (although not any particular subtype) male of indeterminate age with blond hair and green hair.

== Expert information ==
According to ''Dreams of the Cloud: Lamies Nightmare-walker'', found in the Recursive Library, Lamies is actually a telepathic, winged aelf originally from [[Perdatos]]. This means his true form is a tall (~7'), slightly hunched, leather-winged, pointed-ear, sallow skin, pointed-tooth "elf". His talent is walking through dreams--anyone who sleeps and dreams can have their visions invaded and manipulated by Lamies. 

He feeds, as it was, on the dreams and memories that mortals desire to forget. Unlike the [[Plane of Ice]], which holds on to grudges and memories, Lamies desires that people discard their unwanted memories. Seeking peace by releasing all that troubles you.

In this case, evidence of the existence of harpies is well-attested back into the 2nd age. And their structure matches fairly well with what you'd get if a Twisted-worshipping aelf biomancer with a particularly...odd...fetish took a goblin and a vulture and merged the two. --The Immortal Bard, ''Bestiaries of Legend''

You're a fine one to talk about elves and fetishes...although yours are more "is female and doesn't run away." -- Dovara Brightsong, head of the Bardic College at Kaelthia and descendent of the Bard himself.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Harpies are a rare species of monstrosity known to inhabit many of the waste and fringe lands of [[Noefra]] and other continents. They are roughly a cross between a goblinoid torso, arms/hands (although clawed) and upper legs and head and a vulture's wings and lower legs/claws. The males of the species (rarer than the females) have raptorial beaks as well; the females have fully goblinoid heads but sharpened carnivore teeth. Both sexes have aggressively exaggerated secondary sexual characteristics and external genitalia. They are obligate carnivores, although like dogs they can eat small amounts of grains and other vegetable matter.

Standing between 3'6" and 4' tall, with 6-8' wingspans, they are clumsy fliers and not particularly adept on land. As for intelligence, they are human-level with a particular aptitude for languages. Their carnivorous bent and dangerous song makes them outcasts in the civilized societies of the [[Federated Nations]]. While not kill-on-sight like undead, they are not welcome. As such, they gather in small flocks in uninhabited or tribal lands (especially along the southern reaches of the [[Windwalker Confederacy]]) where they can hunt small creatures. Many have gone full on into the worship of various malign powers including demons. These groups particularly like to prey on the small-folk, including goblins that they can lure over cliffs.

Temperamentally, they are generally cowardly but aggressive, with strong and often violent tempers. Finding clothes that fit them is difficult, and their lack of good manipulating members make them clumsy with tools. So they rarely bother with clothing or more than rudimentary weapons, relying on their claws, teeth, and (in the case of the females), their song. Their diet of meat (fresh or not) and lack of manipulators makes them often foul-smelling and covered in blood and other rancid matter, and their nests are frequently befouled as well with their own droppings. The males lack the musical capabilities and are less facile with spoken languages (due to their beak-like faces) and are often more aggressive than the females.

These properties are not inherent, however--there are a few legends of "well-kept" harpies who use their song for good and keep themselves clean and presentable. Those are not substantiated, however. Harpies are not known for magical or religious properties.

==== Harpy Song ====
Female harpies are born with the capacity to produce a bewitching magical song; those that cannot resist its pull are forced to walk ever closer until the harpy eviscerates them and begins feasting while the prey is still alive. They can tune the song to lure humanoid creatures or beasts, but not both with the same song.

==== Lifecycle ====
Harpies nest in groups of 2-3 females and 1-2 males, producing several eggs each year in late winter/early spring. These eggs are large, roughly the size of an ostrich egg, and hatch over the course of roughly 6 weeks. The child is born small and weak, with fuzzy feathers all over their backs. They have sharp teeth/beaks from birth as well as claws and talons. They mature rapidly, reaching adulthood within two years, at which most flocks kick them out. Casualties among the fledglings are quite high in the wild, with 1-2 out of 10 eggs producing adults. They pick up languages very fast--within the first two months they have learned to speak as well as whoever is raising them. They are voracious, eating their weight in fresh (or slightly decaying, they don't really care generally) meat every day.

Harpies live between 15 and 20 years if not killed much sooner by violence, starvation, or other causes. Most do not live beyond 5-10 years.

'''In-universe Timeframe:''' Early winter/late fall 251, current time is early spring 252.

'''People:'''

* [[Eskel]]
* [[Pyrrha Kelshanne]]
* [[Wan Tian Kuo]]
* [[Yonas Akrotiz]]

'''Events''':

* Late fall 251 AC:
** Party met at Rampant Gryphon Inn, at Crossroads, a merchant town ~ 5 mi outside of [[Rauviz City]]. Hired to guard [[3 Mountains, Inc.]] caravan to [[Fuar Uulan]].
** Passed through Folsom Village, which had committed murder-suicide in an attempted (although botched) blood magic ritual to "bring things back to normal".
** Rescued [[Naimanzuunnadin Tsetseg]] from kidnappers, recovered a [[Rune Anvil]] (the one formerly in [[Kaelthia]]), and helped him become Smith Exemplar of the Uulani dwarves.
* Early winter 251 AC:
** Participated in the Festival of Virtues. Lotsa drinking.
** Caught rumors of a place called [[Grimhold]], a lost dwarven city, and decided to investigate.
** On the road, encountered a number of interesting and hostile creatures. Rescued some deep gnomes of the [[Plane of Coal]], servants of the [[Gnoman]].
** Reached [[Grimhold]], encountered plant/fungus monsters and strange singing.
** Learned the sad and terrible secret of the clanhold's death.
** Defeated a [[Daughter Tree]], offspring in despair of the [[Mother Tree]], mother of hags, reclaiming the town.
** From there, headed south through [[Harmony (Town)|Harmony]], and then west to [[Guildtown]]. Discovered military buildup in the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]] but avoided detection.
* Mid and Late Winter 251 AC:
** At Guildtown, found the city under siege and snuck in.
** Participated in a raid on [[Kaelthia]], entering the [[Granite-Flame Academy]]. Found it to be under siege from celestial forces, with a few survivors holding out in the library. Assisted [[Katheryn Archmagus]] (or her spirit, anyway) in restoring the Lost Stacks and evacuating the people. Library now hidden away in a demiplane, out of reach of anyone.
** Guildtown evacuated.
** Headed to [[Crisial City]] for a concert by [[Dilligas Husty]].
** Got news of an impending attack by the [[Horse Clans]] against [[Vaeltaa]] and the eastern edge of [[Safehold]]. Went with Crisial Rangers and adventurers to assist. '''Note''': [[Holy Crusade|Holy Winter Crusade]] occurs at this time.
** Were sent on scouting mission into the [[Lupaus Plains]]. Discovered true goal of the invasion--to wipe out the clans in a furious blaze of blood magic so their "god" [[Vetel]] could Ascend as a demon prince.
** Visited several "Taboo" sites along the way, including making friends with a nice pond nymph. Defeated a Green Knight who had been imprisoned by the old Vetel for centuries who wanted to wipe all humanoid life from the plains.
** With some help from [[Wylda]] (incurring a debt), they freed the last Vessel from Vetel's control.
** Penetrated into the holy city of [[Pyhin]] and defeated Vetel herself. '''Discovered gnomes'''.
** Gifted fine horses. Also 3/4 (not Eskel) had liquor-enhanced omen dreams (relevant later).
** Began overland travel down back to [[Fort Hope]] and on to the [[Blood-thirst Wildlands]].
* Early spring 252 AC.
** Traveled into the wildlands. Encountered harpies, took an egg. Left one alive (that won't come back to bite anyone, certainly not).
** Traveled via [[Moonpath]] into the north-central wildlands. Took on a quest (to pay [[Wylda|Wylda's]] debt) to "fix" other moonpaths.
** Reached the [[Place of All Gods]], an ancient holy site with many temples.
** Faced a shadow dragon in the temple of flame, delved into an unholy vampiric/Twisted nest and destroyed some. Were only saved from the influence of [[Dark of the Moons]] by influence of stone elementals guarding a shrine to elemental earth. Destroyed that ancient corruptor.
** Visited the Temple of the Wanderer, learned about the 16-fold Great Cycle (relevant to [[Wan Tian Kuo]]).
** Fled west (to avoid the local forces' anger at destroying their "patron"), encountered the People, a cult-like group of shifters and goblins expanding in the area. Led by Basarab, a darkly-charismatic shifter and brother to Perra, high priestess of the Carmine Path.
** Cleaned a Moonpath south of [[Freeport]] by removing [[necrite]] shards from a fey tree. 
**After exiting, the harpy egg hatched into a female fey-aspected [[harpy]] chick. Kuo named her [[Wan Tien Cho|Wan Tian Cho]]. After [[Wylda|Wylda's]] intervention, she was delivered to the keeping of a pair of gnomes native to the [[Isle of Beasts]].
** From Freeport, headed into [[Southmount]] to investigate both the supposed Tomb mentioned in a dream of Yonas's, as well as the increasing earthquakes from one of the [[Three Crones]], the great mountains there.
** Discovered that the Skydragon, an ancient (like...early 2nd age) dragon who had bonded with the central Crone's spirit, was dying, running the risk of making a real mess of the area if it fell. '''Encountered [[Ryuukin|kobolds]]'''. Nice/cute fellows. Took up a quest to prevent the mountain from crumbling.
** Entered the [[Plane of Stone]] to seek aid (and go shopping).
**Gained the aid of several stone-aligned entities.
**With __, they discovered and cleared the Tomb of [[Korokonolkom]], the place where that entity ascended to the role of [[Elemental lord]]. Took many notes.
**Saved the Central Crone. '''Shockingly'''.
*Late Spring/into Summer 252 AC
**Took ___ up to [[Zhapai Karmap]] and then on to the [[Tuura Adam]], with a stop at the Halls of the Dead, where the finished the cleansing by freeing spirits trapped there.
**Also ran into [[Eskel]]'s adoptive family. It...didn't go well. More evidence of his past emerged.
**Cleansed the [[Titanwall]] at [[Kozhuyn]]
**Acquired the Jade Phoenix, which reacted very strongly to [[Pyrrha Kelshanne]], revealing that her fire-cat is actually part of the [[Firebird]] dwelling inside of her.
**Approached by two groups:
***[[Rhys]] of [[Tal Elamor]], who wished to hire them. They ended up accepting this invitation.
***The [[Circle of Purging Flame]], who wished to recruit them. They rejected this group.
**Discovered evidence of [[Pyrrha Kelshanne]]'s actual parents, as well as traces leading toward [[Eskel|Eskel's]] past. He grew into his markings and they got engaged.
*Working for Rhys, Summer 252 AC
**Asked to visit two volcanoes--one on the [[Isle of Fire]] to the north and one at the entrance to [[Moon's Vengeance]] and retrieve sensors.
**Took ship from [[Honedaxe]] with a group of scholars to [[Isle of Fire]].
**Found [[Pyrrha Kelshanne|Pyrrha Kelshanne's]] tribe, where her uncle had tried to sell them out. Also eventually met her parents. '''Didn't''' blow up a mountain. Making this somewhat of a pattern...
**Teleported to the wasted lands of the northern [[Moon's Vengeance]], where they met some lovely [[goroesi]] women.
**Rescued a ghost who is now possessing her own (magically-preserved) body.
**Met a bronze dragon. Also met and made a deal with an angry red dragon to humiliate the bronze in exchange for the sensor they wanted. Which they did. Including stealing his hoard and his followers. Dragon's not dead, last seen flying off in a rage.
**Turned the sensors over to Rhys, who turns out to be a lich.
*At some point here they went to the [[Plane of Cloud]] in an effort to get memories back. It only sorta worked.
*Traveled east to meet [[Pyrrha Kelshanne|Pyrrha Kelshanne's]] brother in [[Ocieli]], where they foiled a plot by the [[Circle of Purging Flame]] to break the barrier and release the [[Hagfen]]. Also killed [[Wan Tien Cho|Wan Tien Cho's]] harpy mother, now twisted into a siren-creature.
*Tried to go to [[Tal Elamor]], but ended up nope-ing out of demon area. Ended up in the [[Plane of Lava]].
*Plane of Lava, Late Summer 252 AC
**Found [[Eskel|Eskel's]] mom, as well as the woman who had "rescued" him from the Special School. Turns out it was all part of a plan by [[Alastor, World Judge]].
**Rescued slaves from a really nasty Cog Priest. Including [[Leilana of Tuatain]], who turned out to like [[Yonas Akrotiz]] a lot (and the feeling is mutual).
**Took slaves and mom back to the Kelshanne place. Wedding planning.
*Decided to take Leilana back home and investigate the place said to hold the key to stopping Yonas's nightmares. Stopped in [[Auringon]], where they met a story-obsessive dragon at the [[Elder Library]] and Kuo got sniped by an amorous princess/priestess.
*Headed north into the [[Lost Coast]]. Found the [[Lost Coast|Tuatain]] under threat from hag/demon-warped neighbors.
*Fought through shadow into the heart of the [[Black Tree]], one of the children of the [[Mother Tree]], which was broadcasting doom and paranoia and hate. Found its heart in the [[Abyss]] and defeated it, but not before [[Eskel]] made a deal with [[Nidus]] for some much-needed juice.
*Returned to Auringon, decided to try to qualify for land-holder status by doing a good deed.
*Into the Drowned Coast, Fall 252 AC.
**Headed south, obliterated a demon-worshiping tribe and rescued the slaves (sending them back to Auringon).
**Got thoroughly creeped out by the [[Tlalocana]], decided to head to the monster-infested hills instead.
**Found the [[Vale of Karmeth]], which had escaped the [[Cataclysm War]] by activating four [[necrite]] obelisks created originally by [[Nidus]], which had the effect of warping time around them.
**Successfully de-fused the time-warping ritual, returning the vale back to real-space
**Discovered that the Tlalocana are actually controlled by a network of many many [[Mkhulu]] bent on expansionist domination.
*Tal Elamor, Late Fall 252 AC into winter.
**Entered the Oubliette, a demiplane constructed by a mad mage who liked "jokes"...the kind that kill. Retrieved the [[Portal Network]] core for [[Tal Elamor]].
**Discovered that the artificers were making the MADman system, a mobile weapon that would use the portal network to lob retaliatory bombs. Told them it was a bad idea, but they didn't listen.
**Helped [[Rhys]] with his experiments and discovered that he was not alone in his body. Later discovered evidence that the [[jotnar]] inside of him had become sapient and free-willed, and was puppeting him.
**Discovered that someone acting in Rhys's name had started undermining the Primal Forest in search of the [[aether plague]] remnants. Defeated those undead agents.
**[[Wan Tian Kuo]] went to the [[Hall of Frozen Memory]] and got his memory back.
**Made allies with the rest of the leaders of the city.
**Worked to put together a cleansing mechanism leveraging the [[Firebird]]'s power.
***Required going to each of 4 elemental planes to attune to it.
***[[Eskel]] made a deal with [[Alastor, World Judge]] to become his ascended Hand.
***Made friends with a dragon turtle.
**Was made by [[Naimanzuunnadin Tsetseg]]
*Wedding planning and hijinks
*Kuo visited the [[Plane of Flame]] and ended the Great Cycle, choosing to live out his remaining life and ascending as a fire elemental devoted to helping 
*Showdown (winter 252 AC)
**Actively cleansed the remains of the [[aether plague]] in the Primal Forest of [[Tal Elamor]]. The archdruid and the jotnar were reborn as infants--[[Archibal Kelshanne]] and [[Bianca Kelshanne]] and adopted by [[Pyrrha Kelshanne]].
**Rhys acknowledged that he was possessed and assisted the party in sabotaging the elemental conduits feeding the phylactery, weakening Nihil (as the jotnar was named).
**1st of Winter Dying was both a test of MADman and Nihil's ascension ritual, becoming a "real boy" with an elementally-created artificial soul.
**As it turned out, MADman had been sabotaged to become actually active with live ammo, and Nihil opened portals to the [[Abyss]], leading to a demonic invasion. The party was involved in fighting Nihil and his undead/demon allies.
**Victorious, the party cleansed Nihil, which resulted in ... backlash.
**Rhys was permanently etched into his spellbook/phylactery, gaining some ability to sense his surroundings and telepathically communicate, but otherwise rendered harmless.
**Nihil was reborn in Rhys's (now teenage) body, minus any jotnar powers or memory. It's believed that he was reborn in the former [[Phoenix Empire]].
*Wedding, with guests
**It went well. [[Dilligas Husty]] played, [[Tsun Azur]] did security.
**Representatives of the demon princes, elemental lords, and congregation attended.
**[[Wylda]] tried to meddle with [[Wan Tian Kuo]]'s firstborn (which turned out to be twins). This was partially stopped by [[Kela Loran]]'s intervention.
*Afterlife
**Kuo and Yelena had 6 kids and ruled the area.
**Eskel and Pyrrha settled down, taught (druid grove and arcane school). Archibal becomes a druid (duh), and Bianca becomes a sorcerer/arcanist. Had one other kid who became a warrior.
**Yonas and Leilana had several kids, and Yonas worked with the burgeoning military of [[Byssia]], especially against the threat from [[Tlalocana]].

      <text bytes="4622" sha1="hjpg5dsy2zvq4kfzybhgv3hh0cr2pua" xml:space="preserve">Once a great tree spirit, Vetel consented (back before the 3rd age) to serve as the prison for the spirit of a vicious female druid who had learned to body-jump (becoming almost immortal that way). The tree turned to stone; not really alive in the normal sense. It was then enclosed in a great cave, deep underground. Locked into the tree by wards, this malevolent spirit would be incarcerated for eternity.

All was fine, and Vetel was a kind, benevolent being, eager to grant shelter to oppressed or homeless people. The wards extended its life by drawing on the strength of other kami and the demonic spirit was quiescent. Then came the Cataclysm. In the disruption attendant to that event, the wards cracked. Slightly. Not enough for the spirit to escape, but enough for its malevolence to infect Vetel. In its weakened state, it was unable to fight off the infection, and succumbed. As its last act, it locked a curse on the imprisoning wards. If the wards failed, they would implode and take the tree (and Vetel, dependent on the tree-spirit's vitality) with it. So now, Vetel, the ancient body-jumper, had a fixed form. This it did not like. But it waited.

A few years after the Cataclysm, a band of gnomes entered the caverns looking for shelter from the disasters unfolding. They found Vetel, who struck with them a deal. They would care for the tree and the wards and worship her as their goddess[1], and she would protect them. This deal was false--she had not the power to do this. But they didn't know it. She chose a vessel from the young gnomish women to become her "priestess", who would be overcome by her power and act as a mobile host for a portion of her ancient spirit (and a set of sense organs, for Vetel hungered for sensation). But gnomes weren't that satisfying. Too small, too serious, not glamorous enough. And being small, the vessels burned out fast.

A generation later, the ancestors of the wind elves arrived at Pyhin, running from a bad winter storm, and Vetel saw an opportunity. She struck a similar deal with them--they would worship her and she would protect them from the storms and from outside harm. Part of this deal was that now the "vessels" would be chosen from among the wind elves. Taller, glamorous, and most importantly compatible, they'd live much longer before deteriorating and would tolerate much greater separation from the main tree.

Important note: the people do not know that she is a possessing spirit. They see the vessels as being inspired by the goddess, not being soul-eaten. And the deterioration is a closely-held secret among the caretakers (all gnomes). To most people now, the vessel is ageless and eternally young.

Girls are chosen at about age 8 every year. They are trained in her service (satisfying the vessel's urges and catering to her every whim) and are brainwashed into true devotion, willing to die for the goddess. When the vessel is deteriorating (which happens unpredictably but rapidly), those of appropriate age (post-pubescent) are brought to her and she tries to inhabit them by turns, sticking in the first one that works. Failed candidates are taken to [[Talvi]] (secretly). If a candidate reaches the age of 18 without being tried, she's released from direct service and married off (becoming a priestess to the Clans). Those who experienced a transition (but weren't tried) are often mentally broken; the others don't remember much other than "bliss".

Vetel is addicted to sensation, especially sensual. She pulls young warriors from among the Clans and uses them, draining them dry and often torturing them. Their husks are discarded to Talvi. Her servants attend her constantly, keeping her in a state of arousal. She likes inflicting pain, especially psychological pain. This breaks many of them (who are discarded). She encourages "competition" (fighting, often with bloodshed) among her faithful.

[1] By being worshiped, Vetel has gained tremendous power. She's searching for a way to undo the curse. At present, she (in her vessel) can only wander so far--the big risk is when the vessel goes to Talvi. That portion is separate and can be broken free of the main host (for Vetel is now a composite entity containing the spirits and memories of all those who served as her vessels) if it doesn't return. Her power is mostly over illusions and perceptions.

== Destruction ==
Vetel was destroyed in late winter/early spring 251 by [[Ad Elementis]], seeking to stop the genocidal war she had unleashed to attempt to Ascend to the status of [[Demon Princes|Demon Prince]]

A [[Dwarves|dwarven]] master smith, eccentric, and iconoclast. Born in 147 AC, he has traveled extensively to perfect the arts of the forge (all of them). Widely considered a "wizard" at metal-craft. Strongly anti-traditional, he and his clan are at odds. He returned to [[Fuar Uulan]] and won the title of Smith Exemplar, much to the rest of the nation's consternation.

      <text bytes="3855" sha1="hotp4kmin9kuxm3y5m8kinvcib2pxz9" xml:space="preserve">Yonas grew up in the hills and highlands of northern [[Byssia]] just south of the Caldera. He started  drinking the spirit of the rye just after his 17th summer began. Pa and Uncle Furkun distilled it up in the highlands, high above the rolling terrain where their homestead was established.  Out of habit, and the success of sneaking a bit here and there, he acquired a taste for the spirit of the rye.  He did it to calm the nightmares.

Ma was more spiritually gifted than Pa, and tried to discover why Yonas had erupted into sleepwalking violence night after night.  He had no answer, which pleased her not.   She was a disciple of the [[Church of Night Reborn]]. The first nightmare had caused damage to the barn, where he slept with the oxen and the donkeys, to the extent of numerous boards being shattered as he battled dream demons that were not there.  The visions of disaster visited every night, unless the blessed rye chased them off. When the levy call came Father raised no objection to him being inducted into the regional militia.  The other four who entered had families who fought tooth and nail to keep them out, but the regional judges had ruled against them.

They were worked so hard that most nights the sleep of the exhausted precluded dream, but sometimes the disastrous visions returned. He learned who kept a flask of spirits in the pack, and how to acquire a dram here and there. On payday he always made sure to get a portion to keep the dreams away.

The March Wardens noticed his aptitude for battle and mayhem, and a knack for moving about unobserved, and offered him a place.

A March Warden!  The defenders of Byssia’s borders. For two years he roved, raided, fought and negotiated with them.  But as had become a habit he drank a bit too much.

In a hamlet outside of [[New Nocthia]] he broke the jaw of a bouncer at a tavern who didn’t care for the attentions that the barmaid, his sweetheart, lavished upon the strapping young man. That objection led to a brawl, and that brawl led to Yonas’ release. The captain handed him his last pay, and suggested the mercenary trade. “When you drink you can’t tell between enemies and the phantasms you wish to defeat.” He paused. “This is the third time you have done violence – thankfully non-fatal, which with your strength is always a risk – to someone who your mind’s eye painted as an enemy.” Before the next sunrise, Yonas headed east.  He caught on with a caravan braving the risks of the Windwalkers.  Nobody in that group minded his drinking, but when they reached the plains in the southwest of the Crisial Kingdom, his contract was not renewed.

His next job involved chasing down and killing cattle rustlers.  He was effective, but was once again given his pay, a bottle, and a kind invitation to head to a city, like Rauviz, where his talents would pay well and where he’d not be a bother to them.

Dry and dream-cursed for three days he arrived at the gates of [[Rauviz City|Rauviz]]. The pikemen at the gate asked his profession. “Sellsword and farmer.” The guard captain stepped out of the gatehouse, laughing. “We’ve no need of farmers here, lad, but someone will  want your axe under their command. Five silvers to enter, and know that we prefer combat within the city walls to be unarmed.” “Such a warm welcome, Captain, to your fair city.  What tavern would you suggest, for a man with a taste for the spirit of the rye?” His eyebrows rose slightly. “Seek ye the Sign of the Rampant Griffon.  You’ll find oblivion, spirit, and much else there.” He met Pyrrha, Kuo, and Eskel there, and they hired on as caravan guards.  And that’s how it all began, as Ad Elementis learned together how many threats to Noefra were lurking in corners, caves, and in plain sight.

      <text bytes="1896" sha1="17fpg61qazinoyli8c0hf1dg30pw9oy" xml:space="preserve">Eskel was only 10 when he was found by members of the Ukhel tribe. And was a strange sight: a mute, blonde haired boy covered in burns with strange markings along both his arms. He was adopted by Alara Ukhel, sister to the chief. Though he was mute for almost a year, he was sharp and a quick study, teaching himself several languages in an attempt to learn what his markings were while also. He later discovered a book of magic that fueled his desire to learn and opened a new avenue for him to explore his marks, though his growing arcane talents, obsession with the unknown and slight disregard for the tribe's rules, only made him more of a pariah in the tribe. So, when he was older, he left to see the rest of the world and hopefully discover his own history.

=== Personality ===
Eskel is a fairly calm and level headed person with a slight sarcastic streak that shows around the people he's close to. Though he does have a temper that reveals itself at times. He's also quite the introvert and gets very tense and nervous in larger cities and crowds, often shutting down unless distracted from his discomfort.

'''Bonds''': Keeps two books with him at all times: a journal(full of notes and drawings depicting everything he's learned and seen on his travels that he keeps to himself) and another that he uses for his spell-work. Loves nothing more than a good book. He also adores his adopted sister, Kaiya (Alara's daughter), who was the only person who seemed to understand him even when he didn't speak.

'''Ideals''': Hopes to learn the meaning and purpose behind the marks on his arms and why he was alone when found by the tribe.

'''Flaws:''' Has a near obsession with knowledge of any sort. The more obscure or magical, the better. This often leads him to make rash decisions, deals, or bargains that he otherwise wouldn't make.

      <text bytes="3829" sha1="154n8fvip0hj0t62q6y6u0jm1fbk95i" xml:space="preserve">Wan Tian Kuo was born an air-touched to a human couple in the western Shu province of the [[Jinse Empire]], and shortly after moved to the tribal lands of [[Chuvashka]] while still an infant. He and his older sister Wan Xiulan seemed to be healthy and happy, and enjoyed the great plains. His father Wan Qiqiang was a samurai (a Jinse semi-noble warrior), and his mother Wan Zhilan was a druid. Early on in their lives, their parents attempted to teach them fundamental skills in those arts. While His sister took to being a druid like their mother, Kuo showed minimal aptitude for either. He seemed most natural at using his bare hands. Throwing fire and dodging attacks rather than blocking, similar yet different than monks. Around the time of his eighth birthday, He began to suffer from nightmares. These often woke him up from phantom pain or in panic. Common themes included a giant pillar of fire, random scenes of monsters in odd places, and his own (mostly) violent deaths. Now, his father occasionally enjoyed a glass of strong liquor after a long day and Kuo was drawn to the smell of the substance. He found that sneaking and drinking it helped to ease the terrors that haunted him. While his parents were naturally furious with him, nothing kept him from the oh so wonderful healing spirits.

Over a decade and a half later, Kuo was well adapted to wandering the great plains of the Chuvashkan territory. Loved the wildlife and making friends with them. He knew where to avoid, where the best hunting spots were for food and water. He would take things back to the tribe to sell, only caring about having enough money to buy his alcohol. Until one day he was relaxing on one of his favorite hills and watching the clouds pass by, he spotted three massive looking birds flying overhead with riders. He knew they weren't dragons (he stayed away from moving past the southern border, where dragons were more common though he's never seen one). A sight he'd not seen before, but the rumors of some western adventurers did spread through the region by that point. He didn't think much of it until a few days later when the earthquakes started. The mountain in the dead walkers land had somehow, blown up (or in). He took this as a sign to follow his gut and finally leave the region. Saying goodbye to his parents, he finally began to wander where the wind took him. Ending up in the mountains above a dwarf owned city in the [[Uulan Confederacy]], he settled in a camp a mile or two outside and above the entrance. He took a number of odd jobs, made a name for himself as a heavy drinker among the dwarves, and landed a somewhat seasonal job of escorting a caravan to and from [[Rauviz]]. A year or two had passed as a regular caravan guard, and he was once again getting the itch to travel, and planned to depart after the last trip of the year. In Rauviz he met a few curious and strange individuals, got a new drinking buddy, and hoped they proved to be fun.

Spoiler alert, they did! Too bad he later found out his soul is on fire and keeps being reborn, and his nightmares involved watching the deaths of his past incarnations. 

'''Appearance''': Five foot eight inches tall, in sleeveless blue shirt and flowing pants. While once was barefoot, now wears somewhat bulky looking metal boots. Wild and tangled white hair, light blue skin, and grey eyes. 

'''Bonds''': His friends, the open skies, his harpy daughter Wan Chou, and fae fox Mystic 

'''Ideals:''' I have a primal need to see the world. I refuse to kill anyone who can talk, regardless if they are trying to kill me or not, as nobody truly deserves to die. 

'''Flaws''': Smells like both a brewery and body odor. Doesn't like to bathe much, as he wants animals to like him more if he smells natural.

      <text bytes="1897" sha1="3a4wwef3k1l8sgprg6dzyerw4gq11v2" xml:space="preserve">Pyrrha and her brother, Igni, were found in the north-eastern [[Dreamwall Mountains]] by Elder Luca Kelshanne, who adopted them. They were raised by Luca and Kela Rivan-Kelshanne, their father and papa respectively. Upon reaching maturity, the two participated in the Rite of Flame, which had to do with getting the Firebird’s blessing. 

In Pyrrha’s ritual, something happened to where the Firebird was gone and Igni disappeared. She’s trying to find out what happened and find Igni. Along the way, she met Eskel and grabbed him as a bodyguard/travel buddy. Eventually, she met Kuo and Yonas. She likes journalling and collecting plants/rocks/flowers to put in her journal of the places that she visits (pressing flowers). And she tries to connect to different trees (will help with Transport Via Plants) and wildlife where she goes. She wants to ‘try everything’, so she will often get into shenanigans with Kuo and Yonas. Despite her petite appearance, she is pretty strong. 

'''Appearance''': 5’5 petite woman with fair skin and reddish-orange hair. Often likes to put flowers in her hair if she can find them. She wears mariner reinforced leather armor that has some blue patterns. 

'''Bonds''': Friends, Igni, her dads, Wylda, elemental fox-kin Reed, and Cinder (Fire Cat) 

'''Ideals''': Pyrrha wants to find her brother and help her friends, but her ideals are to try everything. Being from a sheltered background, she wants to see everything and try new things. And help people. Everyone deserves help, beast or humanoid. 

'''Flaws''': She tends to enable people and avoid conflict in-party.

== Post-Campaign ==
Pyrrha married [[Eskel]] and has settled down as the druidic advisor to the [[Auringon]] rulers and as parent to the two odd-twins. She still maintains most of her role as the [[Firebird]]'s protective aspect.

They were working under the direction of the War core.

They were met at the pass through the cliffs by a force of militia, local goblin tribes, Wyrmhold engineers, and [[Half Measures]]. It went badly for them, in large part due to traps and archers. The frost giant leader was killed, the lobster-mecha "golem" was disabled, and the War core removed. This event caused the Shrikenest goblins to formally ally with Wyrmhold and the Hornet and Tuatha tribes to become much more friendly.

      <comment>Created page with "A predominantly [[Jazuu]] tribe in the south-western part of the [[Nocthian Caldera]], bordering [[New Nocthia]] slightly. Relatively unique among the Caldera natives in that..."</comment>

      <text bytes="4273" sha1="iodh7m6d7vq9ufq7qc1msi22zwdfwuy" xml:space="preserve">A predominantly [[Jazuu]] tribe in the south-western part of the [[Nocthian Caldera]], bordering [[New Nocthia]] slightly. Relatively unique among the Caldera natives in that they are almost completely settled and agricultural, rather than pastoral or migratory. Their tribe name translates roughly (from an Oelfran Too-til dialect) to "Threefold", which matches their comparatively unique religious beliefs.

== Symbols ==
The Jaruud banner is a silver chevron, point up, with a black circle underneath. Usually on a blue field. The vertices of the chevron represent their three-fold "deity"; the black circle is the (unnamed normally) "Unmaker", their "evil" antagonist "deity".

== Demographics ==
The Jaruud are one of the more populous tribal groups, numbering about 15,000 people, of which the vast majority are Jazuu. While they have a few remnant giants, they do not worship/revere them like the Oronar do. Some of the local goblins, especially from the Fenfoot, have sought protection under the Jaruud banner.

About 1/3 the population lives in or around Jaru Tor, a town built on the (relatively well-preserved) ruins of a Nocthian city in the south-east portion of their territory. Located on a set of hilltops, the city was spared the worst of the Frost's ravages and was rebuilt during that time as a logistics center; Aela, the former administrator of the center became the first leader of the Jaruud after the fall of the Frost. Now very elderly, she is the Crone of the Three.

The Jaruud, due to their superior organization mostly, have become the fastest growing tribe in the region. Several smaller jazuu tribes to the west have already been absorbed, mostly peacefully.

== Government ==
The Jaruud are a theocratic matriarchy, ruled by the Three (aka the Wise) and their chosen Favorites. The Three are also the priestesses of their religion, serving as the living mouthpieces for their Threefold Voice. The Three as of 251 AC are

=== Maiden Lahmi + Warleader Hael ===
Lahmi and Hael handle "military". Lahmi is a 20 year old jazuu woman, standing nearly 8' tall. Renowned as a beauty, she also has a fiery temper. She loves easily, befriends easily, and gets betrayed easily. But also forgives easily. Her current Favorite is Hael, an older (40s) male--he serves as Warleader (aka guard captain/general). He prefers the spear and shield.

=== Mother Jalel + Father Ortok ===
Jalel and Ortok handle the vast majority of the mundane affairs of the tribe. They are the judges, the heads of civil administration, and the "cool heads" of the Three. Jalel is a woman in her 50s; Ortok is slightly younger in his late 40s. They're known to be very hard to fluster.

=== Crone Aela + Shaman Isak ===
Aela was once an administrator for the Frost and is in the last years of her life at nearly 110. Isak is her boy-toy at 24...but he is a competent shaman. The Crone and Shaman are the magical/spiritual core of the tribe. Aela is still quite shrewd, even if her body betrays her. Of the tribe, she is one of only a few who met [[Isskap]] in person; she is also one of the few who knows the truth about the Threefold Voice. Once she passes, Jalel will become the Crone; Lahmi the Mother, and a new Maiden will be called. The Favorites may or may not retain their current position; it's likely Isak and Ortok will, but Hael likely will not.

== Religion ==
The Jaruud worship the Threefold Voice, a "three in one" Ascendant (or Ascendants)? Not much is known about them by scholars; there are no records from anyone but the Jaruud...and the Jaruud are not very forthcoming. The only thing known about them is that their residence is elemental, not astral. They have strongest connections to one of the Water-aspected planes.

What is known is that they present in one of three persons--the Maiden is the fiery aspect, symbolizing youth and vigor and growth, the Mother is the earthen aspect, symbolizing stability, motherhood, and fertility, and the Crone is the water aspect, symbolizing old age, wisdom, knowledge, and magic. They have an "opponent", a being named only as Unmaker, symbolizing destruction and despair. No symbols of this latter one are presented, other than the black circle on their banner.

In fact, many of them started their lives as -touched. But unlike the their -touched kindred, they have been chosen and transformed by the [[True Word|True Words]] at the heart of their chosen plane, as wielded by the [[Named]] of those planes. Their souls, their vital Sparks are bound and molded by [[True Word|True Words]], making them a bridge between the chaotic growth of mortal-kind and the ordered stasis of the [[Named]]. They gain long life, but are not ageless. Generally, one of the -bound might live 10 or 15 times the lifespan of a normal mortal. They gain power according related to the plane to which they are bound. While they still can grow, this growth is tempered and stunted to a degree--their personalities and very essences are inexorably bound to the nature of the plane and the words.

The -bound are bound in a different way--to become -bound, you must be chosen and empowered by one of the Named, and a powerful one at that. This binds you to that Named's nature as well, and to their will to some degree. Like most things, being -bound is a double-edged sword.

The residents of the [[Shadows]] and the [[Astral]] rarely make plane-bound, but it is not unknown. There are some philosophers that believe that advanced druidic practitioners, with their vastly extended lifespans, are the nearest thing to Mortal-bound.

      <text bytes="1832" sha1="awmg5n1eegcrn6qe3376kazxm1q72qc" xml:space="preserve">Of the three types of beings (Named, Mortal, and Abhorrent), the Named are the true natives of the planes other than the Mortal, Shadow, and the Abyss. Unlike mortals, the Named do not have souls (or Sparks). They have, instead, [[True Word|True Words]] at their core. Or fragments thereof. Derived from the Name of their native planes, they partake of its nature. They are ageless and in some respects immortal--a Named that is destroyed will eventually reform...or one with the same name. The only ways to put them down forever include consumption by another Named (incorporating their Name into the devourer's own), consumption by an Abhorrent, artifact-grade interference, or being destroyed while present in full self on the mortal plane (and their name thus returning to its source). This strength is also a weakness--the Named can be bound by their Names and compelled to act in ways that are difficult to replicate with mortals. They are also inherently stagnant--the only way for them to change significantly is for the Word at their core to change, a process that requires consuming another Named...or personality-changing trauma. They require a steady influx of aether to sustain their existence, and their personal power changes with how much aether they can gather.

== Named of the Planes ==

* For the elemental planes, the high-ranking Named are the genies:
** Dao of the planes of Earth
** Ifriti of the planes of Fire
** Djinni of the planes of Air
** Maridi of the planes of water.
* For the Astral, the named are mostly [[Lucians]]. [[Ascendant|Ascendants]] are also Named, despite having once been mortals.
* Some claim that the [[Fey]] are the Named of Shadow, but really there are no Named for Shadow; the Fey are the Named of the Mortal plane.

== Features ==
Members gain the following benefits:

* Safekeeping for valuables (branch specific), backed by the rabid ferocity and full might of [[Zhapai Karmap]], with other [[Registered Companies]] contracted to hunt down anyone who steals.
* Full transferability/availability of funds at any branch. Significant (and closely-guarded) magical synchronization is used to enable this.
* Bank notes, allowing carrying thousands of [[Coinage|gold council marks]] without hundreds of pounds of coin.
* Currency conversion (available as a free service for adventurers).
* Appraisal and brokerage services (free for account holders with significant daily balances, although nominal fees may be charged for particularly dangerous items).
* Notary public and message services at a small fee.
* Loans for vetted individuals. '''Note''': Adventurers, due to their low life expectancies, rarely qualify for such loans.

== Safety ==
Branches are built like bunkers, and outsiders do not get access beyond the outermost room, which is separated from the inside by heavy barriers. Staffed by clans of paranoid goblins who all know each other intimately, as well as magical detection and neutralization systems, there has not been a successful theft by force from a bank branch in its 35 year history. Fraud and other losses are very small.

== Branch List ==
The bank has branches in the following locations. Branches come in either Full or Satellite varieties--Full branches have all facilities, while Satellite branches coordinate with their parent Full branch and generally only offer "core" banking services (deposits, withdrawals, and conversion). Branches listed are full branches unless specified otherwise. Generally, cities with multiple branches will have 1 full branch and several satellite branches.

The "year zero" was reset at the [[Cataclysm]], dividing the years into BC (Before Cataclysm) and AC (After Cataclysm). The result is the Reformed Imperial Calendar. Other regionally-used calendars are mentioned below. This wiki uses Reformed Imperial measures across the board for all dates.

== Years, Seasons, Months, and Weeks. ==
Each year is a single orbit of [[Quartus]] around [[Eua]], which has a period of 384 days, exactly. The year is divided into 12 months of 32 days, each one matching a complete cycle of [[Quella]], the larger red moon. Three months form a season. Each month is divided into 4 8-day weeks, each matching the complete cycle of [[Teki]], the white moon. There are no calendar adjustments like leap years.

The year begins with 1 Spring Dawning and ends with 32 Winter Dying. Thus, the months roughly correspond to March - February in order, although their lengths are different from Earth months. Each month corresponds to the peak influence of an elemental plane.

Weekdays are simply the ordinal day number, followed by Day: First-day, Second-day, Third-day, Fourth-day, Fifth-day, Sixth-day, Seventh-day, and Eighth-Day. Generally, 4th and 8th are "holy days" in many religious traditions.

== Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds ==
Each day is 24.00 hours long. No leap seconds. Each hour has 60 minutes and each minute has 60 seconds, just like Earth. For practical purposes, 1 Quartus second == 1 Earth second.

== Other Calendars ==
Worldwide, most calendars agree on the division into months (although some use fewer seasons, such as the tribal calendars of the equatorial [[Great Rift]], which only recognize Dry and Wet). The traditional [[Byss|Byssian]] calendar simply uses the element names, but otherwise agrees. The largest variations are in

* Month names
* Day names
* Year Zero--non-Noefran calendars rarely use the Cataclysm as the zero point due to the much lighter effects of that event outside the Noefran continent. For example, the [[Ikela|Ikelan]] calendar reckons in years CE (Current Era) or BCE, where 1 BCE is roughly 100 AC, dating from the fall of the dragon-tyrant [[Kozhun]].

A major city in [[Crisial Kingdom]]. The closest major settlement to the [[Crystal Spire]], it's located half a day off of the Coast Road linking [[Crisial City]] with [[Rauviz City]]. Populated mostly by humans and gwerin, it is a farming and lumber town. There is an unusually high density of arcana-related shops and businesses due to the closeness of the Spire.

A major city in the [[Crisial Kingdom]], located south of [[Crisial City]] about 2 days travel. At the foot of the [[Sundown Hills]], it commands the mining, logging, and other general extraction industries. Heavily dwarven, although humans and halflings are not super uncommon.

== Creed ==

# The strong give order and purpose to the lives of the weak. Strength is proven by challenge and combat.
# The weak are protected by the strong to the degree that they obey and are shaped by the order imposed by the strong.
# [[Alastor, World Judge]] is the strongest there is. Thus, he provides the ultimate order for everything.
# Strength must be constantly tested and refined. The slag and dross must meet the test of the refiner's fire and be purged.
# Order is virtue. All that is good is given purpose by the strong; being a cog in the machine or even a slave is honorable if you have not the strength to be more.
# Disorder and waste is sin. That which is not fit for its purpose must be discarded, given to the flame to be consumed as fuel.
# The role of the cult is to perform Alastor's will, to preserve His order in society. Personal ambition only is valuable if it means meeting those needs more effectively. Personality is to be suppressed as much as possible--you are replaceable cogs.

== Hierarchy ==

=== Masked Judges ===
At the top of the hierarchy are the Masked Judges. These entities (generally vulkate in appearance) dress in white hooded cloaks, enchanted to never get dirty. Their faces are covered by masks carved to look like a dragon's face--they never reveal their faces in public. However, the arms of the cloaks are bare, revealing arms covered in markings similar to words. These glow when the Judge is wielding his power.

The Masked speak with [[Alastor, World Judge|Alastor's]] voice, quite literally. They rarely, if ever, show any signs of personality. They are vessels of the wyrm's power, conduits for him to look out and act on the world, ways for him to be in many places at once. They are his Hands. Their word is absolute law, at least on the [[Plane of Lava]] and other places where the cult holds power.

=== Mechanist Priests ===
The regular priests have the title "Mechanist"--they are those that keep the great machine of society humming along smoothly and efficiently. They are all [[Plane-bound|lava-bound]], and self-effacing. The intent is that any mechanist-priest is identical to any other mechanist-priest of the same rank.

=== Lava-fist ===
The lava-fists are the enforcers. The bully-boys, the soldiers, the body-guards. And they are brutal.

      <text bytes="1154" sha1="ttw7saljlmn76s0s8umh4dfsmrqwhjs" xml:space="preserve">A large volcanic island located north of [[Kotimaa]]. It rose out of the depths after the [[Cataclysm]], although there is evidence (from ruins dotting the land) that it either had previously been on the surface or had been inhabited by sea-folk who were very building-happy (unlike most).

Very little is known about the island other than it is dominated by a single giant active volcano and is awash with a surfeit of fire-aspected aether.
[[File:Isle-of-fire.jpg|center|thumb|]]

A research expedition assisted by [[Ad Elementis]] in 252 AC discovered that the island is inhabited by two groups: a scattered tribal human civilization of post-cataclysm refugees, and more recently, dissident [[Khaimal]] dwarves from Hammerhead. The dwarves have enslaved most of the tribal population in service of the [[Cult of Burning Law]]. The capital of this civilization is Lavalin, a town at the foot of the volcano on the north side. Less techno-magical than the Hammerhead khaimal, they still craft and work metal and stone. Extremely austere and focused on efficiency and utility, life here is unpleasant but safe.

It exists at the sufferance of the [[Eldest (Dragon)|Eldest]], an ancient gold dragon who lairs in the super-volcano that looms over the city. By treaty, it is neutral ground for the often warring nations of the continent.

== Population Demographics ==
Roughly 50k, mixed [[jazuu]] and [[dwarves]], although many mixed dragon-touched individuals also reside there.

== Map ==
Legend: The deep red area in the north-east is the domain of the Ten Houses (with locations marked) on the slopes of the volcano, although 3 of the houses have their primary residences elsewhere. The orange sector is merchant-class, catering to the trade between the mainland nations (as hostile relations prevent that trade from happening elsewhere). Light green is the lower-class district, where the working families live, along with the slums for the down-and-out. The dark-green is the docks area. Non-dragon habitation outside the outer bounds of the city is very limited--non-dragons are not allowed more than 1 day from the outermost street except with explicit permission of the draconic ruler...who rarely gives it. Most of the food is imported.
[[File:Toryuu city.webp|left|frame]]

== Politics ==
The city is ruled over by the Ten Houses, jazuu families with long histories. Several of them contribute servants to the undertaking that is the [[Eldest (Dragon)|Eldest's]] lair. The lower class are almost all dwarven, considered workers at best and scum at worst. The city has no wall or other significant defenses--anyone stupid enough to attack it would be crushed by all the nations of Oelfra.

While most of the elemental manifestations fade back into the stuff of the plane, Pyros has developed his own Name, giving him independent existence. It is unclear exactly how this came about, but his consistent personality and identity have been attested since the mid 2nd age.

Some scholars have speculated (without direct evidence) that Pyros is actually an extension of the [[Fountain of Fiery Renewal]], effectively its mouthpiece.

== Personality ==
Pyros is fickle and has a noted tendency to both destruction and mercy, both usually in their extreme forms. He has no ego or normal place of residence, appearing seemingly at random.

After the [[Cataclysm]] when the Empire retreated from most of those lands, the Abantu were fishers and hardy folks living on the furthest island and many scattered nations occupied the area. Since the ascension of Kor I to the "throne" in 153 AC, the Abantu have spread aggressively and conquered almost all of the islands and even as far as the lands directly south of the Northern Badlands. The unity government fell apart about 20 years ago--it's now a collection of pirate chiefs, tribes, and clans. They stand united for one and only one thing--no outside force will shift them or take their waters.

Slavers, pirates, traders. The Abantu raid, pillage, extort, and yes, trade, as far north as [[Nirda]] and as far south and west as [[Bel's Kush]]. They are the dominant maritime force of the eastern continent. Where they interact with the [[Ship Folk]], they tend to clash but not war.

Notable for the Wardline, a chain of enormous ancient statues of unknown make that dragons attempting to enter the territory of the state extremely uncomfortable and "itchy". It is this Wardline that keeps the nation free. It maintains good relationships with the [[Jinse Empire]] and [[Bel's Kush]] via trade facilitated by the [[Kor Abantu]], although the Roltori have become traders in their own right recently.

While technically they do not worship any god or [[ascendant]] power directly, they revere the [[Prophet of Law Unveiled]] as the messenger of Truth itself.

== Precepts ==

# The only salvation for mortals is here, during this life. What comes after is but a shadow and a mockery.
# Salvation comes through hard work, unity, and avoiding greed and worldly attachments.
# Every person must know and fulfil their place in society without question and without hesitation. All roles are necessary, and none is superior to others.
# Profit-seeking is a sin--all must work solely for the good of society and others.
# Ostentatious displays of wealth (and in fact the possession of wealth) is a mark of sinful attitudes and pride. Equality of goods is the path toward holiness.
# The Law of Truth is also the only law that can be allowed to govern society. There is no separation of church and state--the state must wither away and be subsumed as all bow to the Law Unveiled.
# The Prophet proclaims the Truth, but he is not the Truth and is not to be worshipped.
# Mortal sins include
## Public intoxication. In fact, all intoxicants are discouraged, in private or not.
## Public immodesty. Sexual relations are for the purpose of child-bearing and bonding within a society. Prostitution must be carefully controlled and kept out of sight. Flaunting sexuality is a form of ostentatious display and is sin.
## Mercantilism (selling goods for a profit beyond what is necessary to survive). Only the wicked seek to profit at the expense of others.
## Denial of the Law.
## Consorting with Unbelievers without authorization. Only the Consecrated may deal with outsiders, and only where absolutely necessary. Outsiders are not allowed on holy grounds (ie beyond the borders).
## Carrying weapons. Only the Hands and their soldiers may go armed beyond a simple knife or woodcutter's axe. Hunting is allowed, but meat consumption is discouraged except when other food is scarse.
## Idleness. Everyone must work--those that do not work are not to eat.
## Acting outside your station in life. Those that do not accept their Law-ordained place must be thrust out of society and shunned.

Still by far the largest city on the [[Noefra|Noefran]] continent at nearly 200,000 people, it sits at the delta of three great rivers--the Jin, the Luo Ye, and the Huang Sho, surrounded by farmland that mostly goes to feed the maw of the city.

Ruled by 7 great lucian-born (aka [[Plane-touched|tieflings]]) families with ties to 7 of the [[Diabolical Families|lucian Families]], Jinse is a city swarming with devils and devil summoners. Seeing a hell-bred on the streets is common--imps serve their "masters" and sit on shoulders, while succubi staff some of the houses of joy. In reality, the devils are in charge and the families are merely their anchors in the Mortal plane.

Standing nearly half a mile tall, it is visible from quite a ways. No one knows where it came from or what it is, really. It seeks out those who hunger, who experience extremely strong emotions and offers them power in exchange for their hearts. It implants a seed in their breast, granting them access to its power...in exchange for being fed constantly in the emotion. Rarely are these emotions positive--even the ones that started that way are warped into something dark and destructive over time. It is whispered that eventually, should one realize their desire, the seed will sprout and convert the person into a daughter tree...

Scraps of ancient legend say that the tree has been utterly obliterated many times and has always regrown within a few years, reaching its original height as if nothing had happened. Some say that one can hear it laughing: "as long as there is darkness in the mortal heart, I will live and have fertile ground to plant my seeds..."

So named because many of the prime apiaries of the world lie along this road. Paved or cobbled most of the way, it is wide enough for two heavy wagons to pass with plenty of room between. Wide grass strips are maintained on either side for horses and drainage is good. It is maintained by all the communities that border or feed into the road. It is thus passable except when heavily snowed over, usually only a few days out of the year. Lighter storms are cleared by work crews as they come.

Cats have the ability to see Beyond, into the space between this world and [[Shadow]]. They can see the spirits that need assistance passing through the veil, and assist [[Gleaner|gleaners]] in encouraging those who refuse to pass beyond to do so. Those cats that coordinate the efforts of the gleaners and maintain the feline information network are the Catocracy, a shadowy cabal of talking felines. Where their headquarters are is unknown, whether in the Mortal or in [[Shadow]]. It's said that they commune directly with the [[Watcher]], but that too is rumor. What is known is that is that they communicate via eek-mail, which involves a cat killing a mouse and attaching a message to its soul, which it delivers before passing onward. The reaction of unsuspecting mortals gives it its name--they wake up to find a dead mouse lying around and go "eek!".

== Events ==

# Travel. Encountered goblins fleeing north. After parlay, they were informed that a [[Twisted]] cultist had taken control of the mine.
# Scouting the mine. Discovered twisted flesh-sculptures of goblins, still alive.
# Assault on the twisted shaman. Goblin baby bombs. Bor, one of the founding members, was tragically killed in this combat. The shaman, on his defeat, called out to his demon patron and was reborn as an abomination of flesh.
# With the mine cleansed, the party discovered records of dwarven manufacturing, including re-discovering the secrets to making metal-armed crossbows, necessary for hand crossbows.

== Aftermath ==
The mine eventually was re-opened and the town of Bor's Sacrifice founded nearby to provide housing. It is now part of the [[Crisial Kingdom]].

Fishermen had started reporting ghostly towers appearing on an unknown island about an hour's sail north of the town, with an eerie magical barrier preventing access. A scholar and journeyman mage named Robert Spell-wright from the [[Granite-Flame Academy]] in [[Kaelthia]] had come to investigate and needed a bodyguard. The party agreed to help.

== Events ==

# The barrier turned out to be a fairly simple one designed more to ''contain'' than to ''ward out''. Robert bypassed it with some effort.
# Landing on the island, it turned out to be the top of a mountain that had sunk when [[Lake Coy'in]] had expanded at the [[Cataclysm]]. Four towers, one of them ruined and burnt, occupied the bulk of the island. Some investigation revealed them to be named the [[Towers of Sun, Earth, Moon, and Stars]]. See that document for more details.

== Aftermath ==
The towers have become the central home of the [[Sages]] and the [[Guardians of the Forgotten]] Registered Company. They technically pay allegiance to [[Queen Raanee]] of the [[Crisial Kingdom]], but mostly act independently and access requires approval from the Guardians.

== Discoveries ==
This quest led to the discovery of the [[Portal Network]], as well as the [[Dark Lady]] and gave hints about where she'd ended up. It also led to the discovery that humans were descended from [[goblins]] (and not the other way around), which led directly to the next quest when human-supremacists got involved.

Took place a few weeks after the [[Cleansing the Four Towers]] in mid-summer 205AC. Precipitated when news of their discoveries caused human-supremacist groups (primarily the [[Human League]]) to demand their arrest on spurious charges of demon-worship.

== Events ==

# Arrival of [[Alaina]], one of the [[Scale-balancer]] paladins to arrest the party. Quickly nicknamed "Sparkles" for her dynamic hair coloring as an astral [[plane-touched]]. Party invokes their right to appeal to [[Ytra]], requiring them to be returned to [[Kaelthia]] to stand trial before the goddess.
# The trial was dramatic, resulting in the summoning of a possessing avatar of the goddess. Party is cleared of all charges and in fact commended.
# While investigating the groups that led to their arrest (for revenge, if nothing else), they discovered that the [[Human League]] was being bankrolled by a merchant sub-guild that had gained substantial power very fast.
# While investigating ''that'', they discovered a secret underground base full of mercenaries and [[Human League]] goons. At the bottom of that, they discovered that the League (and the merchants) were being manipulated by shadowy forces from the south, in the supposedly destroyed [[Stone Throne]]. The merchant group loses substantial power, and a small shakeup of the administration discovers substantial political and economic corruption of many sorts.
# They acquire [[Hound's Rest]] as a reward and clear out the oozes and other weird things inhabiting it, making the hound spirit very happy. They also discovered another [[Portal Network]] entrance.

== Descriptions ==
An elderly [[Plane-touched|astral plane-touched]] woman, now in her late 60s. Her hair is still golden and sheds sparks, but her plate-wearing, foe-smiting days are over...as much as she dislikes that fact. Still has quite a temper. In her earlier years, she served as the Right Hand of the [[Scale Balancer|Scale Balancers]], responsible for operations and armed response. Known for having zero patience for fools...by which she means just about anyone. Literally Holier than Thou.

== Location ==
Currently the senior member of the [[Scale Balancer]] order, or was until the rise of the [[Prophet of Law Unveiled]], when she and her organization vanished from sight. Last resident in the [[Grand Temple]] at [[Kaelthia]].

Following up on the events of [[Into the Twisted Goblin Mine]] and [[Tree and Child]], the party decided to head south into what is now known as the [[Blood-thirst Wildlands]] to see what is happening with the [[Twisted]]-led corruption. What they discovered changed the face of western [[Noefra]] and ended a great evil.

== Events ==

# They traveled south from [[Yuuras Zaali]] and encountered peaceful [[Goblins|goblin]] tribes who were fleeing north. The goblins of the [[Into the Twisted Goblin Mine|goblin mine]] had been advance groups.
# They spent a day chilling with goblins and learned about ritual sites where the corruption was being spread. They also learned about an old pre-[[Cataclysm]] fort in the hills overlooking the corruption.
# They decided to move on the fort. There they discovered undead and demon cultists working under what they later learned was the [[Dark Lady]], as well as a [[Portal Network]] entrance. After cleansing the fort, they gained goblin support to fortify it against the corruption.
# Knowing that assaulting the ritual sites directly was doomed to failure, they sought out new allies to the west (based on reports). They encountered and made allies with [[Byssia]] (who had been fighting off corruption on their borders) and [[Wyrmhold]], although the latter was too busy dealing with the [[Hungering Frost]] to help much.
# With aid from the goblins (who later became the [[Windwalker Confederacy]] and founded [[Fort Hope]] on the site of the old fort), they assaulted the northernmost ritual point and took it, destroying the cultists there. 
# The Byssian druids gave them an experimental ritual to call down a meteor on the center of the corruption--using the ritual site as a base, they began enacting that ritual against heavy opposition.
# As things became more dire, the [[Divine Three]] intervened in avatar form, claiming that they were bound to "finish what they'd started" and that the ritual would fail unless they helped. The avatars took over the ritual itself while the party fended off demon-twisted monsters and eventually an assault from an avatar of the [[Twisted]] himself.
# The ritual succeeded, but only revealed the corrupt heart. The party set forth, experiencing some really weird stuff (talking tree stumps with mohawks?).
# At the center point, which was the same temple the [[Eyes of Qa'desh|Eye of Qa'desh]] was discovered at (which sparked the [[Cataclysm]]), now ruined by the meteor ritual, they fought a corrupted green dragon (and [[Safrir Tree-friend|Safrir]] nearly died because he thought he could talk to it) and then descended into a [[mkhulu]] nest, eventually destroying the Elder Brain that had ruled the ritual.
# Returning to [[Fort Hope]], they found that the [[Dark Lady]] had been attempting to re-establish control via portal, but had been fended off. In the process, she'd revealed the portal coordinates of her home in [[Kel'al'ar]]. The party decided to do something about that.

Takes place in late autumn 205AC.

== Events ==

# The party decides to investigate the [[Jungle of Fangs]] after the events of [[Corruption in Kaelthia]] and [[Into the Twisted Lands]] revealed that there was a potential threat there.
# They travel south through the jungle on magic carpet. Along the way, they encounter [[Ar Dolema]], a walking fortress making circles in the jungle.
# They free it from assault by demonic forces and discover the fetid bargain that the old [[Fanged Kingdom]] masters made with the [[White Skull]]...and construct a plan to stop it.
# Traveling to [[Ar Salem Dolem]], they engage in subterfuge and discover that the [[Queen Ascendant]] (who was a trapped soul in the bargain, acting as an eternally-living filter for the souls of her people) and her [[Handmaiden|Handmaidens]] desired freedom but were imprisoned by some of her clergy.
# Shenanigans ensued, including [[Paresten sur Tai Nwyedd|Paresten]] dressing up as a pretty lady to infiltrate a cult/orgy.
# After defeating the foes there, they broke the binding stone, freeing the nation from the bargain. They also discovered that the [[Dark Lady|Dark Lady's]] sister, [[Kinlanna]], was seeking redemption for her acts at the [[Towers of Sun, Earth, Moon, and Stars]], and allied with her to provide access to the Lady's estate and a distraction.
# The lady had prepared a doomsday ritual to consume the souls of the entire city, vaulting her to [[Demon Princes|Demon Prince]] status. In doing so, she'd broken her bargain with the [[White Skull]], leading him to assist the party as well.
# After some rest, they gathered an alliance of soldiers from throughout the free nations to assault the [[Dark Lady|Dark Lady's]] villa via portal, with the alliance acting as a distraction while the party descended into the bowels of the estate to destroy the ritutal.
# There, at the showdown, the Lady intervened and after a battle, committed suicide with a [[Fangs of Resolution|Fang of Resolution]], wishing to tear a hole in reality and let the [[Awakener]] in.
# [[Kinlanna]], picking up the artifact, led the party through the hole to the borders of the [[Dark Beyond]], where the party did battle with [[Awakener]] forces until [[Kinlanna]] could seal the breach. This she did with the [[Fangs of Resolution|Fang]], sacrificing herself and the fang to form the seal, but letting the party slip back in.

== Aftermath ==
In the aftermath, the party mostly retired to [[Hound's Rest]] and [[Fort Hope]]. [[Kalesin]] led the [[Kaelthia|Kaelthian]] dragonborn to the aid of [[Wyrmhold]], leading to the final major battle of the [[Hungering Frost]] and the completion of the wall at the end of the [[Last Resort Pass]]. [[Paresten sur Tai Nwyedd|Paresten]] was instrumental in founding the [[Federated Nations]] and still has a role in the government. [[Safrir Tree-friend]] took up leadership of the [[Lady's Grove]] near [[Yuuras Zaali]], and [[Vassarian Kabir|Vassarian]] continued his researches into ways to combat the [[Awakener]], as well as playing a major role in the [[Adventurer’s Guild]].

'''WARNING: CONJECTURE'''

The remainder of this is only known fragmentarily, from diaries of people involved.

The party discovered that there were multiple groups claiming that the ruling clans had no right to do so. There had been attempts to break into the Deep Archives, and odd occurrences there leading to them being sealed. Turns out the groups were being manipulated by the dragon [[Gozh]], who had a grudge against the Alkh clan.

The party, after making allies of the Listener, managed to get access, where they discovered the truth of the situation:

The Alkh clan had betrayed the Bolor clan before the [[Cataclysm]], letting raiders into their clan hold so they could steal the [[Rune Anvil]]. They had contracted with [[Gozh]] for magic to help them in exchange for a fossilized dragon's egg...but had welshed on their part of the deal. And, to top it all off, had lied in official writings about this.

The party decided to use this information to blackmail the entire top council (who knew about it) into resigning in disgrace, leaving their successors unaware of it. They managed to chase Gozh out by confronting that coward. They did not reveal the truth of the matter to anyone.

Soon afterward, the party, along with dissatisfied individuals and the (repentant) council, started a trek north-west toward the old Alkh and Bolor clan holds.

The party, along with a company of dwarves under the command of [[Theobard III]], headed up toward the old dwarven homeland in the [[Giant Spine Mountains]]. Seeking winter shelter and a place to build a new society (because the dwarves were fed up with traditionalism), they found a valley with the old [[Aidas]] clan hold in it, now shadow infested.

They cleaned out the shadows, discovering that it had been the site of a [[Cysgoroesi]] gateway, which had leaked. There the city of [[Shinevog]] was founded.

The appellation "Dimwit" is of unknown origin, but probably caused by doing something stupid due to poor impulse control.

Currently, he is one of the leaders of the [[Serpentstrike]] registered company, alongside Shiv, his former adventuring companion.

Saved by the goddess's intervention (or so he believes), he wandered until deciding to take up adventuring and joining up with the [[Wild Cards]].

Killed by a [[mkhulu]] in 211 AC in what is now [[Zhapai Karmap]], he was resurrected by [[Dilligas Husty]] in 250 AC and has taken leadership of a small fleet of trading vessels in the [[Serpent Sea]].

The party, each for their own purposes, ended up in [[Vaeltaa]] when the [[Horse Clans]] were blockading the town. They discovered a hornet's nest of factors--

* Special agents from [[Wyrmhold]] were attempting to cause chaos so that Wyrmhold would have a justification to take control of the trade routes and town.
* Certain corrupt [[Crisial Kingdom]] agents were taking bribes from everyone and letting everything fall apart.
* The [[Horse Clans]] were seeking after two escapees, one child who was set to be sacrificed to [[Vetel]] and her gnomish guardian.
* A necromancer was making a mess.

The party managed to navigate these waters, rescue the child and guardian, and make (partial) peace with the [[Horse Clans]], which enabled [[Ad Elementis]] to finish the overthrow of [[Vetel]] the next winter.

They then left for [[Fort Hope]] with the two escapees, just ahead of Thel's family.

== Events ==
The party was hired by [[Dashingwell]] to accompany a delegation heading to a new nation to the west of [[Byssia]] on the [[Lost Coast]], which had very recently made contact.

# Along the way, they encountered refugees and raiders from the south, fleeing the [[Tlalocana]]. Some were demon-influenced.
# Entering into [[Auringon]], they found themselves enmeshed in the Tale, which turned the place into a fairy-tale kingdom of knights and nobles...with a dark heart.
# They encountered treachery at the hands of one of the Dukes, but overcame it. They found that he had been poisoning the king to influence the Tale and manipulate the heir.
# They also found the situation becoming more dire as [[Meztlan]] refugees from the [[Drowned Coast]] were pressing in.
# Braving the test of the [[Elder Library]] with the help of the book-obsessed brass dragon Katie, they found that an ancient Tome of stories, now a semi-sentient artifact, had been contracted to preserve the people. This was imposing the Tale on them.
# They became the [[Heroes Foretold]] in this tale, ending it and closing the Tome.

== Aftermath ==

* Thel settled down at the Library with Katie to do research.
* Reginald married into one of the noble houses of [[Auringon]] and is now a duke.
* Morlan replaced the former high priest of [[Roel Kor]] and is heading up the efforts to integrate the [[Meztlan]] refugees and prepare for the upcoming expected invasion by [[Tlalocana]].
* The remainder are floating around and haven't made their names known recently.
* [[Auringon]] is (as of 252 AC) formally a junior member of the [[Federated Nations]].

Technically, "meztlan" only refers to the human folks, but most use it for all the refugees in [[Auringon]] unless they need to specify.

Many of the refugee meztlans settled in [[Auringon]], while the k'jin headed further north along the [[Lost Coast]]. The uacmin were denied passage and stay in the swamps south of the Cascade.

== Subgroups ==

* Humans: meztlan

== Current Title Holder ==
The title is currently in dispute--the last undisputed holder vanished when the [[Prophet of Law Unveiled]] took over in [[Kaelthia]]. There are three priests who are seen as possible title holders (one each in Rauviz, Godsfall, and Crisial City), but the god has not spoken to claim one of them yet.

Clan Aidas survived the Cataclysm and went into isolation, but perished soon afterward due to infighting and [[Shadow]]-caused insanity. The clan elders made a deal with rogue [[cysgor]] for a portal into Shadow to maintain their power despite the effects of the Cataclysm; this portal had side effects that poisoned minds and caused the clan to self destruct.

Known to be iconoclastic and arcane-oriented much more than most dwarves. It is thus appropriate that the city built around their abandoned clan hold, [[Shinevog]], embraces invention and the arcane in all its forms.

Originally an ephemeral spirit called into existence whenever a wildfire reached a certain critical mass, it was synonymous with devastation until the 3rd age. When the Firebird manifested, no mortal force could quell its flames--it would burn everything down to fine ash and the only solution was to flee to barren ground.

In the time between the 2nd and 3rd age, desperate primalists discovered that by creating a focus (known as the Jade Phoenix) and binding the manifested Firebird with willing blood sacrifices, they could temper the flames, creating the other side of its nature--the flames that purify and bring healing. Doing so meant it would take up residence in a mortal host, granting them healing powers and long life. Since then, it is much more known for this beneficent side than for the catastrophic side.

Two organizations are devoted to the Firebird, one to each nature:

* The [[Circle of Purging Flame]] hopes to reawaken the catastrophe and purge the continent of the "cancer" of civilization.
* The [[Circle of Radiant Wings]] has nurtured the benevolent side, picking hosts and opposing the Purging Flame wherever possible.

They gain drastically extended life and magical power in exchange for being dependent on the tree. Specifically, each hag is obsessed with one particular emotion or action, usually a negative one. Envy, strife, gossip, pain (causing or feeling), despair. Each one grants different powers, but the hag must wallow in that emotion constantly. If they don't, the seed shrivels up and dies, killing the hag. And if they sate themselves and find release from whatever caused this obsession...the seed sprouts and they become a daughter tree, cursed to sentient malevolence eternally.

Note that hags do not have to physically travel to the [[Hagfen]]--the tree magically reaches out to those that are in extremis or deep in obsession, offering power in exchange for service.

No regular trade crosses the Eastward Ocean, unlike the [[Primal Sea]]. A few of the [[Kor Abantu]] ships made the long journey during the late 3rd age and have set up colonies in the islands west of [[Oelfra]], but they are isolated from their homeland and have forgotten they were ever colonists except in legends.

== Interactions with Land-dwellers ==
Before the events of [[Axe and Song]], they had little to no interactions with land-dwellers. In large part because there was only very limited sea traffic in their domain, and that only in the coastal shallows of the southern Sea of Dreams.

Since [[Axe and Song]], they have started interacting with the land-dwellers more substantially and maintain an "embassy" of sorts on an island just north of [[Honedaxe]].

Well, this takes the proverbial cake. --The [[Immortal Bard]], recorded in "Drunken Sayings of Drunken Men".&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Allsong is the name scholars give to the endless discourse [[Leviathan]] has with itself across its myriad bodies in the depths of the oceans of [[Quartus]]. It is rumored to be, in essence, the truth of [[Leviathan|Leviathan's]] thoughts and memories, the sum-total of its knowledge, in the form of deeply-layered music. Even the lesser noises of storms, earthquakes, and the languages of mortal sea-dwellers, plus their birth cries and death groans form tiny elements of this all-encompassing symphony. And in that music is power--the power to change lesser life and to shape it to its needs, to kill and to give life.

Some bards have traced the origins of their musical magic to the Allsong. Druids have tried to take shapes more suited to listen--they quickly learn to tune it out because attempting to comprehend even the slightest piece has driven many of them completely mad; they lose themselves and become nothing more than elements of [[Leviathan]]. The [[Twisted]] and his minions have a perpetual goal of corrupting the Allsong, believing that by doing so they would change the things being sung about...possibly retroactively. But this is just mad speculation of a demented mind...

While powerful, Daughter Trees are much more vulnerable than their mother.

Built by the [[Airship Pioneers]] in 212 AC, it has been carefully maintained ever since. Due to its miraculous helm (built by [[Wayland Smith]] and housing a fey spirit obtained from Queen Morrigan of the Winter Court, it acts as a living being rather than a simple vessel. Piloted by [[Sorath vo'Gal]], it wanders the world and even beyond.

== Description ==
Built on the hull of a [[Byssia|Byssian]] deep-water ship, modified with ball turrets for [[Wyrmhold|Wyrmhold-designed]] thunder cannons (firing ball lightning) and given flight by wind-elemental essence worked into the keel-plate, the Flying Free is 65 feet long and has a cargo capacity of around 50 tons, although it rarely carries bulk cargo.

It has no masts, and the above-deck superstructure is replaced by a single oval bridge where the living helm is installed.

== Capabilities ==
The ship has defenses: 4 lightning cannons (2 on each side) in ball turrets, as well as a force arc projector at the prow (capable of sending a lance of hardened air forward a half-mile). It can move in 3 dimensions and hover, traveling as fast as 50 mph for short bursts. At high altitudes, it projects an atmospheric bubble around itself, allowing the crew to breath freely.

Thankfully, the ship only responds to Sorath's direction and refuses to be used for aggressive war. Its only recorded battle was against the dragon [[Xol'cerd]] over the [[Nocthian Caldera]] in 212 AC. It participated in the [[Adventurer’s Guild]] efforts to stop the [[Crystal Spire War]], but that involved no shots fired.

Here, raw, un-aspected aether is given form and purpose, to be conveyed back to the [[Mortal]] plane to continue the cycles of life. The elemental plane is co-incident with the Mortal in all places, but portals connect areas throughout its volume so most portions of the elemental plane are accessible regardless of where [[Quartus]] is in its orbit. The influence of particular elemental aspects wanes and waxes throughout the year based on orbital position, giving rise to the seasons in the Mortal plane. Conversely, the nearness or farness of the various planets (but mostly Quartus) give rise to the "seasons" of the elements--Conjunction occurs in a particular place when Quartus is "near", and Opposition happens when Quartus is on the other side of Eua. Thus, Conjunction in the [[Plane of Flame]] is Opposition in the [[Plane of Ocean]] and vice versa.

== Geography ==
Placeholder

=== Radial Variation ===
The elemental plane experiences substantial variation from the center of Eua outward to the [[Crystal Sphere]], where it ends. While technically it is a smooth gradient (with several different rates of change), most scholars lump it into several major areas, with some mingling in the transition regions.

====Zone of Radiance====
The volume within the orbit of [[Primus]] is composed almost entirely of undifferentiated diffuse luminous aether. Here, the aether emanating from Eua is so intense that elemental variance is muted. The only inhabitants here are the bizarre (by mortal standards) luminous elementals who can rarely be summoned and who cannot survive the much darkened aetheric environment of the outer system. Mortal flesh cannot survive this region without extensive protection--it simply vanishes, dissolved into its base diffuse form.

====Zone of Pure Elements====
From approximately the orbit of [[Primus]] until just beyond the orbit of [[Secundus]] and [[Tertius]] is the zone of pure elements--the four classical elements hold sway as if the [[Planar realignment|Planar Realignment]] had never happened. The only mixing occurs at the borders between the elements and in the wake of the orbiting planets, who drag aether along with them and create a tunnel of elemental chaos in their wake, where any of the elements can be found (although the composition varies throughout the year). The influence of [[Primus]] is limited, only occupying roughly three times its (small) planetary radius (the diameter of the planet plus half a radius on either side). The influence of the twin planets is much larger, occupying roughly 7 times their individual planetary radius (one planetary diameter for each planet, the one-radius separation distance, and one planetary radius on either side) along the primary orbital plane, narrowing slightly (to 5 radii) on the transverse axis. These mixing zones extend into the neighboring zones as well (the Zone of Radiance for Primus and the Life-bearing Zone for Secundus and Tertius).

Here dwell almost entirely pure elementals, although some of the [[Named]] genii watch over the mixing zones. Mortals need some preparations to survive here--to survive the Plane of Air, one must be able to fly, as there is little land, and to survive the Plane of Water one must have a way of breathing water, as there is no air or surface. But survival is possible without exotic preparations, unlike the Zone of Radiance.

====Life-bearing Zone====
The volume from the orbit of the Twin Planets out to slightly beyond the orbit of [[Quartus]] is known as the Life-bearing Zone, for here mortals (more especially the [[Plane-touched]] and [[Plane-bound]] can live fairly normally. The four Pure Elements blend into the 12 "normal" elemental planes. Here, the radiance of Eua is tempered enough that complex, mixed elemental aether can exist normally. Here, in this zone are the civilizations and "hearts" of the planes. Here dwell the [[Elemental lord|Elemental Lords]] and many strange creatures, elemental and mortal. Unlike in the Pure Elemental zone, the influence of Quartus is not nearly as dramatic, although it does create the seasons. Conjunction brings out-of-the-norm weather--rain in the normally arid fire-dominated planes for example, but also creativity and bursts of new life. Opposition is a slower, quieter time.

The influence of Quartus is large, stretching approximately 60 of its planetary radii on either side of the planet's surface and encompasses the two moons. This is also the rough volume of [[Shadow]]. 

====Umbral Zone====
Beyond the Life-bearing Zone, starting at roughly 1.25x the orbital radius of Quartus, is the Umbral Zone, where the differences in elemental aether fade into darkness and stillness, stirred only by small currents and the battles of the [[Angels|Angelic Hosts]]. At the surface of the [[Crystal Sphere]], all goes dark and still. Here, mortal life requires a steady supply of energy as one radiates away all their aether trying to warm the endless dark. Life of any kind, elemental or mortal, is rare and predatory. 

===Azimuthal Variation===
Azimuth is the angle between the orbital plane of the planets and the point in question. As one departs from the orbital plane in either direction along the rotational axis of the planetary system, one finds that the diversity and density of aether fades at first slowly, and then much faster. Most of the aetheric density of the elemental plane is concentrated in a 30-degree-wide cone centered on the orbital plane, falling off faster-than-linearly as one departs from that cone. The same zones apply, but the aether becomes sparser as one goes out--the [[Plane of Stone]]'s endless mountains fade to sandy dunes and eventually to flat wastes of grey ash. 

===Circumferential variation===
The "zero-angle"/"x-axis" is defined as the border between the Earth-dominated planes and those dominated by Water, and increases through Earth into Fire, then into Air and finally ending in Water. This variation is what most consider the "important" variation--it defines the different elemental "planes", as well as the seasons of [[Quartus]]. This section will only discuss the variation one would experience if one walked along the orbit of Quartus in the direction of positive angle. '''N.B.''' It should be remembered that the orbital circumference of Quartus is ''huge''--if one walked 30 miles every day, it would take over 50,000 years (more than twice the current lifetime of the planes themselves) to make a complete circuit. Each "plane" is 487.5 ''million'' miles wide along that line.

Dedicated to dreams--both becoming lost in them and becoming free of them. This is the center-place of the plane, [[Lamies the Silent|Lamies the Silent's]] court, although that enigmatic figure does not hold court in a normal sense. Mortals and non-mortals alike come here to escape the pain of their lives, either by seeking oblivion (temporary or lasting) in drugs or magicked dreams or by seeking psychic surgery to remove unwanted thoughts, dreams, and personality traits and substitute new ones. It's rumored that one can have their personally completely altered...for a price. The prices are only denominated in coin for the least-consequential services; other ones require payment in the coin of favors and acts. They do not share customer information, but certainly keep it.

Staffed by Lamies's enigmatic, androgenous-looking "elven" relatives, all of whom have at least telepathic powers and prefer silent speech to audible vocalizations. Some have whispered that underneath the facade of neutral "elven-kind" lurks a much more disturbing reality--that they are winged, hunched, oddly-proportioned (almost ''stretched),'' extremely pointed-eared creatures with snake-like slitted eyes and needle-like pointed teeth. But not too loud, of course.

It is the ultimate resort for those believing themselves wronged--anyone anywhere, across the planes, can appeal to the Court for redress. Criminal, civil, or personal, it matters not. However, such appeals are not easy or routine--far from it. For here in the realm of [[Alastor, World Judge]], right is proved by strength of arm or magic. The appellant must stake his or her life on their claim, even if a proxy is hired to do the actual fighting. Both sides meet for combat by whatever means they can muster; the side that walks away is declared victor and in the right. The only rules in the arena are that (1) no outside interference, not even that of the gods, is allowed and (2) no [[Awakener]] or [[Jotnar]] influence is allowed (due to the collateral consequences). A side effect of rule #1 is that all combatants are restored to their "peak" condition before the fight begins--exhaustion, ill-nourishment, etc are considered "outside influences".

It's said that the Powers that ward the arena are incorruptible and cannot be cheated. This does not mean that trials here are ''fair'' by standards elsewhere. For example, an artisan, if tricked into challenging the judgements of the [[Cult of Burning Law]], may be forced to fight with unpracticed hands and minimal equipment against an enforcer, which might be a fire giant gladiator or other overwhelming foe. Might is the ''only'' right.

== Overview ==
The city of [[Nara Kara]] is the only substantial settlement in the hostile [[Plane of Lava]]. At about 600k inhabitants, it is a large city by Mortal standards but small compared to many of the other planar cities. About 2/3 of those are [[Plane-bound]] or [[Named]] elementals; the remainder are [[Plane-touched]]. It is the center of the [[Cult of Burning Law]] as well as the seat of power of [[Alastor, World Judge]]. It also contains the [[Grand Court]], where anyone can challenge any judgement...with their lives at stake.

== Sectors ==
Sectors are numbered seemingly haphazardly, but some patterns apply.

=== Core Sectors ===
Sectors 0, 6, and 7 (those inside the inner wall) are the Core. Here dwell the powerful, as well as the Cog Priests of the [[Cult of Burning Law|Cult]]. Here is the [[Grand Court]], the [[Cogwheel Palace]], and the Central Administrative offices. Non-citizens must register here if they plan to spend more than 4 days ''in a lifetime'' inside the city walls.

=== Trade Sectors ===
Sectors 1, 3, and 4 are trade sectors. Here dwell and work the merchants, artisans, and other low-ranking citizens. Sector 4 is the only one where non-citizens are allowed to reside, and only temporarily.

=== Sectors 2 and 5 ===
Of all the out-wall sectors, sectors 2 and 5 are the least-bad. Built around one of the few nearly-potable natural water sources in the plane, sector 2 is devoted to agriculture and the farmers here have significant autonomy as long as they produce food. Sector 5 is the "resort" sector where the powerful have their estates. Some of these estates are nightmares for the slaves, however.

=== Slum Sectors ===
Sectors 8-11, south of the city and mostly buried in lava tubes and caves, are the slums. Growing progressively worse from the run-down but safe Sector 8 through the thug-ruled, remote hellhole of sector 11, this is where those who flee from the light of the Law or who have fallen so far as to be below nothing live. Scratching out a precarious existence as servants and slaves, many here wish they were dead...but still struggle for survival.

Contained much of the [[Awakener]] thought-form that prompted the war in the first place. Originally summoned back into reality by [[Aelvar]] mages of the mid-Second Age in a (mistaken) attempt to draw power from it, it was imprisoned between the timelines by a concerted (and fatal) sacrifice of aelves, celestials, devils, dragons, and giants. There it sat for millennia, although its influence leaked into reality and twisted many timelines. The seal was broken by an [[Archmagistrate of Kel'tan]] in about 246 AC, causing the [[Reweaving]]. Finally terminally defeated and destroyed by an alliance led by [[Tempus Machina]] in late 251 AC.

Of note, the shell of the entity was the [[Broken Concept]] of Hope, now warped into Despair with the Nameless fragment and Awakener poison locked inside. When Tempus Machina smashed [[Namebreaker]] into that core, Hope was purified and returned to the realm. The Awakener influence was also freed of its bonds to that Outside entity, becoming part of the Dream itself.

      <text bytes="1444" sha1="kzqpltc85am7y9dtmjrmlsx1rddgfig" xml:space="preserve">The capital city of the [[Phoenix Empire]] (aka [[Kel'tan]]). Located at the heart of the [[Solar Highlands]], at the (unnatural) fork of two rivers and at the base of the only mountain on those highlands. The city sprawls in the shadow of the mountain, which has been honeycombed and terraced as part of the Immortal Emperor's palace. The top is shaped into a gigantic phoenix sculpture, with the throne room in the creature's head.

== Population ==
Kel'tana is a mix of densely-populated slums and sprawling estates. Overall, the population was nearly 100,000 as of early 251 AC. This breaks down as follows

* Pureblood [[gwerin]] nobles: Trace amounts (~200)
* Pureblood gwerin commoners: 5%
* Magebred gwerin: 10%
* [[Chaudeekar]] and [[sena'ka]] servants/warriors: 30% (mostly the latter)
* Other magebred slaves: 55%

Post the fall of the Immortal Emperor, the overall population has dropped in half, with many slaves and warriors escaping the devastated noble houses. Many of the purebloods have been killed; a few have fled.

== After 251 AC ==
After the death of the Immortal Emperor [[Hafgan ap Kel'tan]] in the fall of 251 AC, the palace has fallen at least partially to ruins due to the unbinding of his spells and partly due to the civil war that erupted. The city is in the possession of the "loyalist" faction of [[gwerin]] pureblooded nobles, seeking to re-establish the empire.

Striking both palms down upon the ground, a web of flame crackles out around the caster and five streaks of fire rapidly snake along the ground toward up to five targets the caster can see within range. The streaks explode into a column of flame upon reaching them. Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d6 fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. Multiple streaks may target the same creature or object--the damage dealt increase by 2d6 for each streak that a creature is struck by. Only one saving throw is made. The fire can travel over obstacles up to 5 feet high and can only target creatures on or within 5 feet of the ground. It ignites flammable objects along its path that are not being worn or carried. 

'''At Higher Levels'''. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you create one additional streak for each spell level above 4th.

'''Location''': [[Temple of the Moon]], south-east [[Jungle of Fangs]] (present day [[Serpent Dominion]]), overlooking the West [[Moon Sea]]

'''Defenders''': [[Awakener]]-corrupted husks of the first druids, aided by awakener-influenced [[ophidian]] tribes.

'''Attackers''': The [[Dimwit Syndicate]] and military units from [[Kel'al'ar]].

This was the culminating event of the liberation of the [[Temple of the Moon]] from [[Awakener]] corruption. The [[Stone Throne]] military units moved into position to the west of the temple, drawing the tribes away. This allowed the adventurers to ascend the shore-side cliffs, landing on the great moon crystal jutting from the temple's dome. There they descended into the temple and defeated the husks of the druid-priests inhabiting the temple, holding them off long enough to deploy an angel-made interference-generator on the crystal. This freed the remaining, lingering spirit of the Green Moon, allowing it to purge the remaining Awakener influence.

== Consequences ==
With the awakener influence in the Stone Throne mostly removed, the threat from the rogue [[Ophidian]] tribes basically ceased. The temple itself became a place of primal power, extending a calming influence over the west moon sea.

[[File:Green-moon-temple.png|frameless]]

== History ==
Throughout the Third Age and into the post-[[Cataclysm]] era, the temple was staffed by a small coterie of quiet-spoken, [[ihmisi]]-appearing monks, and visited rarely. The source of the monk's subsistence and replacement monks was unknown. The monks would offer healing, advice, and other services, but never seemed to leave the grounds of the temple with its three rings of 15' hedges.

After the founders of the [[Stone Throne]] disappeared, the monks became one of the spiritual touchpoints for the local [[Ophidian]] tribes, teaching them primal magics and patterns of worship unique to that region.

=== Truth Unveiled ===
In 212 AC, the [[Dimwit Syndicate]] approached the temple while exploring the region. There they met the monks...and immediately began to distrust them. Later, they discovered that these monks were the nearly-immortal husks of the first group of druids who caused Moons-fall, kept alive by the [[Awakener]] that had manipulated them into causing that event in the first place. The spirit of the Emerald Moon, which still resided indomitably in the shard of crystal, had acted (unwillingly) as a mask for that malign presence.

The awakener-monks had been quietly influencing the local tribes via enchanted drugs to rise up against [[Kel'al'ar]], culminating in the [[Battle of Kel'al'ar]].

Later, the victorious forces swept in and destroyed the [[Awakener]] presence at the temple in the [[Battle of Green Moon Temple]].

== Current State ==
The Green Moon Temple, now cleansed of malign influence, is a historical shrine staffed by [[Ophidian]] shamans under strict supervision, both of the [[Serpent Dominion]] and of the now-revitalized spirit of the Emerald Moon. Seekers and pilgrims to the temple can experience healing, especially of mental afflictions and sorrows.

The highest peak in this range, whose name is not known outside that region, stands about 4,000 ft above sea level, but most of the range is under 1000 ft. It is covered by jungle, and inhabited by a variety of tribes, most frequently [[zandolit]].

Cave systems permeate the mountains, and several major rivers seem to entirely disappear on the southern, higher side, only to reappear from caves on the shores of the sea.

Only the [[Hardshell]] and [[Ship Folk]] have significant large-scale permanent settlement on the north side of the range.

There are 6 major islands (ranging from ~3000 sq mi to 6000 sq mi) and a multitude of small ones, some only a few hundred sq ft in area. The [[Primal Sea]] in this region is shallow and treacherous, with reefs, sand bars, and unexpected currents.

The islands are the home-land of the [[Sena'ka]]-dominated [[Ship Folk]], and contain 3 of their 4 creches (vital to their reproduction, as they do not reproduce without aid). They have enslaved the other residents of these islands, making this the stronghold of those warlike people. Their Home Fleet patrols the waters, presenting a formidable barrier to anyone wishing to circumnavigate the continent or reach it from [[Noefra]]. Their influence extends across the [[Primal Sea]], although as of 251 AC, there are signs of schism between the northern and southern fleets.

== Main Islands ==

=== Vrol'ath ===
The largest island, as well as the most easterly, is Vrol'ath. Its name means "Dragon's Breath" in the local [[Sena'ka]] dialect. A volcanic island about 6,000 sq mi in extent, it has fertile soil and is one of the primary food production areas for the [[Ship Folk]], with many slaves being worked to death every year to farm for supplies. It's said that a great red dragon slumbers in the volcano, but no one has been brave enough to venture there in recorded memory and no evidence of the dragon has emerged except via local legend.

=== Ap'eleth ===
Meaning "Shelter" in the Sena'ka dialect, this was the original landing spot of the Sena'ka who fled the [[Phoenix Empire]] and established their creches. This is "home port" for the [[Ship Folk]]. The entire island is off limits to any non-Sena'ka, and even most of them do not receive permission to land. Only the highest ranking or most notable get permission to add their genetic material to the creche there.

=== Kes'al ===
Northernmost of the large islands, this is the jumping off port for the fleet's northern operations. It bustles with activity and boasts a huge, well-protected deepwater port as well as one of the creches.

=== Pemak ===
Second largest of the islands, this volcanic island is also a major farming spot and boasts one of the creches.

=== The Twins ===
Two large islands separated by a shallow gap, the Twins are the westernmost of the large islands. While farming there is meaningful, these have been dedicated to slave breeding. These islands supply many of the trained, loyal slaves to the Ship Folk's insatiable appetite for disposable flesh.

Ryuukin. Smaller than goblins, with dragonesque scales and snouts, these creatures are gregarious and inquisitive. They tend to be good with mechanisms--they're more disciplined than goblins, but tend to get obsessive about particular things. When they occur as the result of serving dragons, they tend to obsessively protect and serve that dragon, revering it as a god. When separated from draconic influence, they tend to regress into goblins over 10s of generations.

== Known Populations ==

* Two tribes live around the central of the [[Southmount|Three Sisters]] in western [[Noefra]].
* One small artificially-created band lives in [[Srassa Saat]], where they run a brewery and distillery.
* Other groups live in and among the dragons of [[Dragonreach]] and in northern [[Oelfra]]

Somewhat akin to a vampire, but (by the modern era) reduced to a possessing spirit, it was imprisoned during the Second Age, and escaped sometime pre-[[Cataclysm]] when adventurers disturbed the tomb-prison. It migrated east to the [[Place of All Gods]], where it influenced local shifters to create a cult.

Destroyed by [[Ad Elementis]] in early 252 AC when it tried to take possession of them.

Physically, it's shiny black with an oily green sheen and feel. It always feels cold, regardless of the ambient temperature. It requires substantial magic to make it usable for anything, as it shatters easily.

== Mount Imperial ==
So named because of an imperial fortress built into the upper part of this mountain. Not much else is known.

== Dragonmount ==
So named because of the Skydragon, an ancient dragon-turned-great-spirit who bonded with teh soul of the mountain. The dragon is (as of mid-spring 252 AC) deceased, but the mountain is stable. Home to several [[ryuukin]] tribes, as well as now a contingent of [[jazuu]] from [[Oelfra]].

== Stonemount ==
So named because of a permanent major portal to the [[Plane of Stone]] located in its base. The hub of most earth-elemental operations in western [[Noefra]].

Almost entirely shrouded from sight in the [[Mortal Plane|Mortal]] plane, it was visible in [[Shadow]] as an enormous (multiple thousands of feet tall) tree seemingly made out of black threads, with threads extending out into the distance as it manipulated entities across the coastal region and into the [[Nocthian Caldera]].

Created when a coven of five hags brought their Hagseeds to fullness by manipulating the [[Khaimal]] into their current paranoid, xenophobic state as payback for stiffing them on payment for soul-manipulation technology right around the time of the [[Cataclysm]]. They took up residence in the tower of the (now forgotten) mage who triggered the [[Cataclysm War]] by summoning the [[Nameless]] from the [[Abyss]], and used his residual portal to create a safe root zone for their conjoined "eternal" essence. They also surrounded the tower with 30+-foot thick thorns stretching the entire height of the tower, preventing any entrance from the [[Mortal Plane]].

== Defeat in 252 AC ==
The Black Tree was destroyed by [[Ad Elementis]], who were searching for the cause of [[Yonas Akrotiz|Yonas's]] nightmares. As it turned out, the Black Tree was fundamentally responsible for this, and paid the price. After the destruction of the heart of the tree in the Abyss, the tree solidified in the Mortal plane as a tree, now petrified to black stone.

This did have consequences--having been a conduit for many sacrificed souls and having vastly outlived her normal lifespan, her physical frame and soul became unstable. If this continued, she would have suffered a cataclysmic spontaneous existence failure, probably destroying the entire city of [[Ar Salem Dolem]]. So instead, she decided to use the stored residual aether to ascend, becoming an [[Ascendant]] instead. Short version: she succeeded and is now the [[Queen Ascendant]].

The gates require specific opening conditions (often dawn and dusk), and leaving the path results in you being deposited ''somewhere'' in the Mortal Plane unless you have aid. Traveling between two points always takes one or two days, no matter the distance traveled. Those paths that take two days have a safe place to camp. The path is generally safe against intrusion, as long as it is intact.

Some have been disrupted by the [[Cataclysm]] or other events, usually in the Mortal analogue of the path.

An elite monster is a tougher, more resilient, meaner version of a regular monster, but without special traits or features that would define a new stat block.''

== Elite Template -- Basics ==
When creating an elite monster, make the following adjustments. Those noted with '''(CR)''' factor into possible changes in CR.

* Hit Points '''(CR)''': Use the maximum hit points for the normal monster's hit die.
* Ability Scores: Increase one of the monster's non-primary abilities by one, prioritizing Wisdom. Primary abilities are either Strength or Dexterity (for weapon or natural-attack using monsters) or a spell-casting ability for spell-attack/spell-casting monsters. Don't generally increase Dexterity unless the monster has natural armor instead of using a Dexterity-based armor calculation.
* Saving Throws: If the monster does not have proficiency in any saving throws, give them proficiency in any of Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throws.
* Attacks ('''CR)''': Increase the monster's damage output by doing one of the following
** Add one more attack (giving them Multiattack if they didn't have it already). This is generally the easiest thing for most monsters, especially weapon-using ones, but less appropriate for monsters that do one big hit.
** Add some (possibly more) non-physical damage to their existing attacks. The damage type should match the theme of the monster--snakes get more poison, fire elementals get more fire. Or whatever.
** Increase the die size or number of dice. This is really most appropriate for spell-attack monsters.

== Elite Template -- CR Calculation ==
For monsters with starting CR &lt; 19, do the following. Round down at the end. Units here are ''steps'', so 1/4 -&gt; 1/2 is a change of +1.

* Determine how much extra health the monster got.
** If it is less than 15, CR increases by 0.
** If it is between 15 and 30, the CR increases by 0.5. 
** If it is greater than 30, the CR increases by 1 + 0.5 for every 15 extra HP above 30.
* Determine the extra damage per round (assuming everything hits, averaged over 3 rounds):
** If it is less than 6, CR increases by 0.
** If it is between 6 and 12, the CR increases by 0.5.
** If it is greater than 12, the CR increases by 1 + 0.5 for every 6 extra damage above 12.
* Add the contributions from HP and damage and round down.

== Example 1: Elite Wolf ==
The basic wolf has 11 (2d8+2) HP, no saving throw proficiencies, and a primary ability score of DEX. It has a single bite attack, dealing 7 (2d4+2) damage and knocking prone on a failed save. Ability scores are 12/15/12/3/12/6.

Elite Wolf:

'''HP''': 18 (+7)

'''Ability Scores''': 12/15/12/3/14/6 (+4 CON save modifier)

'''Attacks''': Multiattack (2 bites). Extra damage: 7.

Changes to CR: 0 from HP ( 7 &lt; 15). +0.5 from offense = +0.5 total. Rounded down means no change in CR.

He sacrificed himself to imprison the [[aether plague]] until it could starve to death. It didn't; instead, it and he reached a detente of sorts. When [[Ad Elementis]] cleansed the corruption of the plague, the [[Firebird]]'s manifestation brought rebirth to both of them, returning Archibal and the plague (later named [[Bianca Kelshanne]]) to life as infants. They were then adopted by [[Pyrrha Kelshanne]] and [[Eskel]] and raised as their own children in southern [[Auringon]].

== Post-Rebirth ==
A sturdy human infant, much more mentally and emotionally mature than most. He lacks most of the memories of his prior life...or maybe they're just suppressed.

      <text bytes="1631" sha1="c6rfj9gqj6z7dq3ly27vtwegu1ip469" xml:space="preserve">A truly unique soul, Bianca gained sentience as the [[jotnar]] collective that formed the [[aether plague]] unleashed upon [[Tal Elamor]] in the days leading up to the [[Cataclysm War]]. When summoned into the [[Mortal Plane]], the jotnar was a mere devouring force, distributed across countless ebony insectoid bodies. Ravenously seeking aether, it was lured into the Primal Forest, where [[Archibal Kelshanne|Archibal]], the last archdruid, imprisoned it within the roots of a tree structure, sacrificing himself to hold it in place. There the two of them rested for 252 years. During this time, the jotnar later named Bianca gained will of her own and grew to love Archibal and vice versa. [[Ad Elementis]] arrived in late 252 AC and used the [[Firebird]]'s power, amplified by elemental bindings, to purge the [[Abyss|Abyssal]] influence. The mercy of the [[Firebird]], understanding the love she had for Archibal, gave both of them rebirth in human form. The two of them were adopted by [[Pyrrha Kelshanne]] and [[Eskel]], to be raised as their own children.

== Physical Appearance and Personality ==
Bianca is an extremely serious, somewhat odd child. Stark ebony skin and curly black-purple hair, with eyes that seem to have nothing but pupil and only a sliver of white. Currently she is only a few months old physically, but has grown significantly (mentally and emotionally at least) more than expected for a child your age. She does not cry--in fact she only rarely vocalizes at all, and seems to be frustrated by not being able to speak fully.

They have become almost as pale and colorless as the ice of the Hall, and rarely interact with others. They never give names.

Their leader is the Warden (more properly the Doorwarden), who meets guests who approach the hall for services and decides the price that they will pay. He wields the entire power of the Hall, making him one of the unstated powers of the [[Plane of Ice]]. It's said that he once denied [[Isskap]]'s entrance to the Hall when she was the Lord of Ice, denying her memories any place in the Hall.

It occupies most of the mountain of [[Skypiercer Peak]]. At the current time, it's mostly inaccessible--only a small part of the base level is accessible via the great doors in the city of [[Kozhuyn]], but some of the outbuildings form the homes of the ruling giants of the [[Tuura Adam]] in the capital.

It was the site where [[Isskap]] betrayed the Conclave as the [[Orb of All Might]] shattered. It was the site where, before that, [[Perkunos]] and [[Tatsuryuu]] warned the Conclave of the hubris of their plan and the instability of the Orb. It was sealed off for many millennia until Perkunos (newly awoken after the Conclave's reprisal) opened the door.

The south-eastern duchy of the [[Duarchy of Kotimaa]]. Almost entirely rural and feeling the effects of the [[Winter War]] and the withdrawal of the [[Holy Kaelthian Republic]], with which it had had significant cultural ties. Human-dominated in the northern area with extensive halfling populations near the former border. Culturally by far the most traditionalist and religious (almost to the point of zealotry) of the duchies.

Populated by a mix of humans, ihmisi, orcs, dwarves, and others that have leaked through, including a fair number of [[giant-kin]] bands and even a small collection of "intelligent monsters" (including a chimera). Almost entirely self-sufficient, they joined the [[Duarchy of Kotimaa]] mostly as a way to preserve their independence. Unlike the other duchies, they elect their leadership in sprawling, fractious elections. And basically don't listen to them anyway.

== Rulers ==
Only one of note is "Duke" Katria of Cantebrook. She was chosen by lot (she lost) and has basically no actual authority in the Duchy. Each town mayor, family or clan head, etc. does what they want, as long as it doesn't cause problems outside the Duchy. If it does, all the rest stomp on the offender. They're only united against outsiders.

== Towns (in decreasing order of size) ==

* Cantebrook
* Hightowne
* Wolflong
* Rensdow
* Culmoor
* Bauerbay (accessible only via pack trail and water)

      <text bytes="2086" sha1="kpchjdwl20s8v0tkv1yc8nbt3s9m9ta" xml:space="preserve">A nation of [[dwarves]] and hell-bred (demon-tainted) [[orcs]] living deep in the NW portion of the mountains surrounding the [[Nocthian Caldera]]. They have one significant settlement inside the Caldera. Suspicious of outsiders, they are starting to warm up after positive contacts with [[Half Measures]] and the destruction of the [[Black Tree]] in 251 AC.

== Demographics ==
The Sigani number about 25,000, with about 70% orcs and 30% dwarves. Only about 8,000 of those live outside the mountain, dominantly orcs.

== History ==
The Sigani are a blend of the original dwarven inhabitants of the [[Sunken City]], sister to [[Hammerhead]], and the invading orcs of the Army of Chaos. During the [[Cataclysm War]], traitors allowed the Army inside the lower gates, leading to the dwarves retreating deep into the ancient mine tunnels and the orcs occupying the upper levels. The disruption of the [[Cataclysm]] sparked a rebellion among the orcs, who drove out (or killed) their demon-worshipping leaders. Neither side really wanted to go outside, but supplies were scarse. About 150 years ago, the two sides reconciled and united in an attempt to not starve.

== Culture ==
Sigani culture is notable for several factors.

* They are extremely suspicious of outsiders, in large measure due to meddling from the [[Black Tree]]. Only those few explicitly permitted by the Council can go past the outer walls of the Sigani Gatetown, and even fewer can enter into the tunnels themselves.
* They are highly mechanically-inclined, but more clockwork than magitech. They have developed a workable self-propelled cart and employ mechanical assistance with almost everything they do.
* The dwarves do not wear beards, and many of both races wear their hair in mohawks or other "punk" fashions, often dyed bright colors. Piercings and body jewelry are common.
* Internally, they use a form of scrip stamped on iron strips rather than precious metals. They reserve precious metals for trade with outsiders.

      <text bytes="3444" sha1="6jygh5tunqysfi8mms3ccln3tap14sa" xml:space="preserve">A young "kingdom" established in the [[Fiach Wood]] in 247 AC by [[Maerik Mar'osh]], an [[Orcs|orcish]] warlord and one of two survivors of the Mar'osh tribe. Founded to give the tribes (orcish and otherwise) of the [[Fiach Wood]] their own place of security and independence from what Maerik saw as rapacious, greedy "civilized" nations (primarily [[Wyrmhold]], who he blamed for inciting the attack that destroyed his tribe).

== Demographics ==
About 35,000 adults in the core tribes and associated "supplicant" tribes, and about another 15,000 in allied tribes not formally part of the kingdom (mainly to the east of the Abhainn river). Dominantly orcs, but with a leavening of others, primarily [[ihmisi]].

== Location ==
The core kingdom is located in the central-southern [[Fiach Wood]] between the Serche (Freedom) river to the west and the Abhainn (Blood) river to the east. Roughly a triangle 100 miles on a side, it has several large towns/small cities:

* Elishar ~8k (located in the north on the shores of Silverscale lake)
* Dearg Loch An ~6k (located in the south on the shores of Red Lake, where the Serche and the Abhainn meet.
* Northbridge (home of the Witches) ~2k. Home of the Diharac.
* Southbridge ~4k. Home of the Borglas.

And a number of smaller settlements.

== Government ==
Mar'osh is a decentralized kingdom that allows the core tribes significant latitude in self-government as long as they support the king's foreign policy and cooperate well with others.

* King Maerik is also the head of the military, raised as in-kind taxation from the constituent tribes. Each tribe must pay in either food, soldiers, or other goods to support the army, which acts additionally as a police force.
* His sister, [[Diedre Mar'osh]] is the head of the Witches, the magical and spiritual core of the nation. Majority female, these are more arcane-focused than most orcish nations, with the tribal shamans and witch doctors acting as backup. Many people fear the Witches of Mar'osh.
* The core tribes (numbering 6) represent about 15k people. Each one controls their ancestral territory, with the clan chief as governor. Core tribes have pledged themselves directly to the kingdom and provide the bulk of the soldiers. In return, they have territorial control and permanent voice at court.
**Borglas (SW)
**Diharac (NW)
**Ferrmor
**Andia Briste
**Fiduv
**Carraglor
* Supplicant tribes represent another 20k people, scattered among 30+ much smaller tribes. These tribes live in and among the core tribes, intermarrying and (eventually) being absorbed. They also represent those whose tribes were obliterated by infighting, disease, etc. They mostly act as farmers and workers. Some retain more tribal organization than others.
* Allied tribes pay some tribute periodically and in return are promised protection against assault from the outside, but don't have a voice other than through ambassadors.

== Policy ==
Mar'osh has a very firm "no first strikes, but also no leeway for second hits" policy. They do not attack other tribes, but any attack on their territory or allies is met with overwhelming force.

They secretly trade with underground groups out of [[Rauviz]] for needed technological supplies (especially advanced agricultural equipment), but that is kept quiet to avoid complications.

The tribes are under strict orders not to mess with [[Wyrmhold]], their nearest neighbor.

For the [[Plane of Ice]], this artifact is the [[Glacierheart]]. An orb, roughly 30" in diameter, seemingly made of purest ice and etched with [[True Word|True Words]], it radiates deathly cold. Touching it unprepared forces the mortal to endure their own worst memories. [[Isskap]] was known to force mortals she particularly disliked to touch it while she was holding it, forcing them to experience ''her'' memories and letting her trawl through their memories.

Its location is currently (as of 252 AC) unknown, as [[Isskap]] hid it in her last few days of lucidity before [[Broken Order]] drove away conscious thought before her downfall.

      <text bytes="7290" sha1="s9dahzv6nkqp9msgbah1gedbfsq0qfx" xml:space="preserve">True giants are [[jazuu]] individuals who have undergone the Titan Transformation ritual or have been transformed by some other runic power (see Other Methods below). They are sterile, which sets them apart from the [[giant-kin]], but live very long lives (150+ years, with higher giant types reaching 500+ years). Generally, their psychologies get altered by the ritual as well as their bodies, leading to substantial similarity between giants of the same type, but there are exceptions.

== The Titan Transformation ==
When a jazuu attains high enough status (including having fathered/born multiple children), he or she may be eligible for gigantification. This is the process whereby a set of runic commands and powers is imposed on the individual, transforming them into a true giant. This ritual process has several requirements:

It can only happen at a [[Titanwall]]. These huge, semi-circular arcs of stone are covered in runic writing dating back to the Titans and the First Wish. Very few intact specimens remain--there is only a single complete Titanwall on [[Noefra]] (plus maybe 6-8 incomplete or damaged walls, some of them much too hazardous to use).

The ritual requires the willing participation of four individuals of the same station as the candidate (so jazuu for the first transformation, etc). These candidates are forever ineligible for the transformation ritual, although they can stand as ritualists for future candidates. Doing so increases the risk of a faulty transformation, however. This limit puts strong barriers to the number of true giants that can be created.

The ritual requires extreme endurance, both from the candidate and from the ritualists. This is especially true of the first transformation. Failure to complete the first block of "code" results in a malformed creature (an ogre, a troll, an ettin, or something else) or simply results in the death of the candidate. The code is presented below--text after # marks are comments.
 **START PHYSICAL BLOCK**
 GROW IN STRENGTH, SIZE # failure here results in an ogre or ettin. Big, strong, dumb. 
 LIVE FOR LONG DURATION # failure here tends to be fatal
 HUNGER BE SATISFIED # failure here results in a troll. Big, strong, long-lived, always hungry.
 BECOME # success here results in an oni
 **END PHYSICAL BLOCK**

 **START IMPERATIVES BLOCK**
 VALUE WORK
 BECOME # hill giants
 CREATE BEAUTY
 BECOME # Stone giants end here
 DEFEND KIN
 BECOME # Frost giants end here
 **END IMPERATIVES BLOCK**

 **START RULING BLOCK**
 COMMAND UNLIVING ELEMENTS
 BECOME # Fire giants
 COMMAND KIN
 BECOME # Cloud Giants
 COMMAND EVERYTHING
 BECOME # no one has succeeded in this stage since the Titans. Storm giants came close and are seriously powerful, but seriously rare
 **END RULING BLOCK**
True giants gain extended life, increased size and strength, and freedom from the hunger/physical drives that would normally accompany such an increase in mass. While they do eat, they don't need much food (only slightly more than a regular jazuu) and mainly do so for taste and pleasure. The higher giants don't eat much at all; they are sustained by the runes and their imperatives. One side effect is that true giants are all sterile and generally (but not always) lack sexual urges. Those that retain such urges are considered strange by their peers. [[Giant-kin]] (the failed ones) are not sterile and breed true (hence the plague of ogres and the like). Those that fail are exiled or killed.

=== Other Methods ===
Some giants have been observed who could not have undergone this ritual. One known method is for a powerful giant (ie ex-titan) such as [[Isskap]] or [[Korokonolkom]] to invest power directly in them, effectively acting as a Titanwall. This is particularly common in the [[Plane of Ice]], where many more frost giants are found than should normally exist.

== Hierarchy of Giants ==
True giants all fit into a hierarchy based on how far they got in the Titan Transformation. They can be promoted by undergoing the ritual again, but this is rarely done due to the high risk of death, as well as the effect of the ritual making giants satisfied with where they ended up, even if that wasn't what they wanted ex ante.

=== Hill Giants ===
Hill giants are the smallest, weakest, and least-enhanced of the giants. Their only Imperative is to "Value Work". Strong and durable, they perform much of the brute labor in their areas, often working alongside other, higher giants. Notoriously averse to anything like study, they have an (not entirely undeserved) reputation for being dumb. This is especially true for those who left their home clans. As the most connected to their mortal roots, hill giants often enjoy eating (vast quantities) of food and drinking rivers of beer and other alcohol, even though they do not need it. This often leads to a...rotund...silhouette.

=== Stone Giants ===
The antithesis of the hill giant, the stone giant has received one additional Imperative: "Create Beauty". They are the artisans, creatives, scholars, and artists of the true giants--fire giants may be better smiths, but stone giants do most of the design work. Physically they are tall and slender as they pour their heart and soul into their work. Stereotypically, they exhibit traits of hyper-focus on a specific area of work, introversion, and lack of social skills. They prefer to be left alone to do their work, only very rarely accepting leadership positions and only in extreme circumstances.

=== Frost Giants ===
Frost giants have received the additional Imperative "Defend Kin". This transforms them into the combative, scrap-loving warriors of the true giants. They normally train with martial weapons and respond best to strength. Stereotypically, they are quick to anger and sometimes paranoid, and frequently seek power if they feel that their leaders aren't strong enough. While they will generally be loyal to a strong ruler, they will seek to overthrow a weak one. Stereotypically, if a frost giant is in command, their goals will turn towards conquest. This is less out of a desire to rule than out of a need to be "safe"--the presence of people not under their control is seen as a threat somewhere deep in their core.

=== Fire Giants ===
Fire giants have received the additional Ruling Command "Command Unliving Elements". Fire giants are elemental masters and smiths, working all kinds of metals into weapons and tools. They are also mages. They rarely seek for command, but are capable of it. They have the same "Defend Kin" Imperative as the frost giants, but tempered. They too, do better under the command of a higher giant.

=== Cloud Giants ===
Cloud giants, the highest kind of giant normally attainable, have received the Ruling Command "Command Kin". Other giants naturally bend the knee to them--a grasping, ambitious Frost Giant general will naturally defer to and be loyal to a cloud giant, even one with much less experience. This makes them frequently arrogant and "above it all". Very few cloud giants exist, at least in [[Noefra]].

=== Storm Giants ===
Storm giants are failed titans--they achieved ''some'' but not all of the Command "Command Everything". They are vanishingly rare--no storm giants are known to exist in [[Noefra]] as of 252 AC.

A 35 year old [[Orcs|orc]] of a now nearly obliterated tribe native to the [[Fiach Wood]], he had traveled extensively in his teens and twenties, studying history and business in [[Godsfall]]. Physically, he is an imposing figure, standing well over 6' tall and 350 lbs of muscle. He is an accomplished warrior--he wears the skin of a manticore he strangled to death after it broke his (previous) weapon. He uses this appearance as a blind, concealing his keen intellect and interest in the economic and social health of his nation.

== Driving Motivation ==
Maerik is driven by a strong hatred for the inter-tribe warfare that dominated the life of the tribes of the Wood, the incessant raids and vendettas that destroyed his tribe. He also detests the meddling of (mainly [[Wyrmhold|Wyrmholder]]) outsiders that spurred on some of that violence. He is driven to unify as many of his people as possible so that they can stand independent against other nations and keep the peace.

His primary blind-spot is his sister (the only other survivor of his tribe), [[Diedre Mar'osh]]. He knows, intellectually, that she's engaged in some shady stuff. But he seems incapable (or at least highly resistant) to facing the truth of her actions, allowing her to shed the blame onto others.

One of two remaining members of the original Mar'osh tribe, along with her brother, King [[Maerik Mar'osh]]. Diedre is an attractive (if you like them muscular) [[Orcs|orc]] woman in her early thirties. She stands about 6' tall with black hair and compelling violet eyes.

== History ==
Diedre was noted for her magical potential quite young, and sent off to apprentice under the exiled [[Wyrmhold]] mage [[EsJay vo'Gal]] at [[Scaeva Tower]] at age 7. EsJay, in his fashion, both taught her and abused her (sexually and physically). At 15, she ended her apprenticeship and fled to [[Wyrmhold]], where her history becomes murkier. It is believed that she spent at least some of this time among the criminal elements of that kingdom.

== Personality ==
Diedre is a chameleon, at least on the surface. She excels at showing the face that people expect to see, at addressing people's concerns. She is never publicly antagonistic or hostile. She uses sexuality as a (very skillful) tool, but never committing her self to any relationships.

Rebuilt about 30 years ago by [[EsJay vo'Gal]], an exiled [[Wyrmhold]] conjurer and artificer. It served as his base of operations and home for his apprentices/slaves until his death in late spring 252 AC. After his death, the tower has been occupied by a team of [[Selan's Seekers]] and others.

The tower consists of four above-ground levels and two underground levels, plus a covered roof.

== Above Ground ==
The ground floor is devoted to apprentice quarters, kitchen and dining facilities, and a public office.

The second floor has three larger quarters, once occupied by [[Devil|devils]] bound to EsJay's service, as well as a common lounge area.

The third floor was EsJay's private library and study. Only those escorted by the mage himself were allowed to this level and beyond.

The fourth floor was EsJay's living quarters.

The roof held a permanent teleportation circle. It has a gazebo roof, but no sides.

== Below Ground ==
The first basement was a manufactory for devil-empowered constructs.

The second basement was a combination of storage and summoning chambers, where arcane-talented children were imprisoned and forced to give their life-force and wear away at their souls summoning/binding fragments of [[lucian]] entities into containers to serve as the motive force for constructs.

== Early Life ==
EsJay was born to a collateral, but still noble family of the [[Gal]] clan near [[Lyodnoir]] in 192 AC. Trained as a mage, he specialized in conjury and the creation of automatons--he was part of the effort to make the last generation of construct workers used to build the [[Frostbound Wall]].

He gained substantial renown as a mage, developing innovative ways of making smarter, more capable constructs via selective targeting and implanting of various forces as their motive power. He did have a reputation as a bit of a sleazy person, frequenting the more disreputable red light district houses. 

== Disgrace and Exile ==
In mid 30s, EsJay had built a small group of apprentices, journeymen, and fellow researchers. Rumors spread of his seeming sadistic pleasure in "disciplining" his apprentices, but since he preferred taking apprentices from the lower classes and had strong connections to nobility, nothing ever came of it. However, when he raped the daughter of the wrong person (an influential merchant), the whole thing tumbled down. This also coincided with a post-[[Hungering Frost]] drive to clean up society, but he had a lot of political pull...and so he was exiled instead of executed.

== Scaeva Tower ==
He found and rebuilt (with [[devil]] help) the old mage tower at Scaeva, and began farming out his construct creation services. Gaining apprentices from all around (especially [[Mar'osh]], through back channels), he flourished.

== Death ==
In 252 AC, the four members of &lt;campaign 4&gt; arrived at the tower on a scouting mission. He welcomed them in, with the intent to drug and abuse/use-up [[Tyra Blackstone]] for her magical abilities. This was discovered, in part due to one of his hired [[Devil|devils]] welshing on him, and, after an attempted defense (mostly cowardly hiding behind his apprentices), he was pulverized. Literally ground to a paste by [[Asher Frye]].

What is known is that it brought an end to the [[Unification Wars]] that roiled [[Noefra]] after the end of the [[War of Blood]]. It divided the continent at the [[Giant Spine Mountains]] into two territories, each of which then were claimed (in principle, if not in practice) by the two great empires, [[Tibor Imperia]] to the west and [[Quan Pei]] to the east.

It established borders that wouldn't significantly change until the [[War of Souls]] destroyed [[Tibor Imperia]] and put an end to wars between the two great powers, although raiding still occurred, as did piracy.

== Signatories ==

* Signing for the west was the Rai Gaena, later called "the Uniter" and the first true emperor of [[Tibor Imperia]]. She had unified most of the west either through conquest or through alliances.
* Signing for the east was the first God Emperor of [[Quan Pei]], Yao Shun. Already revered as a deific figure, his empire was more secure.
* Present, but not signing was a representative of the dragons of the [[Dragonreach]]--they quickly reached an agreement with [[Quan Pei]] to stay out of anyone's control, in exchange for not meddling in the affairs of the empires.

Notably ''not'' involved were the "beast" races--the orcs, goblins, and giant-kin.

But this time ''religious'' war. The victorious humans, backed on both sides by ihmisi, dwarves, gwerin, and jazuu began struggling for dominance. Two sides quickly emerged--the tight pantheon of the [[Golden Aspects]] (represented by the God Emperors) and the looser, more fractious pantheons of the west, mostly revolving around the [[First Heroes]], now ascended.

For decades, the two pantheons and their mortal representatives worked to eliminate all opposition in their respective domains. All the other gods and worshipers either bent the knee or were obliterated, with only a few exceptions. No one really cared what the "beasts" (ie orcs, goblins, etc) believed--they were pushed out of society everywhere. A few other small groups retained their gods--the [[Nocthians]] and the [[Fanged Kingdom]] among them. And, of course, no one was stupid enough to try to force the dragons to convert.

When the two nascent empires finally turned their attention to the others, a few seasons of cataclysmic battles ensued until the two sides decided that further fighting was fruitless and met to negotiate the [[Unification Treaty]], ending the wars.

Before his ascension, he and [[Nocthis]] were married and adventured together, although they differed tremendously in age. He ascended, she did not. But jealous of his power, she schemed to strip him of his power via arcane means (being a powerful mage) and stole the deific status from him, imprisoning him in a lava demiplane-prison for the next 4-5 thousand years. She ruthlessly suppressed any memory of his worship among his (now her) people and instituted a matriarchy. 

He was released by [[Half Measures]] in 250 AC, and (much depowered, with only a single worshiper in his [[Ascendant]] state) he took up quiet residence in the [[Halfway House]]. He and [[Nocthis]], now merely [[Ascendant]] herself, have reconciled at least partially, although their relationship is still uncertain and delicate. In fall of 251 AC, he accepted the request from [[Half Measures]] to be their chosen candidate to seek the [[Glacierheart]] and become the next lord of the [[Plane of Ice]].

== Personality ==
Quiet and reserved, Elphas comes across as hard to ruffle and merciful. He is not ''soft'', and has no patience for demons or those who willingly do evil.

== Appearance ==
Basically Gandalf the white, but golden blonde instead of white.

It is believed that all nechrarchs were killed when [[Old Wyrmhold]] fell to the [[Hungering Frost]]. Their quarters in the Royal Crypt were sealed by [[Half Measures]] in 250 AC.

      <text bytes="1777" sha1="7avlx98npnvgmtwjk8ajwqzn5y60z4b" xml:space="preserve">Buried several stories under the old [[Nocthians|Nocthian]] military HQ located in [[Nighthold]] in the [[Nocthian Caldera]] is the Apocalypse Archive, a dimensionally-incoherent space watched over by the [[Apocalypse Archivist|Apocalypse Archivists]], sentient machines. In the Archive are housed the artifacts recovered over the entire [[Ages of the World|Third Age]] by the "recovery teams"...or at least those artifacts deemed too dangerous or inscrutable to be repurposed or studied elsewhere. It is not known how large this space is, but it certainly acts much like a (much larger) bag of holding--the actual cave is much smaller than the contents and navigating the space is not simple unless guided by an Archivist. It is believed that many thousands of artifacts, ranging from "seriously annoying" to "world-ending threat" are housed here. Some behave as if they are sentient themselves; others are simply incredibly attractive nuisances.

== Examples ==

* A gold coin that, when flipped in context of a decision, always ensures success (at least locally) for the indicated action. At the cost of massive, crippling, frequently lethal bad luck for everyone else in a 1 mile radius for an unstable period of time.
* A simple cubical box. Inside the box is another identical box. Removing the inner box causes both boxes to open and release more boxes, which then release more boxes, etc. It stops at about 1 square mile of boxes 10' thick (in the center). After 24 hours, all the boxes except the original disappear.
* The original broom of cleaning, which only has a start mode, not a stop mode.
* Many others whose nature is unknown, except for "it was found at the center of a 10 mile radius of utter destruction."

      <text bytes="2127" sha1="rxndrwrmsnz97f0ulg9h0d6vhe7xgpp" xml:space="preserve">One of the very oldest [[fey]] known to exist, The Morrigan (her name/title always includes the article) has been called [[Fey courts|Queen of the Winter Court]], but she would dispute that--there are many Winter Courts and many Queens. Her existence has been continuously attested since the [[Ages of the World|Interregnum]], and her nature has not changed significantly since those earliest records.

== Appearance ==
The Morrigan appears to be a supremely beautiful, alabaster-skinned, ebony-haired woman of indeterminate age...unless you look at her eyes, which have seen millennia. Her "true form" as seen via truesight is...beautiful and horrible beyond words. Looking on her that way is not advised. She normally wears stark, simple, nearly-sheer robes of black and silver [[moonthistle]] silk and what appears to be an elaborate, black-feathered cape that conceals most of her form. A closer inspection shows that the cape is really made of countless ravens born of Shadow itself, spreading their wings over her.

Her presence is such that most mortals find it difficult to look at her or speak except falteringly.

== Personality ==
As an archfey, she is ''nearly'' human in personality, but that ''nearly'' only makes her more alien. She rarely shows emotion except for a faint amusement, but that calm demeanor does not mean she won't sentence someone to death...or worse on a whim. Her obsession is ''memory and valor''--she is the patron of valiant warriors, whether villain or hero. And she holds close the memories of their grudges and wars. It's said that she was a patron of the [[Cysgoroesi]]--if that is correct, the bond has long-since been severed.

She is known to be approachable by mortals, finding their boldness and desperation to be amusing. She deals fairly, although like all fey, her deals frequently have more layers than expected. She ''hates'' to be in someone else's debt.

== Home ==
The Morrigan holds court at the [[Palace of Shimmering Waters]] in the [[Dreamlands]], co-located with the eastern [[Northern Frostlands]] in the [[Mortal Plane]].

Woven from the fibers of a rare plant and infused with fey-aspected aether, it is only ever seen on mortals as a gift. A given garment is created for an individual--to that person, it is smooth and strong, nearly steel-strength. To anyone else, it would be like wearing thistles (hence the "thistle" part of the name). The "moon" part comes because it shimmers like moonlight on water, It cannot be dyed, but its construction forms patterns based on the recipient's soul as well as the creator's nature. Each garment is completely individual.

== Hoard ==
His hoard is fairly standard for a dragon. Gold, silver, shiny treasures of all types.

This causes him a fair amount of discomfort given his personality.

== Personality ==
Segi is a firm believer in Justice and the need for heroes. And ''desperately'' wants to be seen as a Hero of Justice himself. He hates slavery more than anything, in part due to his personal history (see below). His sense of justice is very personal--it's about people hurting other people. Details about who owns what property is much less important, although part of that is cope at his (hoard-driven) need to gather treasures himself, leading him to overlook things like the source of that wealth, as long as he earned it for services rendered. He does not raid or tax people, but he does offer to do jobs (preferably ones that involve him being a hero).

He is very besotted with adventurers, holding them (irrationally) out as exemplars of what he wants to become.

== History ==
Segi has an odd history. His egg was laid before the [[War of Souls]] and stolen from the nest (in part due to [[Gozh]]'s young mistake) and taken to [[Imperial Research Alpha]] right before the beginning of the war. He spent the instantaneous millennium during the [[Concept bomb]]-induced temporal disruption in the egg. He was hatched when [[Corran Scalebender]] took control in ~200 AC.

Tyra’s memories are fragmented in that she has very little memories before she went to [[Crisial City|Crisial]]. From what she remembers, her mother was very ill and she lived in a convent. At some point, she was given to her father. She doesn’t exactly recall what happened when she stayed with her father, other than him leaving her on the streets of Crisial. From what she briefly remembers, she kept begging dad not to go/leave her.

From then on, she was picked up by an older boy named Jasper Blackstone. Jasper and Tyra stuck around together, where the two were part of some kind of gang in Crisial. After some time, due to an incident on a job, Tyra got into trouble and had to leave Jasper. She has no idea what happened to him.

After traveling, she arrived at [[Rauviz City|Rauviz]] and ran out of gold. She tried to rob [[Asher Frye|Asher]], who caught her fairly easily and she learned that they shared the same mark. With that discovery and realizing they are half-siblings, she started sticking with him and helping until they traveled together. 

Her goal is to find dad and also what happened to Jasper. Tyra also uses Jasper’s last name as she has no idea what her own was, due to memory issues. Also she isn’t sure if mom is alive or dead.

== Backstory ==
Born and raised in the slums of [[Rauviz City|Rauviz]], he never knew who his father was except for the stories his mother would tell. From a young age he was different, stronger than most his age and had a bit of a temper. Out of necessity he fell in with the local gang, The Rats, and became some of their best muscle and one of the “leaders.” One day when he was 16, he was caught out in a bad storm and got struck by lightning. He nearly died but heard a rumbling voice that gave him a second chance. This was also the moment his heritage truly woke up, his appearance becoming what it is today and supercharging his body with lightning. Over the next several years, he gained a reputation and the name “Stormbringer.” This caught the attention of the Riverside Shadows who recruited him to their ranks in exchange for keeping his mother safe and cared for. He worked for them for a while until a fateful day when a woman tried to steal from him. He quickly noticed this woman had a similar mark to him and learned she was his sister. After getting to know each other a bit, they decided to travel together to find out what they can about where they're from.

== Personality ==
Asher is both very simple and quite complicated. He seems like just some street thug but is sharper than people would think at first glance. Though he is still very much a street thug and product of his environment. He is a very charismatic person much to the surprise of many.

Bonds: His mother and Tyra are the only things in the world that really matter to him. He's also very good on his word. Always doing the job he's paid to do by whoever his employer happens to be. Has a love of storms as well. 

Ideals: Mostly just wants to keep his mother and Tyra safe. He would also really love to find dear old dad and totally just ask him questions(definitely not punching him in the groin and face. No way). 

Flaws: Has a very reckless and violent streak if his temper is truly tested. He is also quite the haggler and very frugal and greedy, both from growing up poor and in a merchant town.

      <text bytes="1185" sha1="00uud5iricndxyelg54kbq9w96kdwyy" xml:space="preserve">Said to be a magically-hidden vault, built by the [[Aelvar]] but repurposed by [[Tibor Imperia]] to house "weapons that should not be used lightly". Its exact contents are unknown other than a few names, but everything in there is said to be a proverbial double-edged sword, as dangerous to the wielder as to the enemy.

The name is related to some common roots in both [[Yonwach]] and orcish, meaning "forbidden" or "taboo" or "danger".

== Access ==
Access to the Taurishen is difficult. It requires assembling four pieces of a magical map as well as acquiring an amulet of passage. The map reveals the location; the amulet grants access. But even if you know where it is, the map is necessary. Some theorize that it actually exists in a demiplane.

The map splits into pieces, but the pieces can be used to locate each other and the amulet. During the post-[[War of Souls]] era, the pieces were kept in separate kingdoms; their locations were lost (along with most knowledge of the Taurishen itself) during the [[Cataclysm War]].

== Contents ==
Not much is known. Some names:

* Hordebreaker, said to be a longbow capable of slaying armies.

Politically, they are strongly opposed to industrialization and grudgingly work with the local farmers to reduce the impact of necessary agriculture on the surrounding wilds, in exchange for accepting lower growth and a more rural, less "modern" lifestyle with lower-tech implements.

Of the main captains of that band, he is the only one who escaped and still remains at large.

They were freed by the [[Godsfall Champions]]. Over the last 40 years, they've acted in a spiritual capacity for the former Dominion, but have entirely retired from the foreseeing game.

This fractured the terrain even more.

Until the collapse of the mountain, the plateau was under the control of the [[Dead Walkers]]. They were almost entirely wiped out by the mountain’s collapse. No group claims the area now.

The land is barren even by the standards of the dustlands.

= Skill Tricks =

Those who are particularly adept at certain aspects of adventuring often learn ways to use their talents to perform tricks that seem supernatural or magical to outside observers. While they are not magical in the same sense as spells or invocations, per se, they do produce effects not normally possible.

Each skill trick detailed below shares some common characteristics:

* '''An ability score'''. Every skill trick is tied to a particular ability score. That ability score sets its DC.
* '''A prerequisite'''. All skill tricks require a certain character level to learn (including levels in all classes if multiclassed). This is waived for classes that grant special access to skill tricks (see Special Class Features below).
**'''Proficient Tricks''': Those linked to a particular proficiency require at minimum proficiency in the listed area. If multiple are listed as ''skill OR skill'', you only need proficiency in one of those skills, tools or other sources to qualify.
**'''General Tricks''': Those not linked to a particular proficiency are listed as ''(General)''. Qualifying for these tricks require at least a +2 modifier (ability score of 14+) in the listed area. This increases to a +3 modifier for Expert and Master general tricks. No particular proficiency is required.
* '''A target or targets'''. Many skill tricks target either an object or one or more creatures. A few target a particular area.
* '''An effect'''. The text of the skill trick describes the effect, as well as any saving throws required.&lt;span id="skill-trick-pool"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Skill Trick Pool ===

Many skill tricks have wording that requires you to expend a use of your &amp;quot;skill trick pool&amp;quot;. When you take your first skill trick, you gain a pool of uses for all your skill tricks. The maximum number of uses in this pool is equal to your proficiency bonus and expended uses are restored when you finish a long or short rest.&lt;span id="skill-trick-dcs"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Skill Trick DCs ===

The DC for any saving throws required by skill tricks is given by

&lt;div class="centered"&gt;

'''8 + the relevant ability score + your proficiency bonus'''

&lt;/div&gt;
regardless of whether the trick involves a proficiency or not. If you have expertise in the relevant skill or tool, targets have disadvantage on the saving throw.&lt;span id="acquiring-skill-tricks"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Acquiring Skill Tricks ===

Some classes get native access to Skill Tricks as a class feature. If they grant access to more advanced skill tricks beyond the basic ones at particular levels, that access overrides any level-based prerequisites in the skill trick. Everyone else can choose a skill trick that they qualify for whenever they acquire an Ability Score Improvement from their class. At the same time, they can trade out one skill trick they've learned for a different one they qualify for. If you replace a skill trick that grants access to a spell (such as Arcane Initiate) and do not have access to it in another way, you can no longer cast that spell.

====Special Class Features====
* At 10th level when a Fighter can pick a skill trick as part of the ASI, he or she can take an Expert skill trick whose ability is Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution as long as they have proficiency in the appropriate skill (if any), despite not meeting the level/proficiency requirements.
* Rogues gain a bonus Basic skill trick at level 1, a bonus Advanced skill trick at level 6 and a bonus Expert skill trick at level 10 that they would otherwise qualify for. Characters that multiclass into rogue after first level do not gain the bonus Basic skill trick.
* Bards gain a bonus Basic skill trick at level 2 and a bonus Advanced skill trick at level 7 as long as its ability score is Charisma, Intelligence, or Dexterity.&lt;span id="skill-tricks-basic"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
== Basic Skill Tricks ==

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

''Charisma (Martial Weapon) Basic Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
As a bonus action you take when you take the Attack action and attack a target, can expend one use of your skill trick pool.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

''Strength (Martial Weapon) Basic Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
When you hit with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one use of your skill trick pool to attempt to disarm the opponent. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, their wielded weapon falls at their feet. If they are at least two sizes larger than you, they make the save at advantage. If they are one size or more smaller than you, they do so at disadvantage.&lt;span id="divine-initiate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

=== Evasive Footwork ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Dexterity (General) Basic Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;

=== Feint ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Charisma (Deception) Basic Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
You can expend one use of your skill trick pool to fake an attack as a bonus action, trying to misdirect the enemy. The opponent must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, you have advantage on your next attack roll against them. On a successful save, you do not expend the use of the trick, but cannot use it against that same target for one hour.&lt;span id="frighten"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Frighten ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Charisma (Intimidation) Basic Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
As an action, you can expend one use of your skill trick pool to threaten one enemy that can hear you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they are frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, you do not expend the use of the trick, but cannot use it against that same target for one hour.&lt;span id="haggler"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Haggler ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Charisma (Persuasion OR Deception) Basic Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
You are particularly good at haggling. Any time you sell goods, you get 125% of the normal price, and you buy for 90% of the listed price.&lt;span id="jump"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Jump ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Strength (Athletics) Basic Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
You always count as having a running start when jumping. Additionally, you can fall an additional 10 ft. before taking fall damage. Start counting fall damage from 20 ft = 1d6 instead of 10 ft = 1d6.&lt;span id="linguist"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Linguist ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Intelligence (General) Basic Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
When you listen to conversation in a language you don't speak for at least 10 minutes, you can pick up the rudiments. Enough to be understood, but not enough to convey subtle details.

Additionally, you can make out the basic sense of any text written in a script for which you are fluent in at least one language. This does not help you decipher intentionally obfuscated or encoded messages.&lt;span id="lung-capacity"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Lung Capacity ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Constitution (General) Basic Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
You can hold your breath for twice as long. In addition, you can expend one use from your skill trick pool when you are exposed to a source of poison gas (such as ''cloudkill'' or a dretch's Stench ability) that requires a Constitution saving throw to gain advantage on the Constitution saving throw.&lt;span id="medic"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Medic ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Wisdom (Medicine) Basic Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
When you are hidden, you can expend one use of your skill trick pool to force a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that fails the saving throw does not notice you even if you move out of heavy obscurement, as long as you end your turn behind heavy obscurement. If all targets succeed on their saving throw, you do not expend the use of the trick, but cannot use it against that same target for one hour.&lt;span id="piercing-wound"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Piercing Wound ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Dexterity (Martial Weapon) Basic Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

''Intelligence (History) Basic Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
You automatically recognize holy symbols of currently-active religions and know at least the basic tenants of that religion.

=== Sense Baleful Magic ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Wisdom (Arcana) Basic Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;

Additionally, you have advantage on checks made to determine the spell being cast.&lt;span id="shield-bash"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

This can replace an attack when you take the Attack action.

=== Tumble ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Dexterity (Acrobatics) Basic Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;

You can pick this skill trick more than once. Each time you do, pick a different cantrip and spell.&lt;span id="athlete"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Athlete ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Strength (Athletics) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
You can climb at full speed without making checks even on surfaces with few handholds or slick surfaces. You can expend a use of your skill trick pool to climb even magically slick surfaces without needing hands or a check; if you are still on this surface at the start of your next turn, you must expend additional uses or use your hands.

Additionally, you gain a swimming speed equal to your normal speed and no longer need to make checks to swim even in very rough or fast waters.

Additionally, the distance you can jump doubles and the height at which you start taking fall damage increases to 30 ft (taking 1d6 for the first 30 ft you fall and 1d6 for every 10 ft above that).&lt;span id="bait-and-switch"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Bait and Switch ===

''Charisma (Deception) Advanced Skill Trick''

As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your skill trick pool to swap places with one willing creature within 5 feet of you. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.&lt;span id="befriend-wild-animal"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

''Wisdom (Animal Handling) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
As an action, you can expend one use of your skill trick pool to attempt to soothe an angry beast or monstrosity or befriend a wary beast or monstrosity within 30 feet of you. The target must not speak any language to be a valid target. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw, at advantage if it is actively hostile to you. On a failure, the creature becomes friendly. Originally non-hostile creatures may follow you and protect you as long as you feed them and do not harm them, although they are still wild animals and they are not under your control.&lt;span id="bond-breaker"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Bond Breaker ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Strength (General) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

''Constitution (General) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
As a reaction when you are brought to zero hit points, you can expend one use of your skill trick pool to gain a level of exhaustion. If you do, you do not gain the unconscious condition and can act normally. You still make death saving throws as normal, including when you take damage. If you are still at 0 HP at the end of your next turn, you go unconscious at that point.&lt;span id="demoralize"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Demoralize ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Charisma (Intimidation) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
As an action, you can expend one use of your skill trick pool to either threaten a single enemy that can hear and see you or a group. Targets must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you threaten a single enemy, it suffers the consequences of failing a morale check and is broken until the end of their next turn on a failed save and is then frightened of you for one minute. If you threaten a group of creature, any that fail their saving throw are frightened of you for one minute. Frightened creatures can attempt the saving throw again at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.

Broken creatures attempt to exit combat by fleeing, surrendering, or playing dead. They take no actions other than in service of this goal.&lt;span id="divine-journeyman"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Divine Journeyman ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Wisdom (Religion) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
You learn one cantrip of your choice from the Cleric list, as well as one spell of 1st or 2nd level from the same list. You can cast this spell once without spending a spell slot and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your casting ability for these spells. You can pick this skill trick more than once. Each time you do, pick a different cantrip and spell.&lt;span id="fascinate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Fascinate ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Charisma (Performance) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
As an action, you can expend one use of your skill trick pool to begin a distracting performance. Any number of creatures of your choice within 60 ft of you that can hear and see you must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they can't focus on anything but you and are effectively blinded and deafened to all other occurrences. If a target takes any damage or is shaken awake by someone else as an action, the effect ends for that creature. This effect lasts until you stop performing (using your action each round to maintain the distraction).&lt;span id="find-weakness"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Find Weakness ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Intelligence (Investigation) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your skill trick pool to search for flaws in your opponent. Make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against a DC of 10 + half the target's CR. On a success, you learn three of the following of your choice.

* Their highest and lowest saving throw modifiers
* Any resistances or immunities they have.
* Any vulnerabilities they have (whether of a particular damage type or things like Sunlight Sensitivity)
* Their current goals

Alternatively on a success, you can temporarily remove any one damage resistance you know about by informing your allies how to bypass it. This lasts for one minute.
=== Mental Toughness ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Charisma (General) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
When you are afflicted by the charmed, frightened, or incapacitated conditions at the beginning of your turn due to an effect that caused a Wisdom saving throw, you can expend one use of your skill trick pool to to ignore the effects of those conditions until the end of your turn.&lt;span id="people-whisperer"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== People Whisperer ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Wisdom (Insight) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
When you make a Wisdom (Insight) check and the result is above a 15, you gain one pertinent, specific detail about the target's mental or emotional state for every 5 higher you rolled (ie 1 at 15, 2 at 20, etc.).&lt;span id="primal-journeyman"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Primal Journeyman ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Wisdom (Religion) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
You learn one cantrip of your choice from the Druid or Shaman list, as well as one spell of 1st or 2nd level from the same list. Wisdom is your casting ability for these spells. You can pick this skill trick more than once. Each time you do, pick a different cantrip and spell.&lt;span id="pocket-sand"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Pocket Sand ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your skill trick pool to attempt to throw sand or dust into an opponent's eyes. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they are blinded until the end of your next turn. This does not work on targets that don't use eyes to see. On a success, you do not expend the use but cannot use this skill trick on the same target for one hour.&lt;span id="resuscitation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Resuscitation ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Wisdom (Medicine) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
As an action, you can expend two uses of your skill trick pool to attempt to resuscitate someone who died within the last minute. Make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against a DC of 15 + the number of rounds since they died. On a success, the creature is restored to 1 HP and any mortal wounds are closed, but gains a permanent injury. Both you and the target gain one level of exhaustion.&lt;span id="skulker"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Skulker ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Dexterity (Stealth) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
You can attempt to hide even if only lightly obscured. Additionally, missing with an attack does not remove the hidden or invisible status. If you hit with an attack, you can expend a use of your skill trick pool to remain hidden or invisible.&lt;span id="snow-job"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Snow Job ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Charisma (Deception) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
When you make a Charisma (Deception) check to convince someone you know something you don't or are someone you are not, you do so at advantage. In addition, if you succeed by more than 5, the target willingly tells you the missing information.&lt;span id="sunder"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Sunder ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Strength (Carpentry, Mason's, or Blacksmith's Tools) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
When you make an attack against an unattended object and hit, you ignore its Damage Threshold and deal double damage.

Alternatively, you can target attended objects as follows, expending a use of your skill trick pool:

* '''Armor''': Make an attack against the wearer's AC. On a hit, the target takes half damage from the attack but any other attacks against the target have advantage until the target uses an action to realign the damaged piece.
* '''Weapons''': Make an attack against the wielder's AC. On a hit, the target takes half damage from the attack and has disadvantage on all attacks made with that weapon.
* '''Wielded spell foci or other objects in hand''': Make an attack at disadvantage against the holder's AC. On a hit, the focus or object is knocked from their grasp and lands 1d6 × 5 ft away in a random direction.&lt;span id="wrestler"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Wrestler ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Strength (Athletics) Advanced Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
You can grapple and shove creatures two sizes larger than yourself. If you expend a use of your skill trick pool, you can remove the size limit entirely for this attempt.

Additionally, when you start your turn with a creature grappled, you can expend a use of your skill trick pool and attempt a second grapple check. If you succeed, the target is restrained until the grapple ends.&lt;span id="skill-tricks-expert"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
== Expert Skill Tricks ==

Expert skill tricks require level 12 characters.&lt;span id="blindfighter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Blindfighter ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Wisdom (Perception) Expert Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
Invisible or unseen enemies no longer have advantage to hit you. In addition, you do not have disadvantage to hit invisible or unseen enemies and gain blindsight out to 10 ft. If you already have blindsight or gain it later, this stacks.&lt;span id="break-will"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Break Will ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Charisma (Intimidation) Expert Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
This skill trick acts like [[#demoralize|Demoralize]] except that you can force any number of creatures that can see and hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw, becoming broken on a failure and frightened of you on a success. The frightened or broken state lasts for 1 minute. The cost increases to two uses of your skill trick pool.&lt;span id="comprehend-dweomer"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Comprehend Dweomer ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Intelligence (Arcana) Expert Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
You gain the following benefits:

* You can determine the nature of any arcane phenomena you encounter, including spell glyphs, illusions, etc.
* You can detect spellcasting within 60 ft. of you even if there are no components.
* You can expend a use of your skill trick pool as a reaction to attempt to disrupt spellcasting by a creature you can see within 60 ft. of you. Make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against a DC of 10 + the spell level. On a success, the spell fails. If you have the Spellcasting feature, you can substitute your spellcasting ability for Intelligence.&lt;span id="dungeoncrasher"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Dungeoncrasher ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Strength (Athletics) Expert Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
When you move at least 10 feet before attempting to shove a creature, you can shove any size of creature. In addition, the distance you can shove creatures increases by 15 feet if you expend a use of your skill trick pool when making the check. If the creature is stopped short of the full distance by a hard surface, they must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they are stunned until the end of their next turn. If they are stopped by running into a creature of their size or smaller, the other creature is knocked prone unless they succeed on a Strength saving throw.
=== Find Portal ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Wisdom (Survival) Expert Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
You search for signs of an accessible planar portal within 1 mile of you. Make a Wisdom (Survival) check and expend two uses of your skill trick pool, with advantage if you also are proficient in Arcana. The result determines your success:
{| class="wikitable"
|+Find Portal Result Table
!Check Total
!Result
|-
|&lt; 10
|You find a portal to a plane of the GM's choosing. The location on that plane that it leads to is immediately dangerous.
|-
|10-14
|You find a portal to a plane of the GM's choosing. The location on that plane that it leads to is not inherently dangerous.
|-
|15-19
|You find a portal to a plane of your choosing. The location on that plane that it leads to is chosen by the GM, but is not inherently dangerous.
|-
|20+
|You find a portal to a plane of your choosing. You can choose the approximate location that it leads to.
|}

=== Like a Ghost ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Dexterity (Stealth) Expert Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
When you are hidden, you no longer need to be concealed to remain hidden, but you must expend a use of your skill trick pool for every turn you spend hidden without concealment. Missing with an attack no longer breaks stealth, although casting a spell with verbal components or hitting with an attack does reveal your position.
=== Slippery ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Dexterity (Acrobatics) Expert Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
You can no longer be grappled or restrained by non-legendary effects as long as you expend a use of your skill trick pool when the effect is applied.&lt;span id="skill-tricks-master"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
== Master Skill Tricks ==

Master skill tricks require level 16 characters.&lt;span id="balance-on-thin-air"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Balance on Thin Air ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Dexterity (Acrobatics) Master Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
You can expend a use of your skill trick pool at the beginning of each of your turns to walk on air as if it was solid ground until the start of your next turn.
=== Dragon's Fear ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Charisma (Intimidation) Master Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
This skill trick works as [[#break-will|Break Will]], but with the addition that creatures whose challenge rating is less than half your level automatically fail the saving throw and creatures higher than that have disadvantage on the saving throw. The cost increases to three uses of your skill trick pool.&lt;span id="friend-to-all"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Friend to All ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Charisma (Persuasion) Master Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
As an action, you can expend two uses of your skill trick pool to magically call for a truce even during combat. All creatures that can understand your language must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they become non-hostile until someone takes a hostile action. This ability does not work on mindless creatures, including zombies and skeletons.

Alternatively, if you are not actively fighting someone, you can expend a use of your skill trick pool to force them to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, their disposition to you increases by one step for 10 minutes or until you take hostile action against them. Once the effect ends, they will still follow through on any bargains struck during that time (if their nature allows--exceptionally chaotic entities such as demons will act according to their natures), but their disposition toward you may change.&lt;span id="force-portal"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Force Portal ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Wisdom (Arcana) Master Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
As an action, you can expend two uses of your skill trick pool to force a micro-fissure in the fabric of the planes to form a full-fledged portal that lasts for 6 seconds. You can choose what plane it exits to, but only a rough description of the location on that plane.&lt;span id="healing-hands"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
=== Healing Hands ===

&lt;div&gt;

''Wisdom (Medicine) Master Skill Trick''

&lt;/div&gt;
As an action you can expend three uses of your skill trick pool to magically do one of the following to a creature you touch.

* Heal the creature to half of its maximum hit points.
* Remove any condition from a living creature.
* Cure any disease and remove any poison or curse affecting the creature.
* Break one spell affecting the creature.
* Restore a dead body to life as long as it has been dead less than 1 hour. Taking this benefit causes both you and the target 3 levels of exhaustion.

Appears as a feather-winged "dragon-like" figure--a long snaky body, four small legs, and four long white wings. His true nature is unknown to scholars. He is known to enjoy music of all types.

As befits his chosen plane, he wanders throughout the realm and does very little "lord" business, intervening only when substantial conflicts threaten to break out or when outside forces cause significant problems. When he does, the results are exceedingly unpleasant for all guilty parties. And "guilty" attaches without much discrimination.

      <text bytes="3208" sha1="gxovbqez1vaql0l40prmboibewuexzx" xml:space="preserve">The Shadows are a criminal gang that controls much of the residential slums of [[Rauviz City]].

== Organization ==
'''Symbol''': A black scarf, tied around the neck or around an upper arm.

The gang is organized into turfs (geographically-distinct chunks of the city, usually bounded by a larger road). Each turf's enforcers pay homage to a turf-boss, who usually gets that status by being the meanest/toughest goon. The boss generally has a small number (2-3) of lieutenants. Turf wars between bosses are not unknown--the way you rise in the organization is by taking from another boss. More underlings equals more status.

At the top of the gang are the two operational leaders (the Daymaster and Nightmaster, each responsible for half the day) and above them is the Shadowmaster. Books (the quartermaster/treasurer) rounds out the top 4.

=== Daymaster and Nightmaster ===
The current Daymaster is Arnold Blackhand, a 6'5", 350-lb human (although some would question that) man in his late 20s. Extremely ugly, mostly due to repeated bare-knuckle fights. Known for superior toughness and physical strength and for not taking no guff from nobody.

The current Nightmaster is Jennifer Anna Stone, a 5'2, 100-lb half-elf (sharp-ear) woman in her mid 30s. She would be beautiful...except for the livid scar that runs across the left side of her face. And her nearly-constant giggle, which is said to drive shivers of fear up the spine of the most fearless goon. She loves her knives. Much more intellectual than Arnold, but mostly in the service of causing pain.

=== Books ===
The treasurer of the Shadows is always called Books, whatever their old name was. The current Books is a pleasant, unassuming dwarven woman in her mid 60s. Not much is known about her past, other than that she abandoned her family and husband some time ago. Only money moves her--she is death on debtors who don't pay up.

=== Shadowmaster ===
The current Shadowmaster is somewhat of an enigma. A foppish human, native to Rauviz City, Jerold Day-lily never showed much competence in his privileged life. Then suddenly at age 25 he threw away his station in life (or did he?) and started rising through the ranks of the Shadows. He lived a charmed life, avoiding assassination attempts as if warned in advance...but with no display of cunning. He'd just...not be there. Or the knives would miss. Or the killers would turn on each other. And then their paymasters would be found dead in accidents. He ascended to the rank of Shadowmaster about 10 years ago (an eternity in a gang like this) and has generally stayed out of the day-to-day. But his favorites do well and those who oppose him...vanish.

== Operations ==
The Shadows are primarily a protection racket. They "police" the slums, providing toughs to squash any demonstrations and demand that business pay them "so things don't burn down accidentally." They do light money-lending and facilitate a lot of smuggling, but don't necessarily handle the details themselves. They are known to have heavy ties with landholders and industrial magnates in their territory, and many of the thugs have daylight jobs with Spode or similar.

Not all practitioners of wizardry are academics. Trained in military schools to accompany soldiers into battle against foes both humanoid and monstrous, the warmages are, as their name suggests, specialists in the combat applications of magic. While their magic, like that of wizards, is learned rather than instinctive or channeled, the warmages focus on rote memorization of useful magical formulae and the practical applications of such spells. This limits their ultimate power as they do not have the theoretical understanding of the deeper magics. On the other hand, this practical approach allows them to be more efficient with their spell-casting than most wizards.

== Multiclassing ==
The Warmage is not designed to be compatible with multiclassing.

== Class Features ==
As a warmage, you gain the following class features

=== Hit Points ===
Hit Dice: 1d8 per warmage level

Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier

Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per warmage level after 1st

=== Proficiencies ===
Armor: Light Armor

Weapons: Simple weapons, Rapiers, Longbows.

Tools: Leatherworkers, Blacksmiths, Masons, or Woodcarvers' tools

Saving Throws: Dexerity, Intelligence

Skills: Choose two from Athletics, Arcana, Animal Handling, Medicine, or Survival

=== Equipment ===
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

* (a) a simple weapon or (b) a martial weapon if proficient

* (a) a suit of leather armor or (b) scale mail if proficient

* (a) a longbow and 20 arrows or (b) 5 javelins

* an explorer's pack

=== Spellcasting ===
Your ability with spells is why you were trained. Your spells come by memorization and long practice.

See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the warmage spell list.

==== Cantrips ====
At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the warmage spell list. You learn additional warmage cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warmage table.

==== Spell Slots ====
The Warmage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warmage spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these warmage spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast burning hands using either slot.

==== Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher ====
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warmage spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warmage table shows when you learn more warmage spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Warmage spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Warmage spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

==== Spellcasting Ability ====
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warmage spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to remember and flawlessly execute complex incantations in stressful situations. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warmage spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

==== Spellcasting Focus ====
You can use a melee weapon with which you are proficient as a spellcasting focus for your warmage spells but you must be holding it to do so.

=== Squad Assignment ===
All warmages are trained for specific assignments based on the type of squad they normally accompany into hostile situations. Choose between the Line Infantry, Special Forces, Artillery, or Heavy Assault assignments.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.

=== Power Siphon ===
Starting at 2nd level, you have learned to siphon off some of the energies that would otherwise be wasted when you cast your warmage spells. When you cast a warmage spell of 1st level or higher, you gain a number of siphon motes equal to half the spell's level, rounded up. You can have a number of motes equal to your level in this class at any one time--any extras generated are lost. Your accumulated siphon motes are reset to zero when you finish a long rest.

Siphon motes can be expended in many ways--each Squad Assignment provides its own uses. The most fundamental use is to empower spells. When you cast a warmage spell of 1st level or higher, you can cast it as if from a higher level slot by expending a number of siphon motes equal to twice the difference between the intended spell slot and the slot you expended. The spell acts as if it was cast out of that higher slot, but you do not regain motes from the cast or expend that higher-level slot. You cannot use this feature to upcast a spell more than one spell level above the highest level of slots you have.

=== Piercing Spell ===
Starting at 3rd level, you have learned to augment your spells to overcome resistance and immunity. When you cast a warmage spell of 1st level or higher that deals damage, you can expend one siphon mote to ignore defenses such as Magic Resistance. If the target has immunity to the damage type, you can choose to instead deal damage of a type they are not immune to. When you do so, the target takes the 1/4 of the normal damage of the spell.

=== Ability Score Increase ===
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

=== Extra Attack ===
Starting at 5th level, you can attack twice instead of once when you take the Attack action on your turn. You can choose to cast a warmage cantrip instead of one (and only one) of the weapon attacks.

=== Spell Efficiency ===
Starting at 7th level, you siphon one mote when you cast a warmage cantrip.

=== Magic Sensitivity ===
Starting at 9th level, you have become sensitive to the flows of magic around you. You learn identify. Additionally, you learn detect magic (if you didn't already know it). These spells no longer count against your limit of spells known and you can cast them at will without spending spell slots to do so.

=== Dualcasting ===
At 11th level you can expend a siphon mote when you cast a spell. When you do so, the cast time changes to a Bonus Action.

=== Focused Spell ===
At 15th level, you've chosen one spell to specialize in. Choose one of your warmage spells. When you cast that spell, it always acts as if it is one level higher in all respects except the spell slot needed to cast it. You can siphon motes from it as if it was the higher level; when you expend motes to further enhance it, it acts as if it was the higher level for calculating the cost.

=== Siphon Mastery ===
At 20th level, you are even better at using siphoned energy. When you would gain motes normally, you gain twice as many as long as you have less than half your maximum.

== Squad Assignments ==

=== Line Infantry ===
Line Infantry squads are in the thickest of the battle and often ordered to hold objectives against overwhelming force. Warmages assigned to Line squads have one primary mission--keep their squad alive against whatever the enemy throws at them.

==== Bonus Spells ====
You gain the following spells known at the indicated levels. These do not count against your spells known limit but cannot be traded out.
{| class="wikitable"
|Level
|Spell
|-
|1st
|Healing Word

|Magic Weapon
|-
|5th
|Aura of Vitality
|-
|7th
|Stoneskin
|-
|9th
|Mass Cure Wounds
|}

==== Armored Caster ====
When you pick this assignment at first level, you gain proficiency in medium armor and shields and can cast warmage spells while wearing and wielding them. You can use your shield as a focus for your spells.

==== Martial Specialist ====
You gain proficiency in martial weapons.

==== Warding Motes ====
Starting at 6th level, you can expend your siphon motes to shield your allies. As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one or more motes to create a protective barrier around you until the end of your next turn. This barrier has a radius of 10 ft and hit points equal to the number of motes expended times your proficiency bonus. The barrier has two effects. First, when an effect targets a point in space inside the barrier, it targets the surface of the barrier instead. Second, when a creature within the barrier would take damage from a source outside the barrier, the barrier absorbs that damage as long as it has hit points remaining. If multiple creatures would take damage from the same effect, you can split the absorption effect among those creatures as you choose.

In addition, when you cast any of your Line Infantry spells while the barrier is active, you can designate an additional ally within the warded zone to receive the benefits of that spell without further cost (including expending additional costly components). If the spell requires concentration and your concentration is broken, both instances of the spell are lost.

==== Enhanced Concentration ====
Starting at 10th level, you gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws.

==== Enhanced Spell Disruption ====
Starting at 14th level, when you cast counterspell or dispel magic and must make a check to see if it succeeds, you do so at advantage.

==== Enhanced Piercing Spell ====
Starting at 18th level, when you use your Piercing Spell feature, the target loses any resistance to the damage type dealt until the beginning of your next turn; if it was immune, it loses that immunity and gains resistance to that damage type until the beginning of your next turn.

=== Special Forces ===
The special forces squads are infiltrators, taking on missions deep into enemy territory. Stealth and overwhelming power from surprise are the name of the game. Warmages attached to these squads train to enhance both aspects.

==== Bonus Spells ====
You gain the following spells known at the indicated levels. These do not count against your spells known limit but cannot be traded out.
{| class="wikitable"
|Level
|Spell
|-
|1st
|Bane
|-
|3rd
|Pass without Trace
|-
|5th
|Tiny Hut
|-
|7th
|Dimension Door
|-
|9th
|Telepathic Bond
|}

==== Bonus Proficiencies ====
You gain proficiency in Stealth. If you already had it, you can instead apply twice your proficiency bonus when you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. You also gain proficiency in Athletics.

You also learn one additional language of your choice.

==== Magical Assassin ====
You learn to apply your magical talents to hone your weapon strikes. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

The extra damage dealt increases by 1d6 when you reach each of 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels. Starting at 9th level, you can also deal this extra damage when you hit with a warmage cantrip requiring an attack roll.

==== Keen Motes ====
Starting at 6th level, you can expend one or more of your siphon motes as a bonus action. When you do so, choose a number of allies within 30 feet of you equal to the motes you expended. Chosen allies deal an extra 1d4 force damage when they hit with a weapon attack for the next minute.

==== Enhancing Motes ====
Starting at 6th level, you have also learned to bolster your allies in other ways. Target an ally within 30' of you and expend a mote as a bonus action. That ally can add 1d4 to all ability checks and saving throws it makes for the next minute. Only one ally can be enhanced in this fashion at a time.

==== Bolstered Enhancement ====
Starting at 10th level, your Keen and Enhancing Motes are more effective. When you use your Keen Motes ability, the extra damage dealt is equal to 2d4 instead of 1d4. When you use your Enhancing Motes ability, you can expend extra motes to target a number of allies within 30 feet of you equal to the number of motes expended (instead of one).

==== Enhanced Infiltration ====
Starting at 14th level, when an ally within 30' of you makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check or a Charisma (Deception) check, you can use your reaction to grant advantage on the check.

==== Spellstrike ====
Starting at 18th level, when you cast a spell as a bonus action using your Doublecast ability and use your action to Disengage, Hide, or Guard, you can make a weapon attack before or after the action.

=== Artillery Squad ===
Like the squads they're attached to, Artillery Squad warmages specialize in raining death and destruction down on their foes from a distance. "There's no kill like overkill" is the motto of many such a mage.

==== Bonus Spells ====
You gain the following spells known at the indicated levels. These do not count against your spells known limit but cannot be traded out.
{| class="wikitable"
|Level
|Spell
|-
|1st
|Chromatic Orb
|-
|3rd
|Shatter
|-
|5th
|Fireball
|-
|7th
|Sleet Storm
|-
|9th
|Wall of Force
|}

==== Sculpt Spell ====
Beginning at 1st level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your warmage spells. When you cast a warmage spell that affects creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

==== Widening Motes ====
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a warmage spell that targets a point in space or has a range of Self (X feet), you can expend one or more siphon motes (in addition to any used to heighten the spell). When you do so, the number that defines the size of the affected area increases by 5' for every mote expended. Thus, a 20' sphere becomes a 25' sphere if you spend one mote, 30' if you spend two. An aura of Self(10 ft) becomes Self(20 ft) on spending two motes. Etc.

==== Empowered Evocation ====
Starting at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any warmage spell you cast.

==== Relocate ====
Starting at 14th level, when you take the Disengage action, you can move half your speed as part of the action.

==== Explosive Dualcasting ====
Starting at 18th level, you can rain death down on enemies even faster. When you use your Dualcasting feature, you can cast any warmage spell of 5th level or lower (including mote-based upcasting) that deals damage and has a cast time of one action with your action on that same turn instead of just a cantrip.

=== Heavy Assault Squad ===
Heavy Assault squads are those who specialize in fighting monstrous and magical beasts; they specialize in taking down the largest, most heavy hitting enemies around. The mages who serve in these squads are self-sufficient and bolster their own strength by sapping the life of their foes.

==== Bonus Spells ====
You gain the following spells known at the indicated levels. These do not count against your spells known limit but cannot be traded out.
{| class="wikitable"
|Level
|Spell
|-
|1st
|False Life
|-
|3rd
|Wither and Bloom*
|-
|5th
|Life Transference*
|-
|7th
|Vampiric Touch
|-
|9th
|Enervation
|}
Spells marked with * are found in sources other than the Players Handbook and can be substituted for similarly-themed spells at the GM's discretion if not available.

==== Armored Caster ====
When you pick this assignment at level one, you gain proficiency in medium armor and shields and can cast warmage spells while wearing and wielding them. You can use your shield as a focus for your spells.

==== Bonus Cantrip ====
You learn chill touch as a warmage cantrip. It does not count against your limit of cantrips known.

==== Drain Life ====
Starting when you pick this assignment at level one, you drain life from your dying foes. When an enemy is reduced to zero hit points within 30' of you that you damaged with a weapon attack or warmage spell since the beginning of your previous turn, you gain temporary hit points equal to your level.

==== Healing Motes ====
Starting at 6th level, you have learned to heal others with life stolen from your foes. When you damage an enemy with a spell you cast, you can expend a siphon mote to heal an ally you can see within 30' of you for 1d4 per mote expended.

==== Necrotic Recoil ====
Starting at 10th level, as long as you have temporary hit points from your Drain Life feature, attacks that hit you deal necrotic damage equal to your level to the attacker.

==== Inured to Rot ====
Starting at 14th level, you gain resistance to necrotic damage.

==== Spellshroud ====
Starting at 18th level, when you cast a spell as a bonus action using your Dualcasting feature, you can designate an enemy you can see within 30' of you. Any attacks that enemy makes against you until the beginning of your next turn are made at disadvantage.

== Warmage Spell List ==
Note: the warmage is intentionally limited to spells of 5th level and lower and have a fairly restricted "utility belt" of spell choices. They are intended to use upper slots for upcasting lower-level spells and mostly cast damaging/direct combat spells. This is why they have Extra Attack and other features (relative to a wizard).
