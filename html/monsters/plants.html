		<h1 class="section">Plants</h1>
		<p>Most plants are not a threat and thus do not have stat blocks; things like toxic molds, poison thistles, etc are hazards, not creatures. But in a fantasy world, there are certainly animate plants. They are detailed here.</p>
		
		<h2>Awakened Plants</h2>
		<p>These plants were brought to life by spells and magic. Some have been given a form of sentience, but some are bound to their creator and act as animate tools of nature's wrath.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Awakened plants are highly uncommon. Only shamans, rangers, and those hailing from or studied in the great forests of Byssia, Kotimaa, or the Fiach Woods will be familiar with them, and only after an Intelligence (Nature) check.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Awakened plants are rare outside of druidic groves, and not common even then. They are most common in the great kami-ruled forest wildernesses far from permanent settlements. When they do appear, they tend to appear in mixed groups of 2-10.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Awakened plants rarely have much in the way of tactics. Their only trick is to stay motionless and surprise their targets.</p>

		<h2>Fungi</h2>
		<p>The monstrous fungi such as the violet fungus are barely alive in the normal sense of that word. They react, rather than think. Usually brought to life by corrupting influences, especially that of the Hagfen. They stay quiet until a living thing is in their reach, and then reach out tendrils that rot the flesh.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Hostile fungi are rare outside corrupted areas and the Hagfen. Knowing about them requires an Intelligence (Nature) check.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Hostile fungi are common inside the Hagfen and in underground areas with heavy corrupted influences such as Moon's Vengeance. When they appear, they appear in large clusters (2d6+1).</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> None, really. They use their False Appearance until they are detected or until a target is in range, and then attack.</p>

		<h2>Shambling Mound</h2>
		<p>The shambling mound is, as its name suggests, a mobile hillock of overgrown plant-life. Why is it animate? Well, theories differ. Some say that mounds are animated by fey protectors to defend the wilds against despoilers. Others claim that a sudden influx of lightning aether can spontaneously bring life, pointing to their ability to absorb lightning and heal from it. Others, as usual, blame the elves. Except instead of the aelvar wizards, the most usual suspect is the ancient ihmisi druids...Whatever the source of their existence, they are a bane of wood-cutters and forest dwellers throughout Quartus.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Shambling mounds are attested throughout all wooded areas of Quartus. Those with backgrounds in the woods know about them without a check; others require an Investigation (Nature) check.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> All wooded areas, especially those of the northern forests of Kotimaa and the Fiach Woods. When they appear, they are usually alone or in pairs, never more. They do often appear in conjunction with fey, treants, or other forest inhabitants.</p>
		<p>As with most plants, a mound's tactics tend to be straightforward. Grab the nearest thing it can, and engulf it. Then move on to the next one.</p>
		<div class="monster">

				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Lightning Absorption.</b></p>
				<p>Whenever the shambling mound is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Actions</h3>
			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Multiattack.</b></p>
				<p>The shambling mound makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is grappled (escape DC 14), and the shambling mound uses its Engulf on it.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="monster-attack"><b>Slam.</b> <em>Melee Weapon Attack.</em> <em>+5 to hit, range 5 ft.</em> <em>Hit:</em> 2d8 + 4 bludgeoning.</p>
			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Engulf.</b></p>
				<p>The shambling mound engulfs a Medium or smaller creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is blinded, restrained, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the mound's turns or take 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the mound moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The mound can have only one creature engulfed at a time.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h2>Treant</h2>
		<p>The treant is the acknowledged guardian of the forests. Ancient trees are often the home of great kami and frequently act as stewards and shepherds for the rest of the forest. Though slow to anger, they are fierce once roused and can bring other trees to life. They especially dislike axes and fire.</p>
		<p>The spellwarper variant are generally malicious and vengeful. They particularly enjoy causing arcane casters distress.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Rare. Those deeply knowledgeable about the kami and the great forests may know about them automatically (this does not include detecting them before they move!), for others a hard Intelligence (Nature) check is needed to gain reliable information. The spellwarper variant are virtually unknown, even in legend. No one who hasn't encountered them before knows they are different from regular treants.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> Druidic groves, sacred forest areas, and other such places. When they appear, they are often in 2s and 3s (1d3) and usually have animated plants as allies.</p>
		<p>Treats are not stupid, and tend to act with purpose and meaning. They especially look for those who can deal fire damage and sic their animated trees (which they summon before combat if possible) on them to take them out as quickly as possible. If they are hunting a group, they will remain motionless to attempt to surprise the enemies and start in melee range. Spellwarpers will try to position themselves where they can mimic spells maliciously.</p>

			<div class="monster-summary">

				<div class="monster-basics"><div>16 (natural armor) AC</div><div>150 (13d12 + 66) HP</div><div>Speed: 30 ft.</div></div>

				<div class="monster-details">
					<p><b>Senses:</b> passive Perception 13</p>
					<p><b>Languages:</b> Common, Metsae, Sylvan</p>
					<p><b>Ratings:</b> 8:9</p>
					<p><b>Damage Vulnerabilities</b> fire</p>
				</div>
				
			</div>
			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>False Appearance.</b></p>
				<p>While the treant remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal tree.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Siege Monster.</b></p>
				<p>The treant deals double damage to objects and structures.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Actions</h3>
			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Multiattack.</b></p>
				<p>The treant makes three slam attacks.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="monster-attack"><b>Slam.</b> <em>Melee Weapon Attack.</em> <em>+6 to hit, range 5 ft.</em> <em>Hit:</em> 3d6 + 6 bludgeoning. </p>
			<p class="monster-attack"><b>Rock.</b> <em>Melee Weapon Attack.</em> <em>+6 to hit, range 5 ft.</em> <em>Hit:</em> 4d10 + 6 bludgeoning. </p>
			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Animate Trees.</b></p>
				<p>The treant magically animates one or two trees it can see within 60 feet of it. These trees have the same statistics as a treant, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they have only the Slam action option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant. The tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies or is more than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action to turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if possible.</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Variants</h3>
			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Spellwarper.</b></p>
				<p>These treants have been warped by wild magic and that still echoes in their branches. Instead of <b>Animate Trees</b>, they have <b>Spell Echo</b>: When a creature casts a spell of aether cost 12 or lower within 30 feet of them, they can replicate the spell as a reaction, using the spell's original modifiers (including DC and spell attack modifier as appropriate) but choosing new targets. This increases their Offensive rating by 2 if there are primary offensive casters in the group and by 1 if there are characters who use healing spells regularly.</p>
