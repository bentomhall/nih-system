<h1 class="chapter" id="character-creation">Character Creation</h1>
<p>Creating a character follows a specific process.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Pick a <a href="classes/classes.html">class</a>.</li>
    <li>Pick a <a href="lineages.html">lineage</a>.</li>
    <li>Pick a <a href="cultures.html">culture</a>.</li>
    <li>Pick or design a <a href="">background</a>. Including deciding your motivations for adventuring.</li>
    <li>Assign ability scores.</li>
    <li>Pick starting gear from your chosen class.</li>
    <li>Calculate dependent values. This is HP, AC, attack bonuses, saving throw modifiers, saving throw DCs, Stamina, Aether, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>If a culture or background gives you a proficiency you already have from another source, pick a different one instead.</p>

<p>For an example of how this might work, see Appendix B (\nameref{example:character-creation}).</p>

<h2 class="section">Class</h2>
<p>Each character has a "class", which represents how they go about adventuring. It is a combination of archetype, fictional "role", approach to matters, as well as the mechanical abilities you will use during play. Classes are not necessarily formal parts of the fictional world--you may meet many people who have similar abilities, but this does not mean that all wielders of arcane power are Arcanists and have all those abilities.</p>

<p>The classes available for play are described in <a href="classes/classes.html">Classes</a>.</p>

<h2 class="section">Lineage and Culture</h2>
<p>Your character's lineage describes their biological heritage. Are they one of the tall, long-lived gwerin? Or a human? Or a draconic-souled dragonborn? Or one of many other lineages. Each lineage grants a few features, including giving a +1 to one ability score. It also describes the common heights, weights, appearance, etc. of members of that lineage.</p>

<p>The lineages available for play are described in <a href="lineages.html">Lineages</a>.</p>

<p>A character's culture describes where in the world they come from and what kind of culture they grew up with. Some cultures are more generic and others more narrow--pick what fits your character best after consultation with the GM. Each culture gives a set of features, including a +1 to one ability score. You can't pick the same ability score for this +1 as you did from your lineage--if they would overlap, pick a different one of your choice. After including both changes, no ability score can be greater than +5.</p>

<p>The lineages available for play are described in <a href="cultures.html">Cultures</a>.</p>

<h2 class="section" id="backgrounds">Backgrounds</h2>

<p>Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your armsman might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your arcanist could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester.</p>

<p>Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character's identity. The most important question to ask about your background is <em>what changed</em>? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have <em>more</em> money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background?</p>

<p>The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Proficiencies</h3>

<p>Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described in <a href="core-system.html#using-ability-scores">Using Ability Scores</a>).</p>

<p>In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools (detailed in <a href="equipment.html">Equipment</a>).</p>

<p>If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Languages</h3>

<p>Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See <a href="#languages">Languages</a> for the list.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Equipment</h3>

<p>Each background provides a package of starting equipment. This is in addition to the starting equipment listed for your class.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Questions to Consider</h3>
<p>Each sample background presents a list of questions you can use as a springboard to guide you in creating your character's history before they started adventuring. These are the sort of thing to discuss with your GM so that your story can be woven into the world and the ongoing campaign's story.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Skill Trick</h3>

<p>A background gives access to a single skill trick (see <a href="skill-tricks.html">Skill Tricks</a> for more details and the complete list). As you customize your background, you can substitute the listed skill trick for any other that uses one of the proficiencies granted by the background.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Customizing a Background</h3> 

<p>You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment section. If you spend coin, you can't also take the equipment package suggested for your class. Finally, choose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can't find a feature that matches your desired background, work with your GM to create one.</p>

<h4 class="subsub">Personality Traits</h4>
<p>Personality traits are small "tics" and mannerisms--things that your character does naturally--or other neutral facets other people can observe. These may be verbal tics, mannerisms, habits, etc. Generally these are small and neutral, just reminders for you to play off of. Unlike the bond, ideal, and flaw, they're less about being sources of plot hooks and more about characterization.</p>

<p>Ideas:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You like to use overly-large words.</li>
	<li>You talk with your hands, which can get dangerous if you happen to be armed.</li>
	<li>Given a choice, you'll never take the shortest path between two points.</li>
	<li>You have a horrible sense of direction and frequently get lost if left to your own devices.</li>
	<li>You are fastidious about your grooming, getting annoyed if you're muddy or unable to bathe frequently.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="subsub">Ideal</h4>
<p>Your ideal is something that you hold to deeply, something that you want to bring about. Different ideals can be interpreted many different ways--for one person, freedom might be being free from external restraints and going with the wind. For another, it might be about having enough power that no one tells you what to do. Choose something that your character will attempt to follow through on and seek for, but be careful about choosing things that strongly conflict with the ideals of fellow party members. Conflict of ideals isn't necessarily <em>wrong</em>, but it should be discussed openly out of character before the campaign begins so all the players are ok with it.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Freedom--you believe that everyone should be left to do as they please as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.</li>
	<li>Freedom--you don't ever want anyone to tell you what to do.</li>
	<li>Order--you believe it's best if everyone has a place and job and everyone stays in their place and does their job.</li>
	<li>Order--you believe it's best if everyone listens to you.</li>
	<li>Altruism--you believe that self-sacrifice for others is the noblest of goals.</li>
	<li>Profit--you believe that money makes the world go round.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="subsub">Bond</h4>
<p>While ideals are abstract, bonds are concrete. A person, organization, or place that you strongly want to protect, defend, regain, or help. Work with your GM to flesh out the details. A bond is supposed to act as a "plot eyebolt"--a place you've agreed with the GM that he or she can attach plot hooks and you'll bite.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Family--your family means everything to you, but you're not strong enough to defend them. Which is why you're adventuring.</li>
	<li>Family--it was taken from you/you never had it. So you're out looking for family of your own.</li>
	<li>Family--they kicked you out. So now you're looking to make your own or show them that they were wrong to do so.</li>
	<li>A mentor--you act to further his or her legacy, fulfil their last wishes, etc.</li>
	<li>A guild, company, etc.--you are an agent of a group that has sent you out on an adventure. You owe much to them.</li>
	<li>A guild, company, etc.--they kicked you out and you want to prove them wrong/revenge/get back into their graces.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="subsub">Flaw</h4>
<p>A flaw is something that gets you in trouble. Like the bond, this is a plot eyebolt. Flaws should be noticeable and make you do things that aren't "optimal", but shouldn't make the game un-fun for others by putting the campaign in jeopardy senselessly. "I attack my fellows in blind rage" is not, generally, an appropriate flaw. Neither is "I never back down".</p>

<ul>
	<li>I tend to drink more than I should.</li>
	<li>I'm an inveterate skirt-chaser (of the appropriate gender). A pretty person will turn my head and make me stop thinking as clearly.</li>
	<li>I can stop gambling whenever I choose...</li>
	<li>I'm in debt to a criminal organization.</li>
	<li>I did something really stupid, and people are after me.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="subsection">Regional Origin</h3>
<p>Every character comes from somewhere. And that origin makes a big difference. Who you know, what you know, who knows you, and what things you're good at are all part of your regional origin. Some regions have peculiarities that make some backgrounds inapposite or at least require significantly more explanation--for example, the entirely land-locked Uulan Confederacy doesn't exactly have many sailors. And the kritocracy of Byssia doesn't have nobility, but a similar background can be framed around one of the more influential (in practice, if not in law) merchant or religious families.</p>

<p>In the default setting (Dreams of Hope's Federated Nations area), the regions of orign are:</p>

<h5>Byssia</h5>
<p>Byssia lies in the southern portion of the Nocthian Caldera and parts south, including a large portion of Gap Tooth Bay. The Byssians are mostly human and ihmisi, with a very few others mingled in. The nation is a highly-decentralized state governed by judges elected from the towns and villages, although their powers are mostly executive and judicial rather than legislative. The Church of Night Reborn (worshiping the Ascendant Nocthis) and the Home of the Elements (a monastic order of elementalists and sages) both have significant de facto influence. There are no nobility, and the nation does not have a standing army. It has many militias; some of them (such as the Caldera Militia), are more organized and perpetual than others. Byssians traditionally use little metal (the costal part has no significant sources of workable metal) and venerate ascendant ancestors, Nocthis, and the kami rather than the true gods. There are very few true priests in the area, and almost no organized religion other than the Church of Night Reborn. They do not have a strong academic tradition.</p>

<h5>Giant Spine and Barrier Mountains</h5>
<p>The mountain folk of Shinevog, Zhapai Karmap, the Tuura Adam, and the Uulan Confederacy are hardy and self-sufficient. Shinevog and Zhapai Karmap are known for their "anything goes" pursuit of knowledge and money, respectively, and are home to many peoples. The Tuura Adam and the Uulan Confederacy are both traditionalist states, the former the home of most jazuu and the later home to most of the dwarven clans. Neither of the latter has any water access, and neither really has "nobility" per se. But similar backgrounds can be constructed. All three are heavily craft oriented, but much more guild and individual-oriented than the industrialized forces of Wyrmhold. None of them have standing militaries.</p>

<h5>Jungle of Fangs</h5>
<p>The Jungle lies mostly isolated from the south end of the Sea of Grass down to the Moon Sea. There are 3 nations here (Sha'slar, Asai'ka, and the Serpent Dominion), but they share most of the culture. Humans, half-elves (scaled), and ophidians are the dominant lineages, although dwarves are not uncommon. Aristocracy, merchant castes, and (in the far south), sailing are the big features. The area is uniformly religious, with heavy worship of the Queen Ascendant. Criminal organizations are quite common.</p>

<h5>Sea of Grass</h5>
<p>The Sea of Grass is a wide plain encompassing most of the largest cities. It borders Lake Coy'in heavily, with significant water traffic. The merchant nation of Rauviz, the gwerin-influenced Crisial Kingdom, the rugged Duarchy of Kotimaa, and the theocratic Holy Kaelthian Republic, the latter 3 of which are the most expansive nations in the area, are the dominant powers. Humans, halflings, gwerin, and dwarves are the dominant lineages. Any background is appropriate here.</p>

<h5>Wyrmhold</h5>
<p>Wyrmhold is a highly militarized and industrial neighbor occupying the eastern flank of the Nocthian Caldera and the adjoining Kairen Mountains, as well as the southern part of the Fiach Wood and western part of the Lupaus Plains. Populated primarily by dragonborn, orcs, and goblins, there are jazuu in the high mountains as well. Other lineages only occur as migrants in the last decade or so. A clan-based aristocracy ruled by a queen, the nation has a strong and proud military tradition. They are also the second-most technologically advanced nation of the area--Shinevog beats them out. But they have a much deeper industrial base (albeit mostly military focused until very recently). They have little water access and are not generally known for their trading or merchant prowess.</p>

<p>For sample backgrounds, see <a href="backgrounds.html">Sample Backgrounds</a></p>

<h2 class="section" id="alignment">Alignment</h2>
<p>Alignment is not in effect, except descriptively. Instead, come up with two adjectives that describe your character's default reaction to things. </p>

<h2 class="section" id="languages">Languages</h2>
<p>Your culture indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.</p>

<p>Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. With your GM's permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table.</p>

<p>Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another.</p>

<h2 class="section">Ability Scores</h2>
<p>To generate ability scores, choose from the following methods after discussion with your GM. Either way, you shouldn't end up with any ability scores above +4 or below -4. Your lineage and culture will adjust these later, each adding +1 to one score.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
    <h3>Expected Values For Ability Scores</h3>
	<p>The average for a normal, non-adventuring person is +0 in each score. Ability scores represent as much <em>archetypes</em> or <em>approaches</em> as they do physical parameters. Someone with high Dexterity and low Strength may be "strong"--wielding a bow (which requires Dexterity) also requires substantial physical strength. But the way they approach matters is more nimble, dextrous, and subtle. In appearance, they'd be less muscle-bound and more lean--more of a runner's build than a bodybuilder's build.</p>

	<p>Generally, you'll want your highest ability score to be in your class's primary score. That is:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Arcanist: Intelligence</li>
		<li>Armsman: Strength (if you want heavy armor) or Dexterity (for light armor)</li>
		<li>Brawler: Either Dexterity or Wisdom</li>
		<li>Oathbound: Either Strength or Charisma</li>
		<li>Priest: Wisdom</li>
		<li>Ranger: Dexterity</li>
		<li>Rogue: Dexterity</li>
		<li>Shaman: Wisdom</li>
		<li>Spellblade: Charisma</li>
		<li>Warden: Strength</li>
		<li>Warlock: Charisma</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Many classes (especially Brawler, Oathbound, Ranger, and Spellblade) want your second highest score in one other particular score (called a secondary ability score). Some subclasses, chosen at level 3 generally, also key off of certain ability scores.</p>

	<p>As a general rule, your Constitution score should be positive, but doesn't need to be your highest score.</p>
</div>

<h5>Standard Array</h5>
<p>The standard array provides a fixed, consistent set of values for play. It trades the ability to get unusually high ability scores for the surety of not getting unusually low ability scores.</p>

<p>To use the Standard Array, distribute the following values among your ability scores in whatever order you choose: +2, +2, +1, +1, 0, -1.</p>

<h5>Rolled Scores</h5>
<p>Rolling provides a bit of risk in return for possible reward. It can produce widely varying attributes between party members, and so should be done with care.</p>

<p>To roll ability scores, follow the following process:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Roll 4d6 and sum the highest 3 (effectively discarding the lowest).</li>
	<li>Subtract 10 from the resulting score.</li>
	<li>Divide the result by 2, rounding toward negative numbers (ie -5 divided by 2 becomes -3).</li>
	<li>Repeat the above steps until you have 6 numbers, then assign them to your ability scores in whatever order you choose.</li>
</ol>

<h2 class="section" id="advancement">Advancement</h2>
Characters are expected to grow in power in multiple ways. One primary way is by <b>gaining levels</b> (as explained below). This represents both horizontal growth (gaining new powers and capabilities) and vertical growth (becoming stronger in pre-existing powers and capabilities). Other primary avenues of growth are through finding allies, gaining reputations (for good or for ill), finding magical items, and gaining mystic boons.

<h3 class="subsection" id="beyond-first-level">Beyond 1st Level</h3>

<p>As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called <b>gaining a level</b>.</p>

<p>When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase one of your ability scores (usually by 1). You can't increase an ability score above +5 unless the feature explicitly says so. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.</p>

<p>Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. This increases your maximum hit points by the average result of the die roll (rounded up) or half the maximum value of the die, plus 1 (which is the same result). Your maximum hit points also increase by your Constitution modifier. For example, a warden gains 7 (12 / 2 + 1) hit points from each additional hit die plus the value of his Constitution modifier.</p>

<p>When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your 7th-level armsman has a Constitution score of +3, when he reaches 8th level and chooses to increase his Constitution score to +4, his hit point maximum then increases by 8.</p>

<p>The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your character's class description to see what other improvements you gain at each level.</p>

<div class="comment">
    <h3>XP and Advancement</h3>
    The expectation is that 1 XP ~ 1 session of serious play, regardless of what's accomplished, fought, or done during the session. GMs can provide extra XP for good play or not award XP if the party just sits around and dithers, but should do so sparingly. Two paths are presented--slow and fast. Slow expects it to take a number of sessions (XP) equal to your current level until level 6, at which point it stabilizes as 6/level. Fast caps at 4. A Fast-path advancement will take a party 1-20 in just over a year of weekly play (71 sessions, about 14 months), while a slow advancement path will take just shy of two years (100 sessions). The goal here is to keep the first few levels (often called the Journeyman Stage) quite fast, and then slow down to a fixed pace.
