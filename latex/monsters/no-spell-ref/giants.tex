\section{Giants}
Giants in all their forms descend from the ancient titans. Contrary to the name, titans were of reasonably normal stature. But they possessed the power of True Words in the form of runes, often inscribed on their bodies. These runes gave them control over matter, allowing them to transform into hulking figures many tens of feet (some even a hundred) feet tall and with strength to move mountains.

After the Titan-Wyrm wars and the treachery of Isskap with the Orb of All Might, the titans' runic power was broken, leaving them incapable of voluntarily transforming; the result were the ancestors of today's jazuu and dwarves (the latter being those whose power was stripped to create the Orb in the first place). Instead, the last remnants of their power went into the creation of the Titanwalls, runic constructs that could rewrite a jazuu, transforming them permanently into a true giant...if they survived and were able to control the process. Those who failed to control the transformation or who bailed out early became the giant-kin. In a cruel twist of fate, true giants are sterile, but giant-kin breed true. Thus, true giants are rare, but giant-kin have spread throughout all the continents of Quartus.
\subsection{True Giants}
The transformation at a Titanwall can be likened to a reprogramming--one translation goes as follows.
\begin{verbatim}
