	<h2 class="section" id="conditions">Appendix A: Conditions</h2>
	<p>Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.</p>
	
	<p>A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.</p>
	
	<p>If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.</p>
	
	<p>The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.</p>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="blinded">Blinded</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.</li>
		<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="bloodied">Bloodied</h3>
	<p>Bloodied, by itself, does little. It is automatically applied to any creature whose hit points are below half of its maximum.</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Deflect, exert, and focus cost double.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="broken">Broken</h3>
	<p>The default way of imposing the broken condition is by the creature failing a Wisdom saving throw against Morale effects. Some other abilities may impose it. It lasts for one round at minimum, or more if appropriate. Mindless creatures are immune to being broken.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A broken creature focuses their attention on personal survival. This may mean surrendering, fleeing, or taking the Total Defense action if they can't get away.</li>
		<li>Broken creatures rarely attack, but if they do they do so at disadvantage.</li>
		<li>Attacks against broken creatures are at advantage.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="charmed">Charmed</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.</li>
	<li>The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="deafened">Deafened</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="exhaustion">Exhaustion</h3>
	
	<p>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</p>
	
	<p>Each level of exhaustion (up to five levels) adds a cumulative -1 modifier to all checks, saves, and attacks. It also decreases the save DC of your abilities and spells by 1. Upon taking a 6th level of exhaustion, you are incapacitated until you no longer have 6 levels.</p>
	
	<p>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</p>
	
	<p>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</p>
	
	<p>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink (or was incapacitated with 6 levels).</p>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="frightened">Frightened</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.</li>
	<li>The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="grappled">Grappled</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.</li>
	<li>The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see <a href="#incapacitated">the incapacitated condition</a>).</li>
	<li>The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the <em>thunder wave</em> spell. The reverse also holds--effects that move the grappler out of reach of the grappled creature end the grapple as well.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="hidden">Hidden</h3>
	<p>Hidden is a <em>relative</em> condition--you can be hidden from one creature and not from another. To become hidden, you must either be impossible to detect by the other creature--have total concealment, be unable to be heard (such as by the <a href="spells/allspells.html#silence">silence</a> spell), and be unable to be smelled or otherwise sensed (via senses like tremorsense or blindsight)--or have successfully taken the Hide action (which requires total concealment) and beaten that creature's Passive Perception.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A hidden creature has advantage on their first attack against a creature they're hidden from. Hit or miss, the hidden condition then ends for any creature that could see the attack happen.</li>
		<li>A hidden creature is automatically revealed if they move out of total concealment.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="incapacitated">Incapacitated</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions. They can still move and speak, if falteringly.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="invisible">Invisible</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is totally concealed. The creature's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.</li>
	<li>Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="paralyzed">Paralyzed</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>A paralyzed creature is <a href="incapacitated">incapacitated</a> and can't move or speak.</li>
	<li>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
	<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
	<li>Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="petrified">Petrified</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.</li>
	<li>The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can't move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.</li>
	<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
	<li>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
	<li>The creature has resistance to all damage.</li>
	<li>The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="poisoned">Poisoned</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.</li>
	<li>Targets of spells and other effects caused by the poisoned creature have advantage on any necessary saving throw.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="prone">Prone</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.</li>
	<li>The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.</li>
	<li>An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="restrained">Restrained</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>A restrained creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.</li>
	<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.</li>
	<li>The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="shaken">Shaken</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A shaken creature cannot take reactions.</li>
		<li>A shaken creature's speed is reduced to half.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="staggered">Staggered</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>A staggered creature has disadvantage on attack rolls </li>
		<li>A staggered creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and ability checks.</li>
		<li>A staggered creature that attempts to cast a spell must make a Constitution saving throw with DC = 8 + the aether cost of the spell. On a failed save, the spell does not take effect and the action is lost but the aether is not expended.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="stunned">Stunned</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>A stunned creature is <a href="#incapacitated">incapacitated</a>, can't move, and can speak only falteringly.</li>
	<li>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
	<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="surprised">Surprised</h3>
	<p>This condition is applied only on the first round of combat and automatically ends at the end of the affected person's first turn.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A surprised creature cannot take actions or reactions and cannot move. </li>
		<li>Surprised creatures still roll for initiative normally and take their turn. They can speak, but this speech cannot clear the surprised condition for other creatures in that encounter.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3 class="subsection" id="unconscious">Unconscious</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>An unconscious creature is <a href="#incapacitated">incapacitated</a>, can't move or speak, and has disadvantage on any hearing-based check to perceive its surroundings. It automatically fails any sight-based attempt to perceive its surroundings.</li>
	<li>The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls prone.</li>
	<li>The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</li>
	<li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.</li>
	<li>Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.</li>
	</ul>
