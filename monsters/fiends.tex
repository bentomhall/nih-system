\section{Fiends}
"Fiend" is the word used by mortals to describe any resident of the Astral or Abyssal (few make a differentiation, although the differences are many) summoned via ritual or magic into another plane as weapons or soldiers and given a body woven of aether to inhabit. These "combat forms" have become quite standardized over the centuries, chosen as much for their intimidating looks as for their raw combat potential. One side effect of this new form is that killing a fiend on the Mortal requires trapping their core essence and dispersing it--simply shattering the body by physical or magical force just ends the spell and sends them back to where they came from. It does irritate them considerably though; they can feel pain in their borrowed forms just like in their "true" forms.

The more powerful the summoned entity, the greater expenditure of aether is required to house it. A Flame Fiend, for example, is one of the most potent of its kind and can summon others subservient to it, while an imp or a dretch are the lowliest, the latter barely capable of thought.

Such aether-born shells, however, do have a weakness to silver, as it disrupts the complex patterns that contain their otherplanar essence. Damage done by silvered weapons leaves them weakened, if just for a moment.

\begin{figure}
	\begin{DndComment}{Hierarchy of Fiend Forms}
		Stronger entities require larger, more expensive shells. Some particularly powerful entities, such as diabolical dons or demon princes, cannot be summoned by normal means--no summoner or ritual has enough power to create a stable body for them. They can appear via rifts, but they do so in their own proper form.

		The hierarchy of regularly summoned forms goes (from weakest to strongest)
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Stench fiends. These are barely sapient, merely a squggle of a fragment of a True Word at their core. Only the weakest summoners summon these, but other fiends often employ them as cannon fodder.
			\item Imps. These are the lowest forms regularly summoned--they are common familiars. They trade their freedom for an ongoing piece of the summoner's energy or a claim on their soul (if demon). Scouts, messengers, and gossips mostly, they are fragile in combat.
			\item Succubi/Incubi. The form used depends on the needs of the caster, not the entity's innate nature. Commonly used for means other than combat.
			\item Bearded fiends, hell hounds, and barbed fiends. These are the workhorse fiendish form, probably the most commonly summoned type for actual combat.
			\item Fury, Horned, Bone, and Ice fiends. These are the commanders. Often capable of summoning large numbers of others.
			\item Flame fiends. These are the pinnacle of the summonable forms, acting as generals. Those more powerful than this cannot generally be summoned.

\DndMonsterAction{Fetid Cloud (1/Day)}
A 10-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from the stench fiend. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions.

\DndMonsterAction{Shapechanger} The fiend can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Without wings, the fiend loses its flying speed. Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

\DndMonsterAction{Charm}
One humanoid the fiend can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day. The charmed target obeys the fiend's verbal or telepathic commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this fiend's Charm for the next 24 hours.

The fiend can have only one target charmed at a time. If it charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.

\DndMonsterAction{Draining Kiss}
The fiend kisses a creature charmed by it or a willing creature. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 32 (5d10 + 5) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
\DndMonsterAction{Etherealness}
The fiend magically enters the Border Shadow from the Mortal Plane, or vice versa.

The fiend magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up to 20 feet in diameter.

When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the fiend is incapacitated or dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the wall vanishes.

For purposes of \nameref{spell:unbind}, this counts as a spell of aether cost 12.
