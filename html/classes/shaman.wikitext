The shaman is the pure devotee of the primal powers, the spirits of nature and the elements. They call on elemental forces to create Manifest Zones to blast their foes and hamper them while aiding allies.

Not particularly suited to front-line assault or direct blasting, they specialize in controlling and hampering enemies and secondarily in supporting allies through healing and other means.

Design Discussion: Replaces the druid. No wild shape. UCT is manifest zones: basically placeable aoes. Heavily control-oriented. SDCT 5/4/7/4.
