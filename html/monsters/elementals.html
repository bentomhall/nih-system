<h2 class="section">Elementals</h2>

<p>Elementals are born from the essence and Names of the elemental planes. Some are descendents of mortals who gave up their mortality (and ability to grow) in exchange for being tied to the nature of the plane; others are pure embodiments of the Word at the heart of each plane. True elementals (such as the ones named like Air/Earth/Fire/Water Elemental) are barely sapient and have little free will--they are not much more than elemental beasts. Those descended from mortals are much more "intelligent" and free-willed.</p>
