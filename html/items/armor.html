		<h2 class="section">Armor, Magic</h2>
		
		<p>This section contains the various magic items that are worn as armor or clothing, as well as shields.</p>
		
		<h4>Boots, belts, cloaks, gloves, and helmets</h4>
		<p>Even though many types of armor (especially heavy armor) have integrated sabatons (armored boots), belts, gauntlets, and helmets, you can wear magic items listed as boots, belts, cloaks, gloves (or gauntlets), or helmets (or hats) without reducing the protective qualities of the armor. Some magic items (such as the Demon Armor) may impose more specific restrictions. You must wear both of a pair of magic gloves or magic boots to gain any benefit from them. You can only gain the benefits of one pair of boots, one cloak, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one helmet or hat, and one belt at the same time, even if they do not require attunement.</p>
		
		<h4>Robes</h4>
		<p>Robes cannot be worn with any armor, magical or not, except a mithral breastplate or chain shirt (or armor like Aelven Chain, which acts as a mithral chain shirt).</p>

				<h3 class="item-name">Adamantine Armor</h3>
		
				<div class="item-type">Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide)</div>
				<div class="rarity">Adventurer</div>
			</div>
			
			<p>This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you're wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.</p>
		
			<p class="formula"><b>Formula</b> To craft Adamantine Armor, you must procure one-quarter of the weight of the armor in refined adamantine metal (three-quarters of the weight in raw adamantine ore). The cost of the crafting is twice the base price of the armor, four times if you wish to have masterwork adamantine armor. Crafting adamantine armor requires a +3 proficiency bonus (+4 if you are crafting masterwork) and proficiency in smith's tools.</p>
