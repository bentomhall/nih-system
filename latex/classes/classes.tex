\begin{DndComment}{Commentary on Classes}
Classes are archetypes for playing the game. They represent a tiny slice of the wild and wonderful variation in the world. While playing NIH System, you may encounter creatures, including other "normal" humanoids who have abilities reminiscent of class abilities and those with entirely other abilities that no class offers. Even if they are called "warrior" or "rogue" or "oathbound", they may not have all the abilities of a member of that class and may in fact have others unattainable in game. Every individual is different, but the classes represent packages of abilities balanced and suited for play as an adventurer. They are not "real" in the context of the fictional world.
