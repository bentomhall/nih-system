\section{Arcanist}

Design goals: The arcanist is the basic full-caster arcane magic user, replacing the sorcerer and wizard. Their UCT is Metamagic, which will be expanded to do a whole lot more. SDCT: 3/7/7/3

Subclasses:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Awakened: This is the self-taught "savant", whose powers are more instinctual than trained. They'll get more aether and some CHA-based abilities.
	\item Book Mage: This is the closest to your classic "wizard". They'll get the ability to write in spells to have them always known and not counting against their limits, plus Ritual Caster.
	\item Warmage: This Approach focuses on attacking. Gets motes when using metamagic, which do various things. Best at amplifying damage of spells. Gets light armor and some weapons.
\end{itemize}

\end{DndTable}

\subsection{Spellcasting}

You have acquired a talent for arcane magic. The art of weaving patterns in aether that change the world around you.

\subsection{Cantrips}

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the arcanist spell list. You learn additional arcanist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Arcanist table.

\subsubsection{Preparing and Casting Spells}

\nameref{tbl:arcanist} table shows how much aether (AET) you have to cast your spells and do other magical tasks. To cast a spell that requires aether, you must expend aether equal to its cost or greater. You regain all expended aether when you finish a long rest. It also shows your Aether Limit, which is the maximum aether you can expend on a single action.

You know a certain number of arcanist spells, choosing from the arcanist spell list. You can trade out any known spell for any other spell you can learn from that list when you finish a long rest. When you do so, choose a number of arcanist spells from your list as shown on the \nameref{tbl:arcanist} table. To prepare a spell you must be able to cast it without exceeding your Aether Limit.

\subsection{Spellcasting Ability}

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your arcanist spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to understand and recall the complex patterns of arcane magic. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a arcanist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

\textbf{Spell save DC} = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

\textbf{Spell attack modifier} = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

\subsection{Spellcasting Focus}

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your arcanist spells.

\subsection{Arcane Approach}

Choose a arcane Approach, which describes the source of your magical training: Awakened Mage, Book Mage, or Warmage, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

\subsection{Font of Magic}

At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. When you finish a short rest, you can recover aether equal to your arcanist level, rounded up. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

\subsection{Metamagic}

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You learn all of the metamagic below.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

\subsection{Careful Spell}

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 AET and choose a number of those creatures up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.

\subsection{Distant Spell}

When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 AET to double the range of the spell.

When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 AET to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

\subsection{Empowered Spell}

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 AET to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

\subsection{Extended Spell}

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 AET to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

\subsection{Heightened Spell}

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist or remove its effects, you can spend 3 AETs to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its saving throws made against the spell.

\subsection{Quickened Spell}

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 AET to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

\subsection{Reshape Spell}
When you cast a spell that affects an area, you can spend 1 or more AET to change the shape of the spell. Choose one of the following.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Increase the area of the spell. Increasing the radius of a spherical or circular effect (including a cylinder) costs 2 AET per 5 ft increase. Increasing the length of a line effect or a cone costs 1 AET per 5 ft increase.
  \item Exclude one or more 5 ft cubes from the area of effect. This costs 1 AET per 2 cubes excluded.
  \item Concentrate the effect. This reduces the primary dimension (radius or length) of the spell to 1/2 of its original value (a 20 ft radius becomes a 10 ft radius, etc), but targets have disadvantage on the saving throw. This only affects spells that affect all creatures or objects in an area. This costs 4 AET.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Subtle Spell}

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 AET to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

\subsection{Twinned Spell}

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend an amount of AET equal to 1/2 the spell's cost to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 AET if the spell is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, \textit{magic missile} and \textit{scorching ray} aren't eligible, but \textit{ray of frost} and \textit{chromatic orb} are.

\subsection{Ability Score Improvement}

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 1. As normal, you cannot increase an ability score beyond +5 with this feature.

You can also pick a Skill Trick (included in the skill tricks column of the \nameref{tbl:arcanist} table) but you must meet the prerequisites for skill tricks learned in this way. See \nameref{ch:skill-tricks} for that list.

\subsection{Sorcerous Restoration}

At 20th level, you regain 4 expended AETs whenever you finish a short rest.

\subsection{Arcane Approaches}

Wizard, sorcerer, mage. Different names for the same thing. A wielder of arcane magic. Each arcanist approaches things slightly differently, but there are decided similarities in how they gained and further their mastery of arcane power.

\subsubsection{Awakened Mage}
