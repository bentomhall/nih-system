\section{How to use this document}
This is an auxiliary document for Game Masters (GMs) of the NIH TTRPG system. It's not needed to play the game, but is designed to answer questions GMs might have and to provide additional helps, including guidance on treasure distribution, encounter building, setting DCs for checks, etc. There is no expectation that players will or will not read it. It does not contain \textit{rules}---everything here is couched as \textit{guidance and suggestions}. The tone is intended to be much less formal than the main play document, as it's friendly advice from one long-running GM to another, as well as a frank discussion of how I, as the designer, was thinking the game would be run. Feel free to deviate from this guidance if your table needs something different. That's a core principle of NIH---no one can know better what your table needs than you do. You're the final authority on that subject. As a game designer, all I can do is point out pitfalls I've seen and solutions that have worked at other tables. Consider this document to be a toolkit.

\subsection{Core Principles}
NIH is built around a few core principles.
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \textbf{The focus is the PCs.} This is the story of the player characters and their heroics (or heroic failures). They are the ones shaping the narrative by their actions and the consequences of those actions. Things that boil down to bookeeping or get in the way of that should be the first things to go when something has to be ditched. This also means that it's not \textit{your} story that's being told, although you're a critical part of it.
    \item[] \textbf{The party's fun outweighs all rules.} As the GM, you are the final backstop for the table's fun. Each player has a substantial responsibility to help themselves and their party have fun. But you're the last resort. Not the rules. "Sorry, I have to do this horribly unfun thing because the rules say so" is a \textit{dodge}, an attempt to shirk your responsibility to the party. Now there are certainly things that aren't immediately fun. For example, a PC dying. But maintaining those systems helps the party have fun long-term (most of the time) because a lack of consequences often robs the game of depth. So it's a tricky, table-by-table balance. But certainly, people on the internet or even these rules themselves are going to be worse at maintaining that balance than you will be. Because we can't see what you're dealing with and don't know the people involved.
    \item[] \textbf{You are a player too and so deserve to have fun.} A GM is a critical moving piece of the system. Very few things kill games faster than the GM getting burnt out or losing interest or feeling like they're just going through the motions. Work with your party if you start to feel that way. Talk out of character. Make whatever changes are necessary. Don't feel like you need to sacrifice yourself on the altar of their fun---come to a mutually beneficial solution or stop playing.
    \item[] \textbf{Player agency is important.} Agency is the feeling that your decisions matter. When players don't feel like they have agency, they tend to check out or start acting badly, trying to break things to regain a sense of agency (or as a form of protest). And this is generally bad. Player agency is maintained when players make informed decisions with actual consequences. It doesn't mean they have to have \textit{total} freedom to choose anything, and they certainly don't get to choose the consequences. But throughout the game, they have to be able to make choices that matter. If you're going to do a set piece that requires them to fail, get them to agree to it out of character first. Or do something differently. Both because otherwise you'll probably end up with a broken story (players are notorious for \textit{not} generally wanting to fail and doing all sorts of things to get out of it) and you'll hurt your relationship with the players if you try to force the issue.
    \item[] \textbf{The PCs are working together against the enemies, not each other.} NIH is not designed for player-vs-player action. It's designed for the party working as a (mostly) cohesive group against monstrous foes and challenges. But remember that many abilities do affect everyone. I generally add a check when someone is going to, for example, hit another PC with a \textit{fireball} spell---I check with the threatened PC. If they're not ok, I ask the other player to choose a different target or different spell. PvP actions only resolve if all affected players are ok with it. Stealing from the group or getting the group in serious trouble (such as by attacking a king in his court) are, in my mind, pvp actions.
    \item[] \textbf{The monsters are the enemy, not you.} You will be called on to portray antagonists. That does \textit{not} mean you yourself should be antagonistic to the player or the PCs. That's not a fair fight---the GM automatically wins. And that's bad. You, acting as players' window to the world, shouldn't lie to the players. They may not be observing the real truth (due to failed rolls or illusions or whatever), but your job is to accurately portray what their characters experience. Similarly, you shouldn't act out of malice or desire to hurt the characters or the players. The monsters certainly want to hurt the characters, but that's their problem.
    \item[] \textbf{The monsters generally lose.} NIH is a game about heroes. And the basic assumption is that the heroes will win, eventually. Not all the time, but most fights should end up going their way. When they lose, it should be because they messed up, made bad choices, didn't do their research, etc. Not because you threw a "rocks fall, everyone dies" no-win scenario. And loss may or may not mean \textit{death}. An average party will face dozens if not hundreds of fights over their campaign. If they had an average fatality rate of even 5\%, the chances of having no deaths is under 75\% by the 6th fight and under 35\% by the 20th. 
    \item[] \textbf{Out of character problems need out of character solutions.} If someone is causing issues, talk to them. Seriously. And kindly. Not accusing, not angry. Solve out of character problems out of character. Trying to "punish" their character for the player being bad rarely, if ever, works. It usually just makes things worse for everyone via escalation. The game system isn't designed to help you solve people problems. No rules can stop a malicious actor. In the end, it comes down to only playing with people you trust.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Layout of this document}
This document is divided into several sections that each cover a specific chunk of running the game.
\begin{itemize}
    \item This current section discusses how to use this document.
    \item \nameref{sec:resolving-checks} discusses the role of dice in resolving checks (attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws). It discusses different ways to set DCs, and what the DC values are intended to mean, as well as gives a few more examples as to when one proficiency might be more appropriate than others. It lightly touches on non-binary resolutions (aka degrees of success/failure) and when you'd want (or not want) to use those.
    \item \nameref{sec:encounter-design} discusses different models for designing both individual encounters or challenges as well as "adventures" (strings of connected challenges). It discusses particular gotchas commonly encountered, and gives some guidance on manipulating the difficulty to be what you want it to be.
    \item \nameref{sec:treasure} discusses the expectations for treasure distribution, as well as presenting ways to randomly generate "appropriate" treasure.
    \item \nameref{sec:worldbuilding} discusses the system's expectations around the world you play in. There is a default setting for NIH, but it's not binding.
    \item \nameref{sec:sample-adventure} presents a sample (short) adventure for level 1-3 characters, designed to quickly introduce people to the system, especially for new GMs. Although it takes place in Quartus, it is designed to be "low lore" and transplantable into any setting.
\end{itemize}

\section{Resolving Checks}\label{sec:resolving-checks}
The mechanical core of NIH is using a d20 to resolve \textit{uncertainty}. If it's already clear from the fiction what should happen, adding dice rolls is at best fluff and at worse confusing. Now, rolling dice is fun for many people. And I don't want to discount that. But in general, the safest guiding principle behind any attack roll, ability check, or saving throw is "is this a situation where both success and failure are plausible outcomes and, more importantly, \textit{interesting, acceptable} outcomes with interesting consequences that move the narrative along." If the answer to either of those questions is no, \textit{don't roll. Just narrate.} This takes some finesse on the GM's part. There are differences between the different kinds of checks, so let's look at those in more detail.

\subsection{Attack Rolls}
NIH is a game about heroes and villains worthy of heros. So most of the time, if the task is "can I damage that creature", there is meaningful uncertainty. Even a completely unaware enemy might flinch out of the way at a critical moment. Even if asleep. And even attacking an object under stress can fail. And with attack rolls, a natural 1 is a miss and a natural 20 is a hit, regardless of the AC. So generally, a player asking to attack something will be resolved with an attack roll.

There are exceptions. A party or NPC might decide to kill creatures that, in the fiction, pose them no threat and that they should be able to defeat without problem (such as a villain kicking a puppy). In this case, there's little reason to spend the extra time to roll the attack---we can just simply move along to the consequences of them hitting. Similarly, a character trying to break an enchanted adamantine wall with a wooden toothpick doesn't require an attack roll---he simply cannot do that. Simply narrate the failure of the attack. In cases like this, there is one situation where rolling might be useful---to decide \textit{how messy} the successful attack is or \texit{how bad} the failure is. That's covered in \nameref{subsec:degrees-of-success}.

\subsection{Saving Throws}
Nobody likes feeling powerless. It's a rare circumstance that a PC will not be able to make a saving throw against an effect---basically unless they are subjected to a condition that imposes automatic failures (such as \smartnameref{condition:paralyzed}{the Paralyzed condition} against Dexterity saving throws), they will be able to at least attempt the saving throw. And the consequences are almost always meaningful---death, damage, or a disabling condition. As a result, saving throws are almost always useful to roll and play out.

There are a few exceptions, discussed below. In all of them, the core principle is \textit{to keep the focus on the party and keep the narrative moving.} NIH is not a physics engine; it's a toolkit designed to help you bring narratives to life and figure out what happens to the party and their goals.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If there isn't anything threatening the party and they're not under time pressure and the condition naturally resolves given time. For example, a slippery slope where the only consequence is falling prone, but no other threat looms. Since all this does is slightly slow down the party, rolling might not be all that important. Just narrate how they slip around and have to move carefully and move on to more important things.
    \item If a damaging effect will do more than the monster's hit points even if halved, don't bother rolling saving throws for them. They can't survive even if they pass the saving throw. This is particularly common at higher levels facing off against a horde of small creatures such as bandits targeted by \textit{fireball}.
    \item If it's just set dressing and the party isn't directly involved. A dragon doing a drive-by flaming of a camp of guards and commoners just kills however many of them as is thematically appropriate. Important NPCs may get saves if narratively appropriate.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ability Checks}
Unlike attack rolls and saving throws, ability checks are rarely the result of a fixed ability and thus require more GM adjudication. The same basic principles (only roll when the outcome is uncertain, both results are acceptable both in the narrative and to the table's culture, and both results are interesting) apply, but there's the additional need to set a DC. At the end of the day, the exact value you decide for the DC isn't \textit{that} important, as long as it's reasonable. Don't worry too much about distinguishing a 16 from a 17---it's totally fine to only ever use one of four options (and the fourth very rarely): 10, 15, 20, and 25 (discussed below).

\subsubsection{Resolving Actions Without Fixed Features}
When there isn't a fixed character or monster feature involved in a player or monster's actions, there's a short process you'll have to go through to resolve the action and decide what happens next.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Decide if any mechanical resolution is actually necessary. Use the core principles here:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Is the proposed action impossible? If so, and if the character would reasonably \textit{know} that (even if the player doesn't), I recommend informing the player of that fact and letting them do something else without wasting their action or resources. If the character wouldn't know, simply resolve the attempt as a failure. This should be used sparingly---for things that aren't logical or physical impossiblities (and are merely unlikely), it's often better to let them try and set a high DC. Note that if there is a range of outcomes for failure that could depend on how well you do at an otherwise impossible task, it might be better to use a non-binary check (described below).
        \item Is the proposed action unlikely to fail, given the narrative circumstances? Alternatively, would it be a breach of estabilshed characterization for that routine action to fail? For example, a professional chef will rarely, if ever, have a routine dish (one they cook frequently) just fail. And it would be weird if even 5\% of the time a trained sailor couldn't balance on the mast during normal weather conditions. In these cases, simply resolve the action as a success and move on. This one can be used liberally---players love feeling important. Especially if narrated that this is something most people would have to roll for, but this character is just that awesome. Similarly to above, if there are a range of success options that depend on how well you do (but no failure case), it might be better to use a non-binary check (in this case degrees of success, rather than degrees of failure).
        \item Are there actual consequences that matter and are interesting for both success and failure? This combines a few factors. If there isn't any factor preventing the person from trying again until they succeed and time \textit{doesn't} matter...simply let them succeed. If time \textit{does} matter, but there aren't any other meaningful consequences of failing other than having to try again, a simple ruling is to allow them to automatically succeed at the cost of taking 10 times as much time as normal (defaulting to taking 1 minute, or 10 rounds).
        \item Are you ok with the outcomes of both success and failure? If not, simply narrate whichever one you \textit{are} ok with or change the outcome to be something you can be ok with. In this case, we don't want to let the dice or the rules override our own knowledge of what is fun. \textbf{CAUTION:} Using this to force your preferred narrative denies players their agency and is one form of railroading. This lever is best only pulled when something critically un-fun (as judged by your party) would happen. For many parties, an example might be an ignominious, pointless death for something simple. Instead of a party member falling to their death on a failed Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land safely from a risky jump (narratively slipping off the edge of a huge cliff), instead they might succeed at balancing (success on the check) at a cost---maybe they lose something from their pack, take an injury (mechanically implemented by a level of exhaustion, etc), or something like that. Similarly, if a party would get deadlocked on a quest if they failed an Intelligence (Investigation) check and not be able to make any more progress, don't have them make that check. They simply find the needed information. Find a different way of testing them.
        \item Is this something the person is doing routinely, rather than a focused effort? Use a passive check (10 + the relevant modifiers) instead of an active one. The most common use of this is Wisdom (Perception) to avoid being surprised.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Once you've decided that a check is, after all, necessary, you need to decide \textit{what kind of check} is needed. This involves picking an ability score and possibly one or more sources of proficiency to add. There is no extra bonus for a character having proficiency from more than one source on a given check, generally.
    \item Now it's time to pick a DC.
    \item Now determine whether there are other circumstances, not rolled into the DC, that either give the PC a boost or a penalty (ie decide whether the check is at advantage or disadvantage). Examples include having someone else Help (granting advantage) or wearing certain types of armor while trying to sneak (disadvantage on the Dexterity (Stealth) check).
    \item After that, you resolve the check by having the player roll and comparing the result to the DC, as usual.
    \item Finish up by narrating the results and handling any mechanical consequences (lost hit points, death, consumed resources, etc.)
\end{enumerate} 

\subsubsection{Ability Scores and Checks}
Ability checks only optionally include proficiency in a skill, tool, or something else---they're listed as [Ability Score]([List of possible proficiencies]) (e.g. Strength (Athletics) would be a Strength check that includes proficiency/expertise if the one making the check is proficient, while a bare Strength check doesn't include proficiency). That said, \textit{most} checks you make on a day-to-day basis will involve some source of proficiency, often from a skill. While skills are tied to an ability score by default (such as Athletics defaulting to Strength), it is totally fine to apply the proficiency to a check for a different ability score if that makes more sense. The canonical example is using Intimidation (normally a Charisma skill relying on verbal threats) with Strength---this might represent a \textit{wordless} intimidation check, such as by bending the target's weapon in half with your bare hands or casually hefting a huge boulder over their head. There are a few traps to avoid, however.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Letting characters always use their focused ability score. For example, letting the rogue jump longer distances using Dexterity (Acrobatics) instead of Strength (Athletics). This cheapens the game by not having consequences for different choices. Some ability scores are used more than others---for example Dexterity is referred to more than Strength. By letting people do things with Dexterity that should be done with Strength, it provides incentives to use Dexterity and leave Strength out, which harms those classes that are focused on Strength.
    \item Being too rigid about what applies. The GM's role is to decide what checks are called for---players do not call for checks, they describe actions. On the flip side, you should be willing to negotiate with players if they want to, for example, substitute one source of proficiency for a different one. A tactic to use here is to change the narrated result depending on which proficiency they rely on. This is easiest for Intelligence-based "lore checks"---give them different information for an Intelligence (History) check than an Intelligence (Religion) check. On both, a success should give meaningful (in the context of the check) information, but the viewpoint may be different depending on what they're going for.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Deciding the DC}
The higher the DC, the harder the check. In general, DCs in NIH are context dependent, including who is making the check. This does not mean that the DC is higher for a character with a low ability score (or vice versa). But a noble-born character interacting with nobility may be the only one who \textit{can even possibly make the attempt}, even if they have a low Charisma. Or, if that particular character has annoyed the NPC in question, the DC to get their desired result may be higher. And DCs are generally not constant---it's really rare that the party attempts to climb the same wall multiple times and has to roll for it.

Generally, setting the DC is the second-to-last part of resolving the check.
