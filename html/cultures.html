	<h2 class="section">Cultures</h2>
	<p>Choose a culture that fits the origin of your character.  You gain the features listed below. If the ability score increase would take your total increase from lineage and background above +2, choose a different one (subject to the same limitation).</p>
	
	In general, any lineage can come from any culture. Restrictions are as noted in each description. Cultures specify
	<ul>
	<li>Region (where they're mostly found)</li>
	<li>Ability Score Increase (+1 to one ability score from the list given, cannot overlap with your lineage choice--if it does, pick a different one)</li>
	<li>Extra languages. 1 or more languages other than Common, which every adventurer speaks.</li>
	<li>Proficiencies. 3 total proficiencies (tools, skills, or otherwise).</li>
	<li>Feature. One major-equivalent feature.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<div class="comment">
		<p>Many of the lineages and cultures of the Federated Nations have "traditional" attitudes toward gender roles. But adventurers are known to be weird. So they get a pass. You can play any gender, including non-binary. Be warned that some NPCs will react differently depending on their perceptions of your gender and how it meets the culture's expectations.</p>
	
		<p>A few specifics:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The dwarves of Fuar Uulan are very strictly heterosexual and monogamous. All regular adults are married and stay married to one person.</li>
			<li>The high-ranking gwerin tend to do arranged marriages--adults only gain stature in the community if they've provided at least one child as part of a contract marriage.</li>
			<li>The ihmisi, especially the more tribal folks, have very relaxed gender roles. Anyone can fulfil any societal role. Similarly, goblins have virtually no concept of gender and very little grasp of individuality within the tribes.</li>
			<li>The orcs of Wyrmhold tend to hold their women in regard--women tend to be the "glue" that holds the clans and tribes together.</li>
			<li>Halflings are generally deeply matriarchal, treating men as some combination of decorative, protected, and/or weak.</li>
		</ul>
