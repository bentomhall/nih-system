\section{Monstrosities}\label{sec:monstrosities}
Monstrosities are the catch-all category for things that aren't shaped roughly like a person. Does it speak but look like a \hyperref[sec:beasts]{beast}? Does it have magical abilities but not fit into another category? Was it created by a mage in a long-ago day but now breed normally? Then it's probably a monstrosity.

\begin{DndMonster}{Ankheg}
\DndMonsterType{Large monstrosity}

    extra={If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the ankheg can bite only the grappled creature and has advantage on attack rolls to do so.}
]
\DndMonsterAction{Spit} The ankheg spits acid in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide, provided that it has no creature grappled. Each creature in that line must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

\begin{DndMonster}{Basilisk}
	\DndMonsterType{Medium monstrosity}
	\DndMonsterBasics[armor-class={14 (natural armor)}, hit-points={52 (8d8 + 16)}, speed={20 ft.}]

	\DndMonsterDetails[saving-throws={}, skills={}, damage-immunities={}, damage-resistances={}, damage-vulnerabilities={}, condition-immunities={}, senses={darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 9}, languages={—}, challenge={2:2}]
	\DndMonsterAction{Petrifying Gaze} If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the \nameref{inc:restoration} incantation (greater only) or other magic.
	
	A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
	
	If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.

	]
	
	\DndMonsterAction{Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)} 
	The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	
	\DndMonsterAction{Swallow}
	The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.
	If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

	\DndMonsterSection{Actions}
	\DndMonsterAction{Multiattack} The chimera makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with its horns, and one with its claws. When its fire breath is available, it can use the breath in place of its bite or horns.

\end{DndMonster}

\begin{DndMonster}{Chuul}

	\DndMonsterAction{Amphibious} The chuul can breathe air and water.

	\DndMonsterAction{Sense Magic} The chuul senses magic within 120 feet of it at will. This trait otherwise works like the \nameref{inc:sense-aura} incantation but isn't itself magical.

	\DndMonsterSection{Actions}
	\DndMonsterAction{Multiattack} The chuul makes two pincer attacks. If the chuul is grappling a creature, the chuul can also use its tentacles once.
	\DndMonsterAttack[
		name=Pincer,
		distance=melee,
		type=weapon,
		mod=+6,
		reach=10,
		dmg=\DndDice{2d6 + 4},
		dmg-type=bludgeoning,
		extra={. The target is grappled (escape DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the chuul doesn't have two other creatures grappled.}
	]
	\DndMonsterAction{Tentacles}
	One creature grappled by the chuul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is paralyzed. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

\begin{DndMonster}{Cloaker}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\DndMonsterType{Large monstrosity}
\DndMonsterBasics[armor-class={14 (natural armor)}, hit-points={78 (12d10 + 12)}, speed={10 ft., fly 40 ft.}]

\DndMonsterAction{Damage Transfer} While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes the other half.

\DndMonsterAction{False Appearance} While the cloaker remains motionless without its underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.

\DndMonsterAction{Light Sensitivity} While in bright light, the cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

\DndMonsterSection{Actions}
\DndMonsterAction{Multiattack} The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.
\DndMonsterAttack[
	name=Bite,
	distance=melee,
	type=weapon,
	mod=+6,
	reach=5,
	dmg=\DndDice{2d6 + 3},
	dmg-type=piercing,
	extra={, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check.}
]
\DndMonsterAttack[
	name=Tail,
	distance=melee,
	type=weapon,
	mod=+6,
	reach=10,
	dmg=\DndDice{1d8 + 3},
	dmg-type=slashing
]
\DndMonsterAction{Moan}
Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours

\DndMonsterAction{Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)}
The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.

Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.

A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

	\DndMonsterAction{Echolocation} The darkmantle can't use its blindsight while deafened.

If the target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has advantage on the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target's head, and the target is also blinded and unable to breathe while the darkmantle is attached in this way. While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle's speed also becomes 0, it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target. A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13 Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.}
	]
	
	\DndMonsterAction{Darkness Aura (1/Day)}
	A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.

	\DndMonsterAction{Shapechanger} The doppelganger can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid it has seen, or back into its true form.

	\DndMonsterAttack[

		type=weapon,
		mod=+6,
		reach=5,
		dmg=\DndDice{1d6 + 4},
		dmg-type=bludgeoning
	]
	\DndMonsterAction{Read Thoughts}
	The doppelganger magically reads the surface thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range, the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the doppelganger's concentration isn't broken (as if concentrating on a spell). While reading the target's mind, the doppelganger has advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion) checks against the target.

	\DndMonsterAction{Luring Song}
	The harpy sings a magical melody. Every beast, monstrosity, humanoid, or giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.
	
	While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.
	
	A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24 hours.

If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.}

	\DndMonsterAction{Fling}
	One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.
	\DndMonsterAction{Lightning Storm (recharge 5-6)}
	The kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 120 feet of it. A target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	
	\DndMonsterSection{Legendary Actions}

The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	\DndMonsterAction{Deadly Leap}
	If the land shark jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone and take 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked prone, and is pushed 5 feet out of the land shark's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone in the land shark's space.

\DndMonsterAction{Petrifying Gaze} When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the \nameref{inc:restoration} (greater only).

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.
