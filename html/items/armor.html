		<h2 class="section">Armor, Magic</h2>
		
		This section contains the various magic items that are worn as armor or clothing, as well as shields.
		
		<h4>Boots, belts, cloaks, gloves, and helmets</h4>
		Even though many types of armor (especially heavy armor) have integrated sabatons (armored boots), belts, gauntlets, and helmets, you can wear magic items listed as boots, belts, cloaks, gloves (or gauntlets), or helmets (or hats) without reducing the protective qualities of the armor. Some magic items (such as the Demon Armor) may impose more specific restrictions. You must wear both of a pair of magic gloves or magic boots to gain any benefit from them. You can only gain the benefits of one pair of boots, one cloak, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one helmet or hat, and one belt at the same time, even if they do not require attunement.
		
		<h4>Robes</h4>
		Robes cannot be worn with any armor, magical or not, except a mithral breastplate or chain shirt (or armor like Aelven Chain, which acts as a mithral chain shirt).
		
		<h3 class="subsection">Adamantine Armor</h3>
		
		<p><em>Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), Adventurer</em></p>
		
		This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you're wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.
		
		<p><b>Formula</b> To craft Adamantine Armor, you must procure one-quarter of the weight of the armor in refined adamantine metal (three-quarters of the weight in raw adamantine ore). The cost of the crafting is twice the base price of the armor, four times if you wish to have masterwork adamantine armor. Crafting adamantine armor requires a +3 proficiency bonus (+4 if you are crafting masterwork) and proficiency in smith's tools.</p>
		
		<h3 class="subsection">Aelven Chain</h3>
		<p><em>Armor (masterwork chain shirt), Hero</em></p>
		
		This also counts as mithril. You are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with medium armor.
		
		<h3 class="subsection">Animated Shield</h3>
		<p><em>Armor (shield), Hero (requires attunement)</em></p>
		
		While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.
		
		<h3 class="subsection">Armor of Invulnerability</h3>
		<p><em>Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)</em></p>
		
		You have resistance to all damage while you wear this armor. Additionally, you can use an action to make yourself immune to damage from non-legendary effects for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing the armor. Once this special action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
		
		<h3 class="subsection">Armor of Energy Resistance</h3>
		<p><em>Armor (light, medium, or heavy), Hero (requires attunement)</em></p>
		
		You have resistance to one type of damage while you wear this armor. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.
<table>

		<h3>Armor of Physical Resistance</h3>
		<p><em>Armor (light, medium, or heavy), Hero (requires attunement)</em></p>

		<h3 class="subsection">Arrow-Catching Shield</h3>
		<p><em>Armor (shield), Hero (requires attunement)</em></p>
		
		You gain half cover against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.
		
		<h3 class="subsection">Belt of Giant Strength</h3>
		<p>Belt, varying tier (requires attunement)</p>
		
		While wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to a score granted by the belt. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than the belt's score, the item has no effect on you.
		
		Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The belt of stone giant strength and the belt of frost giant strength look different, but they have the same effect.
		
<table>
<tr><th>Type</th><th>Strength</th><th>Tier </th></tr>
<tr><td>Hill giant</td><td>+5</td><td>Hero       </td></tr>
<tr><td>Stone/frost giant</td><td>+6</td><td>Hero       </td></tr>

		<p>Boots, Hero (requires attunement)</p>
		
		While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action and click the boots' heels together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll.

		<h3 class="subsection">Circlet of Blasting</h3>
		<p>Hat, Adventurer</p>

		</ul>
		
		<h3 class="subsection">Cloak of Displacement</h3>
		<p>Cloak, Hero (requires attunement)</p>
		
		While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.
		
		<h3 class="subsection">Cloak of Protection</h3>
		<p>Cloak, Adventurer (requires attunement)</p>

		<h3 class="subsection">Dragon Scale Mail</h3>
		<p>Armor (masterwork scale mail), Hero (requires attunement)</p>
		
		Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids.
