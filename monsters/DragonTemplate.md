#### Dragon
I'm tired of having a crap-ton of dragon stat blocks, with some colors being stronger than others. So I'm attempting to slice and dice that.

Templates:
Hatchling (unified, CR 1)
Wyrmling (colored, but no metallic yet, CR 2-4)
Young (colored + metallic variants, CR 8-10)
Adult (CR 14-16)
Ancient (CR 20-24)

Colors -> Damage type + resistance/immunity
Metallic -> spell-casting + shapechange
Instructions for varying within the range
Different breath weapon shapes (line, cone, *ball*)

##### Existing dragons:
Format: Color CR HP AC ABS BW-damage BW Save

#### Young


Process:
1. Choose an age category.
2. Choose a color -> element + Save type
3. Choose a blast shape (adjusted for age)
4. Choose spells if metallic
5. Adjust for weaker/stronger

_Medium dragon, Arrogant and Inquisitive_

**Armor Class** 17 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 33 (6d8 + 6)

**Speed** 30 ft., fly 60 ft.

| STR     | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA     |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 15 (+2) | 10 (+0) | 13 (+1) | 10 (+0) | 11 (+0) | 13 (+1) |

**Saving Throws** Dex +2, Con +3, Wis +2, Cha +3

**Skills** Perception +4, Stealth +4

**Damage Immunities** Variable based on color

**Senses** blindsight 10 ft., darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14

**Languages** Draconic

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

**_Special Traits_**. Pick one of the following based on color:
- Amphibious: The dragon can breath both air and water.
- Ice Walk. The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost it extra moment.

**_Damage Type_**. The dragon's bite attacks and breath weapon deal damage based on its color. The saving throw also depends on the color
- Black: Necrotic (CON)
- Blue: Lightning (DEX)
- Brass: Thunder (CON)
- Bronze or Red: Fire (DEX)
- Copper or Green: Acid (DEX)
- Gold: Radiant (DEX)
- Silver or White: Cold (CON)

**_Blast Shape_**. The dragon's breath weapon targets an area chosen from the list below:
- Ball: 10 ft radius sphere centered on a point within 60 ft
- Cone: 15 ft cone
- Line: 15 ft line that is 5 ft wide

**Actions**

**_Bite_**. _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) damage of the dragon's damage type.

**_Breath Weapon (Recharge 5–6)_**. The dragon exhales energy in a burst (see Blast Shape). Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 saving throw (DEX or CON based on color), taking 22 (6d6) damage of the dragon's Damage Type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Scaling**
To make a CR 3 version, add 2 hit dice (15 HP), increase the ability scores to 18/12/16/13/11/15, which increases the bite's modifier to +6 and the damage to 1d10 + 4 + 2d4. Don't change the breath weapon.

To make a CR 4 version, add 6 hit dice (45 HP), increase the ability scores to 19/12/17/13/11/15, which increases the bite's modifier to +6 and the damage to 1d10 + 4 + 2d4. The breath weapon goes up to DC 13 and gains 1d6 damage.
