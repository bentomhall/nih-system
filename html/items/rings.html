<h2 class="section">Rings and Amulets</h2>\label{mi:rings}

<p>This section contains items worn as jewelry. Rings, amulets, broaches, earrings, bracers, etc. Almost all of these require attunement, which serves as the limiting factor on how many you can gain benefit from at a time.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Amulet of Health</h3>
<p>Wondrous item, Hero (requires attunement)</p>

<p>Your Constitution score is +4 while you wear this amulet. It has no effect on you if your Constitution is already +4 or higher.</p>

<p>Wondrous item, Adventurer (requires attunement)</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Amulet of the Planes</h3>
<p>Wondrous item, Hero (requires attunement)</p>

<p>While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the plane shift spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1-60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61-100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Bracers of Archery</h3>

<h3 class="subsection">Dimensional Shackles</h3>
<p>Wondrous item, Hero </p>

<p>You can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal. You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Eyes of Charming</h3>
<p>Wondrous item, Adventurer (requires attunement)</p>

<p>These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the</p>
<p><a href="../spells/allspells.html#charm-person">charm person</a> spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Eyes of Minute Seeing</h3>
<p>Wondrous item, Adventurer </p>

<p>While wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Ioun Stone</h3>
<p>Wondrous item, tier varies (requires attunement) </p>

<p>It's not clear why these stones are named "Ioun", but that name has been attested for hundreds of years. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color. When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.  A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.</p>

<p><b>Absorption (Hero)</b> While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell with cost of 8 AET or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.  Once the stone has canceled 40 aether-worth of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose cost is higher than the aether-cost the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.</p>

<p><b>Agility (Hero)</b> Your Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum of +5, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.</p>

<p><b>Awareness (Hero)</b> You can't be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.</p>

<p><b>Fortitude (Hero)</b> Your Constitution score increases by 1, to a maximum of +5, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.</p>

<p><b>Greater Absorption (Legendary)</b> While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell or legendary effect cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.</p>

<p>The spell has 150 charges. Cancelling a spell or legendary effect consumes a number of charges equal to the base aether cost of the effect (legendary effects count as costing 15 AET). Once all charges are used up, the stone loses its luster and becomes dull and stops orbiting. If you are targeted by an effect whose base cost is higher than the remaining charges, the stone cannot cancel that effect.</p>

<p><b>Insight (Hero)</b> Your Wisdom score increases by 1, to a maximum of +5, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.</p>

<p><b>Intellect (Hero)</b> Your Intelligence score increases by 1, to a maximum of +5, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.</p>

<p><b>Leadership (Hero)</b> Your Charisma score increases by 1, to a maximum of +5, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.</p>

<p><b>Mastery (Legendary)</b> Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.</p>

<p><b>Regeneration (Legendary)</b> You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.</p>

<p><b>Reserve (Hero)</b> This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 5 aether worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.</p>

<p>Any creature can cast a spell with aether cost less than 5 into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The aether used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.</p>

<p>While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the aether cost, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.</p>

<p><b>Strength (Hero)</b> Your Strength score increases by 1, to a maximum of +5, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.</p>

<p><b>Sustenance (Hero)</b> You don't need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Medallion of Thoughts</h3>
<p>Wondrous item, Adventurer (requires attunement)</p>

<p>The medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the <a href="../spells/allspells.html#detect-thoughts">detect thoughts</a> spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>

<h3 class="subsection">Necklace of Adaptation</h3>
<p>Wondrous item, Adventurer (requires attunement) </p>

<h3 class="subsection">Ring of Djinni Summoning</h3>
<p>Ring, legendary (requires attunement)</p>

<p>While wearing this ring, you can speak its command word as an action to summon a particular djinni from the Elemental Plane of Air. The djinni appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane.</p>

<p>While summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.</p>

<p>After the djinni departs, it can't be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the djinni dies.</p>
