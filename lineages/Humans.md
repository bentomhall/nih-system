### Humans
Known as “the devout kindred”, humans lacked the arcane power of the gwerin or the kami-blessed might of the puun ihmisia and so were the first to turn to the gods for aid. With this divine aid they built empires that lasted for centuries, until in their hubris they turned to the arts demonic and the empires fell into civil war, the War of Souls. This war blasted the landscape with abyssal power, tainting large portions and cutting others off from the rest of the universe (blasting them out of time).

Since then, humans have adapted. Now one of the most common races, their presence is felt in most of the Federated Nations. Three major varieties of human exist in this area--they are described below.

Night’s Children
The night’s children originally lived on the high-altitude Nocthian Plateau where they were devout worshipers of Nocthis, the Goddess of Night. After the Cataclysm caused an ice volcano to erupt beneath their capital and killed their Goddess, the survivors fled south to what is now Byssia. There they mingled with the local puun ihmisia. Unique among nations, they almost uniformly reject the current Congregation of gods, preferring to venerate ancestors and spirits of nature.

Physically, night’s children are a striking race. They all have very pale skin (shades of ivory). They do not burn in the sunlight--the superstitious call it a blessing from the Nocthis. The vast majority of them have jet-black hair, usually worn pulled back or pinned up. Almost always straight and long (especially on women). Those with significant elven heritage exhibit slight mottling of greys on their hair, almost like the shadow of leaves at night. Very occasional red with black undertones. They stand tall and statuesque. Wall-builders refer to them as "living statues." The bulkiest of the human variants, they tend to develop hard curves and muscles quite well, even the women. Their eyes are slightly slanted upward and range from ice-grey to bright jewel tones (including purples and brilliant blues). At night, their eyes seem to glow slightly, like cats.

Names: Night’s children are given a name and then, later in life, a cognomen (appellation) is added at the beginning or end of the name. Common male names include: Admitos, Damon, Adrianos, Aetos, Daphnis, Alkaios, Charklis, Herodis, Ion, Ipparchos, Savvas, and Lambros. Common female names include: Acathi, Adriani, Danai, Daphne, Dione, Eirene, Galini, Charis, Ippodamia, Sergia, and Sotiria.

Darkvision. As a gift from the dead goddess, night’s children have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of grey.
Region of Origin. Your region of origin is Byssia.
Fang-Kin
Fang-kin originate in the Jungle of Fangs, once the site of the Fanged Kingdom of aelvar; now the home of the Stone Throne. After magical engineering by the serpent-loving aelvar, centuries of isolation from the rest of humanity, and interbreeding with the remnants of those aelvar (to the point that none remain with even slightly pure blood), the fang-kin have diverged notably from the rest of humanity.

Physically, fang-kin have light, cool-toned skin. Patterns of colored blotches (like large freckles) are common, especially on the head, neck, and upper torso and upper arms. These often flush and darken with anger or excitement. They exhibit wild variation in hair color, although it is most often a pure jewel or metallic tone--jet black, brilliant silver, golden yellow, ruby red and amethyst purple are the most common, but greens and blues are not uncommon. Most have multiple shades or streaks. They commonly have short, slender stature. Graceful movement is the default. Most individuals are between 5'0" and 5’5", with some variation outside this. Women are slightly shorter than men, but not tremendously. Obesity is very rare. The ideal of feminine beauty is minimal curves and slender lines. Strong fang-kin rarely develop much visible musculature. Their facial features are elongated oval facial features and their eyes are grey to green. Some change in the light or with mood.

Names: Being a hierarchical society, the naming conventions vary by class. The three major classes are nobles (including clergy), tradesmen (including soldiers), and commoners. Given names are similar between the three classes, but the structure of the name and the surnames vary. Nobles are formally named Isal <Family name> <Given>. Tradesmen are given the name Lai <Profession> <Given>. Commoners go by <Given> pe <Location>.

Given names are androgynous and include: Balin, Chea, Da, Dara, Leng, Narong, Nimol, Srey, Son, Bopha, Chanda, Khan, Maly, Map, Phalla, Ry, Rith, Thy, Thuy, and Vanna.

Noble family names include: Sat’psa, Hvang, Boeng, and Prei.

Wall-builders
The least ancient sub-race of humans (and the most mixed in ancestry) are the wall-builders. They call the Council Lands home. Their ancestors were refugees from many pre-Cataclysm nations, forced to flee south from the site of the Battle of Acceptance and from the massive changes in the landscape that happened at the Cataclysm. Gathering around a small settlement and a newly-founded mage school/temple, they have built a very communal, highly-ordered society. It is also the home of many other races--both kinds of elves, dwarves, halflings, and the rare infernal- and celestial-touched tieflings and aasimar. They are also the most devout of the human sub-races.

A unique trait of the wall-builders (and the source of their name) is that they cluster together wherever they build settlements and always construct at least a token wall around their villages, no matter how small. Even single houses, if possible, will have a hedge or fence or wall. They don’t feel safe without one, even if there is no threat. Another oddity due to the genetic bottle-neck of the Cataclysm is that many (but not all) wall-builders are highly allergic to bee stings. Thus, they rarely work as apiarists or tend orchards, leaving that to other races.

Physically, their skin is medium-brown and warm-toned (cafe-au-lait). Darker shades are more common than lighter ones, but neither is particularly uncommon. Their hair is dark brown to black and mostly wavy or curly. While this is the most common shade, throwbacks to other ethnicities are common and unremarkable--red hair, blond hair, etc. Only hardy individuals survived, and compactness meant less bulk to feed, so they are short and stocky in stature. They tend to stand 5'2" to 5'6" tall, with women as tall as men. Taller individuals are uncommon, with 6'0" rarely reached by anyone. Obesity is becoming more common, especially among the wealthy. The fashion in attractiveness favors the well-fed and curved. Squared-off facial features with short noses and square jaws are the norm, as are dark eyes. As with hair color, there is substantial variation to all various colors, including ones not found on Earth.

Names: Humans of the Council Lands use names following the pattern <Given> <Profession>. Children are not given surnames until they are Judged and assigned a profession. Common male names include: John, William, James, George, Charles, Henry, Robert, and Thomas. Common female names include: Anna, Emma, Elza, Margaret, Ida, Clara, and Alice.
