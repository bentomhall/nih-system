#### Dragon
I'm tired of having a crap-ton of dragon stat blocks, with some colors being stronger than others. So I'm attempting to slice and dice that.

Templates:
Hatchling (unified, CR 1)
Wyrmling (colored, but no metallic yet, CR 2-4)
Young (colored + metallic variants, CR 8-10)
Adult (CR 14-16)
Ancient (CR 20-24)

Colors -> Damage type + resistance/immunity
Metallic -> spell-casting + shapechange
Instructions for varying within the range
Different breath weapon shapes (line, cone, *ball*)

##### Existing dragons:
Format: Color CR HP AC ABS BW-damage BW Save

#### Young


Process:
1. Choose an age category.
2. Choose a color -> element + Save type
3. Choose a blast shape (adjusted for age)
4. Choose spells if metallic
5. Adjust for weaker/stronger

**Languages** Draconic

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

**_Special Traits_**. Pick one of the following based on color:
- Amphibious: The dragon can breath both air and water.
- Ice Walk. The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost it extra moment.

**_Damage Type_**. The dragon's bite attacks and breath weapon deal damage based on its color. The saving throw also depends on the color
- Black: Necrotic (CON)
- Blue: Lightning (DEX)
- Brass: Thunder (CON)

- Copper or Green: Acid (DEX)

**Scaling**
To make a CR 3 version, add 2 hit dice (15 HP), increase the ability scores to 18/12/16/13/11/15, which increases the bite's modifier to +6 and the damage to 1d10 + 4 + 2d4. Don't change the breath weapon.

To make a CR 4 version, add 6 hit dice (45 HP), increase the ability scores to 19/12/17/13/11/15, which increases the bite's modifier to +6 and the damage to 1d10 + 4 + 2d4. The breath weapon goes up to DC 13 and gains 1d6 damage.
