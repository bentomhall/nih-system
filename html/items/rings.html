In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal. You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.</p>

			<h3 class="item-name">Ioun Stone</h3>
			<div class="item-type">Wondrous item</div>
			<div class="rarity">Varies</div>
			<div class="attunement">Attuned</div>
		</div>
		
		<p>It's not clear why these stones are named "Ioun", but that name has been attested for hundreds of years. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color. When you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.  A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.</p>
		
		<p><b>Absorption (Hero)</b> While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell with cost of 8 AET or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.  Once the stone has canceled 40 aether-worth of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose cost is higher than the aether-cost the stone has left, the stone can't cancel it.</p>
		
		<p><b>Agility (Hero)</b> Your Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum of +5, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.</p>
		
		<p><b>Awareness (Hero)</b> You can't be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.</p>
		
		<p><b>Fortitude (Hero)</b> Your Constitution score increases by 1, to a maximum of +5, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.</p>
		
		<p><b>Greater Absorption (Legendary)</b> While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell or legendary effect cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.</p>
		
		<p>The spell has 150 charges. Cancelling a spell or legendary effect consumes a number of charges equal to the base aether cost of the effect (legendary effects count as costing 15 AET). Once all charges are used up, the stone loses its luster and becomes dull and stops orbiting. If you are targeted by an effect whose base cost is higher than the remaining charges, the stone cannot cancel that effect.</p>
		
		<p><b>Insight (Hero)</b> Your Wisdom score increases by 1, to a maximum of +5, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.</p>
		
		<p><b>Intellect (Hero)</b> Your Intelligence score increases by 1, to a maximum of +5, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head.</p>
		
		<p><b>Leadership (Hero)</b> Your Charisma score increases by 1, to a maximum of +5, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head.</p>
		
		<p><b>Regeneration (Legendary)</b> You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.</p>
		
		<p><b>Reserve (Hero)</b> This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 5 aether worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.</p>
		
		<p>Any creature can cast a spell with aether cost less than 5 into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The aether used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.</p>
		
		<p>While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the aether cost, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.</p>
		
		<p><b>Strength (Hero)</b> Your Strength score increases by 1, to a maximum of +5, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.</p>
		
		<p><b>Sustenance (Hero)</b> You don't need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.</p>

		<p>While wearing this ring, you are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know your alignment, or know your creature type. Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it.</p>
		
		<p>You can use an action to cause the ring to become invisible until you use another action to make it visible, until you remove the ring, or until you die.</p>
		
		<p>If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for the afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can't prevent this telepathic communication.</p>

		<p><b>Attunement Restriction:</b> Attunement must be completed outdoors at night.</p>

		<p>While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast <a href="../spells/allspells.html#dancing-lights">dancing lights</a> and <a href="../spells/allspells.html#light">light</a> from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.  The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
		
		<p><b>Faerie Fire</b> You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast <a href="../spells/allspells.html#faerie-fire">faerie fire</a> from the ring.</p>
		
		<p><b>Ball Lightning</b> You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.  Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.</p>
		
		<p>As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created.</p>

		<p><b>Shooting Stars</b> You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

		<p>This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 12 aether worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 6 aether of stored spells chosen by the GM.</p>
		
		<p>Any creature can cast a spell costing 12 or less aether into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The base aether cost of the spell determines how much space it uses.</p>
		
		<p>While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the base aether cost, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.</p>

		<p><b>Note:</b> If the spell was stored in the ring when found, assume that the caster had a spell save DC of 16, spellcasting ability modifier of +4 and a spell attack modifier of +8.</p>

		<p>While wearing this ring, you have advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). In addition, if you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the spell has no effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.</p>

While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of its charges to attack one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The ring produces a spectral ram's head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.  Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring's charges as an action to try to break an object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn't being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge you spend.</p>

The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.</p>
