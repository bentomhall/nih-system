			<li><b>Cultural Mimicry: Like a Fish</b> Choose any feature granted by a different culture than the one you chose. You have a swim speed equal to half your speed.</li>
			<li><b>Serpentine Grace</b> The fang-kin prize grace and dancing. Most who grow up here are more flexible than those of other cultures, no matter their lineage. You can squeeze through spaces one size smaller than yourself without penalty. In addition, you can move through enemies spaces as long as they are one size larger or smaller than yourself instead of two, although the spaces are still difficult terrain.</li>
