### Orcs
Orcs, like humans, are the product of aelvar meddling with hobgoblins. Cursed by blood-rage and stigmatized as savages for centuries, they fought for the Army of Darkness at the Cataclysm. In the aftermath of the Battle of Acceptance, some kept to their brutal ways; others chose a new path. About 40 years ago, a powerful shaman of the Skem tribe had a vision in which a chilling frost spread out of the Kairen Mountains and covered the land. In this vision, she saw that the only path to the preservation of her people was for them (and other tribes) to join the struggling Remnant Dynasty in their losing battle against the Hungering Frost. Four tribes (including her own Skem) accepted the call of duty.

In the following decades, the orcs of the Kard, Ko, Skem, and Tabar tribes have become a major part of Wyrmhold’s strength. The ferocity and military power of Tabar, the resource-gathering of Kard, the protection from raiders offered by Ko (as well as the artifacts recovered from pre-Cataclysm ruins), and the mystical power of Skem have given the dragonborn and goblin kingdom breathing room, leading to the current stabilization of the situation. Since the fall of the Frost, they have continued to strengthen the kingdom, although cracks are beginning to show in these peaceful times.

Not all orcs are from those tribes. Over to the east, across Lake Coy'in, some tribes have mingled (willingly or not) with the local humans of Dreamshore. While the tribes themselves are not part of the Duarchy of Kotimaa, half-breed children occasionally seek their human roots in the more settled lands. Another group of orcs in Godsfall were altered by demonic machinations--their reddened skin and enlarged tusks bear record of this alteration.

Physically, orcs are tall and bulky. They average between 5’5” and 6’6” and weigh between 180 and 240 lbs. Females are usually slightly slimmer than males, but just as tall and muscled. Their hair is usually dark brown or black and thick. Their skin has a light green-grey tint to it. They become more green when tanned. Almost all orcs have tattoos showing their clan affiliation. These start on the back of one hand (left for females, right for males) and continue up the arm. It is normal to keep that arm uncovered where possible. Their eyes are green, brown, or red. When angry, all their eyes become visibly redder.
