\section{Monstrosities}\label{sec:monstrosities}
Monstrosities are the catch-all category for things that aren't shaped roughly like a person. Does it speak but look like a \hyperref[sec:beasts]{beast}? Does it have magical abilities but not fit into another category? Was it created by a mage in a long-ago day but now breed normally? Then it's probably a monstrosity.

\subparagraph*{Ankheg}
The ankheg, commonly called a tunnel worm, is a large centipede-like creature with a broad head and mandibles made for digging. They are a common pest in the plains areas that particularly prey on livestock, preferring to burrow underneath and emerge to grab a cow or horse. Their acid spit is reserved for bigger threats.
\begin{DndMonster}{Ankheg}

    extra={If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the ankheg can bite only the grappled creature and has advantage on attack rolls to do so.}
]
\DndMonsterAction{Spit} The ankheg spits acid in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide, provided that it has no creature grappled. Each creature in that line must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

	\DndMonsterAction{Petrifying Gaze} If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the \smartnameref{inc:restoration}{\textit{restoration}} incantation (greater only) or other magic.
	
	A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
	
	If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.

\subparagraph*{Behir}
The salamander-like behir lives in the waste places and deserts. While it is best known for hating dragons (and even seeking out dragon nests to eat the young), behir are equal-opportunity killers. Completely non-social, it's believed that they are hermaphrodites whose only interaction with each other is to breed, after which they separate. They abandon their young soon after they hatch.

	]
	
	\DndMonsterAction{Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)} 
	The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	
	\DndMonsterAction{Swallow}
	The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.

	If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

	\DndMonsterSection{Actions}
	\DndMonsterAction{Multiattack} The chimera makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with its horns, and one with its claws. When its fire breath is available, it can use the breath in place of its bite or horns.
	\DndMonsterAttack[

	\DndMonsterAction{Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6)}
	The dragon head exhales fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 (7d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
	\DndMonsterSection{Variants}
	\DndMonsterAction{Greater Chimera} Some chimera are more powerful and intelligent. Increase the hit points to 133 (14d10 + 56), and give them the following abilities, all usable instead of its breath as part of a Multiattack. Their DR is now 7 and their OR is now 10.
	\subparagraph*{Heaven's Cry (Recharge 5-6)} All creatures within 60 feet but not within 10 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Creatures that fail their save are \smartnameref{condition:staggered}{staggered} until the end of their next turn.
	\subparagraph*{Ram's Keeper (Recharge 5-6)}  The chimera's ram's head causes ice to coalesce around all creatures within 10 feet of a point it can see within 60 ft. All affected creatures must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, targets take 27 (6d8) cold damage and are stunned until the end of their next turn. On a success, they take half as much damage. The area becomes difficult terrain for one minute.

	\DndMonsterAction{Amphibious} The chuul can breathe air and water.

	\DndMonsterAction{Sense Magic} The chuul senses magic within 120 feet of it at will. This trait otherwise works like the \smartnameref{inc:sense-aura}{\textit{sense aura}} incantation but isn't itself magical.

	\DndMonsterSection{Actions}
	\DndMonsterAction{Multiattack} The chuul makes two pincer attacks. If the chuul is grappling a creature, the chuul can also use its tentacles once.
	\DndMonsterAttack[
		name=Pincer,
		distance=melee,
		type=weapon,
		mod=+6,
		reach=10,

		extra={. The target is grappled (escape DC 13) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the chuul doesn't have two other creatures grappled.}
	]
	\DndMonsterAction{Tentacles}
	One creature grappled by the chuul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is stunned. If the roll is 8 or lower, the target is paralyzed instead. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

\DndMonsterAction{Damage Transfer} While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes the other half.

\DndMonsterAction{False Appearance} While the cloaker remains motionless without its underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.

\DndMonsterAction{Light Sensitivity} While in bright light, the cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

\DndMonsterSection{Actions}
\DndMonsterAction{Multiattack} The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.
\DndMonsterAttack[

	mod=+6,
	reach=5,

	extra={, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check.}

\DndMonsterAttack[

	distance=melee,
	type=weapon,
	mod=+6,
	reach=10,
	dmg=\DndDice{1d8 + 3},
	dmg-type=slashing
]
\DndMonsterAction{Moan}
Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker other than another cloaker that can hear its moan must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become shaken until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If the total was 8 or less, the creature is instead frightened. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours

\DndMonsterAction{Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)}
The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.

Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.

A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle's speed also becomes 0, it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target.

	\DndMonsterAction{Darkness Aura (1/Day)}
	A 15-foot radius of opaque magical darkness extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.

	The harpy sings a magical melody. Every beast, monstrosity, humanoid, or giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.
	
	While charmed by the harpy, a target cannot take any actions and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.
	
	A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24 hours.

	\DndMonsterAction{Deadly Leap}
	If the land shark jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 14 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked prone and take 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked prone, and is pushed 5 feet out of the land shark's space into an unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is within range, the creature instead falls prone in the land shark's space.

\DndMonsterAction{Petrifying Gaze} When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the \smartnameref{inc:restoration}{\textit{restoration}} (greater only).

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.

\DndMonsterAction{Swallow}
The remorhaz makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the remorhaz, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the remorhaz's turns.

If the remorhaz takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the remorhaz must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

\DndMonsterAction{False Appearance} While the roper remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal cave formation, such as a stalagmite.

\DndMonsterAction{Grasping Tendrils} The roper can have up to six tendrils at a time. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a tendril deals no damage to the roper, which can extrude a replacement tendril on its next turn. A tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC 15 Strength check against it.

\DndMonsterAction{Spider Climb} The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
