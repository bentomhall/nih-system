\section{Beasts}\label{sec:beasts}
Beasts, also called "normal animals", are the bulk of the fauna of the fantasy realm. Most of the creatures here could be mistaken (if not for unusual size in some cases) as their counterparts on Earth. They participate normally in the circle of life and their origins are entirely mundane.

As a general rule, beasts have very few if any magical abilities and do not speak any language. Thus, a dire wolf is a beast, while both the warg (which can speak) and the winter wolf (which breathes elemental cold) are \nameref{sec:monstrosities}.
