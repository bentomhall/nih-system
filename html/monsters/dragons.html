		<h1 class="section">Dragons</h1>
		<p>All dragons trace their descent from the wyrms of old, primal forces of destruction whose speech unmade matter, returning it to pure elemental force. True dragons retain the largest portion of that essence and are tied to elements; false dragons were either bred from wyrm essence or are the non-sapient descendents of corrupted dragons.</p>
		<h2 class="subsection">Dragon, True</h2>
		<p>All true dragons are born as chromatic, rainbow colored hatchlings. Before they leave the nest, they undergo the First Molt, which involves seeking out a form of elemental or planar energy and encysting themselves inside, becoming attuned to that elemental energy if they survive, awakening as wyrmlings. As they grow, they undergo a Second Molt, becoming young dragons when their hoard imperative awakens. This hoard imperative is the driving force for all maturing true dragons. It commands them to seek out and gather <em>something</em>, which could be as simple as shiny coins or gems...or as esoteric as the smiles on people's faces when they hear a story. This hoard serves as the dragon's strength and weakness--it channels the aether of the land to the dragon, extending their lifespans and fueling their power (both physical and magical), but if it is lost or destroyed, the dragon experiences extreme trauma, often dying (but not before going berserk and destroying everything around it). Some few dragons can find a new hoard, but dragons protect their hoards with their lives. Once a young dragon collects enough of a hoard, it undergoes the Third Molt, becoming an adult. Adult dragons are mature and fertile, forming bonds with other dragons. Most dragons end their lifecycle here; a few have the added need to dominate other dragons. These eventually undergo a Fourth Molt, becoming the fearsome ancients, leaders of dragon flights. Many dragons have the ability to transform into mortal forms (although they retain their draconic power)</p>
		<p>Dragons are intensely magical creatures--their very bones and body is steeped in elemental energy. As such, a true dragon's corpse is quite valuable to alchemists and crafters and mages of all kinds; the eggs of true dragons (which can last centuries in a "fossilized" state before hatching when exposed to the correct energies) have been used as arcane power sources. Both of these uses cause extremely negative from any true dragons who discover them.</p>
		<p>Some dragons seek out and learn mortal magic--this effort leaves them visually changed for reasons that are not clear. Their scales become metallic. Generally, metallic dragons are more tolerant of humanoid mortals than their chromatic (non-metallic) kin; their hoards tend to reflect their mortal-focused nature. This does not make them less dangerous. For many metallics, manipulating mortals is a form of a game and they have little concern for the wellbeing of their play pieces except as sources of their hoard.</p>

		<h2 class="subsection">Dragons, False</h2>
		<p>False dragons are debased draconic creatures, most of whom have lost their elemental nature and intelligence. Little more than beasts, they are still very dangerous.</p>
		<h2>Wyvern</h2>
		<p>The wyvern is a two-legged dragon with wings attached to its arms (like a bat). They lack fore-claws, but have powerful claws on their feet. Their tail has a poison stinger, which they use to great effect.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Uncommon but well-known.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> The hills and mountains of central Noefra are home to many wyvern nests, as is the outer barrier range. The humanoid inhabitants destroy them where possible, but a nest of wyverns makes for dangerous prey. Thankfully, wyverns are not particularly sociable and are found solo or in pairs, possibly with some young.</p>
		<p><b>Tactics:</b> Wyverns have animal cunning, mostly attacking out of hunger. They will attempt to take prey (especially herd animals) back as food rather than sticking around and fighting to the death unless confronted at their nests. They prefer to drop out of the sky on unsuspecting herds.</p>

		<h2>Dragon Turtles</h2>
		<p>While not true dragons, these colossal turtles dominate their aquatic domain. Their only natural enemy is the kraken and certain other Leviathan-exiles. Intelligent, they will interact with mortals. Beware seemingly idyllic islands, however--sometimes those are dragon turtles, asleep in the water. Dragon turtles are only rarely malicious, although those that unnecessarily harm sea life may find their boats torn apart or their bodies cooked by hot steam.</p>
		<h3>Habitat and Tactics</h3>
		<p><b>Commonality:</b> Legendary.</p>
		<p><b>Habitat:</b> The Primal Sea. The Sea Folk have reported seeing several among the islands north of Soefra, but try to avoid them. Thankfully, dragon turtles are mostly loners.</p>

			<div class="monster-action"><p><b>Steam Breath (Recharge 5-6).</b></p>
				<p>The dragon turtle exhales scalding steam in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.</p>
